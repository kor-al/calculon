See that? They all assume I’m a patient because of this cane.
I don’t want them to think I’m a doctor.
People don’t want a sick doctor.
The one who can’t talk, I liked that part.
And your cousin doesn’t like the diagnosis. I wouldn’t either. Brain tumor, she’s gonna die, boring.
You’re the oncologist; I’m just a lowly infectious disease guy.
She’s 29. Whatever she’s got is highly unlikely.
That’s an HMO lab; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.
I thought your uncle died of cancer.
That you know of.
None of which is even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?
And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.
Is she a doctor?
Everybody lies.
No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.
If we don’t talk to them they can’t lie to us, and we can’t lie to them. Humanity is overrated. I don’t think it’s a tumor.
Are you in first year of medical school? No. First of all, there’s nothing on the CAT scan. Second of all, if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office. Differential diagnosis, people: if it’s not a tumor what are the suspects? Why couldn’t she talk?
Get her a contrast MRI.
Mad zebra.
No, blood thiamine level was normal.
Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let’s find out what kind of zebra we’re dealing with here.
Really? Well, that’s odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.
No, just that I can’t think of anything that I’d be interested in.
I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?
I’m here from 9 to 5.
Rough year.
I call back. Sometimes I misdial.
See, I was right, this doesn’t interest me.
It’s 5:00. I’m going home.
Nice.
Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren’t going to fire me.
Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, “You can’t always get what you want.”
You pulled my authorization.
No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.
If you’re gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.
I’m ANGRY! You’re risking a patient’s life.
You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I’m still work here you have…[interrupted]
So, because you want me to treat patients, you aren’t letting me treat patients.
Do the MRI, she folded. [Ducklings leave, House turns to Wilson] I’ve gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time I’ve missed. 2054. I’ll be caught up in 2054. [He walks into the clinic] You better love this cousin a whole lot.
Told you, can’t trust people.
Can’t get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words.
We need to know if there’s some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.
Truth begins in lies. Think about it.
12:52 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes.
Can’t you give out the aspirin yourself? I’ll do paperwork.
Cough just won’t go away, runny nose looks a funny color.
I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The color?
You mean yellow; it’s jaundice.
Well, how orange?
Painkillers.
No, ‘cause they’re yummy. You want one? It’ll make your back feel better.
Unfortunately, you have a deeper problem. Your wife is having an affair.
You’re orange, you moron! It’s one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn’t picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she’s just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?
The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good lawyer.
Deep breath.
Has he been using his inhaler?
Your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too. She probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing. Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years, don’t you think? Ok, I’m gonna assume that no body’s ever told you what asthma is, or if they have, you had other things on your mind. A stimulant triggers cells in your child’s airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract. Mucus production increases, cell-lining starts to shed. But the steroids, the steroids…stop the inflammation. The more often this happens…[trails off and starts to leave the room]
Forget it. If you don’t trust steroids, you shouldn’t trust doctors.
Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone.
So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.
Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it’s vasculitus except that it could be.
Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we’re right.
We learn something else.
It’s not the parrot.
How many kids were there in the class?
How many are home sick?
None, but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher. You’ve been through her home?
Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?
Far as I know she’s running a Meth Lab out of her basement.
And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly. [Sigh] Ok, I’ll give you a for instance. The lady back there, who made your egg-salad sandwich. Her eyes look glassy, did you notice that? Now hospital policy is to stay home if you’re sick, but if you’re making $8.00 an hour, then ya kinda need the $8.00 an hour right? The sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities, but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve isn’t hyper concerned about sanitary conditions. So what do ya think? Should I trust her? I want you to check the patient’s home for contaminants, garbage, medication…[interrupted]
Isn’t that how you got into the Felker’s home? [pause] Yeah, I know, court records are sealed, you were 16, it was a stupid mistake, but your old gym teacher has a big mouth. You should write a thank you note.
Well, I needed somebody around here with street smarts. Ok? Knows when you’re being conned, knows how to con.
I’m pretty sure you can’t sue somebody for wrongful hiring.
I’m doing research. People are fascinating aren’t they?
Well, she’s my patient that’s what you do with patients. You give them medicine.
You’re comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.
She’s my patient.
I did not get her sick, she is not an experiment, I have a legitimate theory about what’s wrong with her.
There’s never any proof. 5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence.
I don’t, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption. And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?
Come on.
People used to have more respect for cripples you know! [Turns to a guy in a wheelchair] They didn’t really.
Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?
Cool, huh?
How long do we have?
We’re gonna stop all treatment.
No, it’s not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don’t know what.
Yeah, we’re gonna watch her die. Specifically we’re gonna watch how fast she’s dying. You just told us, each diagnosis has its own timeframe. When we see how fast it’s killing her we’ll know what it is.
Well, I got nothing. How ‘bout you?
Any other reason you think you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?
It’s kinda the definition of getting older.
Apparently not while researching this stuff on the internet.
[Looks contemplative, and then serious] Excellent diagnosis [sarcastic]!
[heavy sigh] Ya know, I think there just might be.
I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar.
Exam room 2. [Places the bottle back on the counter.]
It’s not a tumor; she’s getting worse too fast. She can’t stand up.
You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn’t explain these symptoms?
You idiot!
Not you, him! You said you didn’t find anything.
You found ham.
Where there’s ham there’s pork, where there’s pork there’s neurocysticercosis.
It fits. Could have been living there for years, it never occurred to me [interrupted]
OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?
In a typical case if you don’t cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae. They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel, they live, they grow up, they reproduce.
That’s because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go.
Not all of them. Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream. And where does the blood stream go?
As long as it’s healthy the immune system doesn’t even know it’s there. The worm builds a wall, uses secretions to shut down the body’s immune response and control fluid flow. It’s really kinda beautiful.
It’s too late for that. It’s dying, and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host’s defenses. The immune system wakes up and attacks the worm and everything starts to swell, and that is very bad for the brain.
No, no, no, no, you see, it fits, it’s perfect! It explains everything.
I can prove it by treating it.
[To nurse] Will you excuse us, please?
I’m Dr. House.
You’re being an idiot. Ahem. [Pause] You have a tapeworm in your brain, it’s not pleasant, but if we don’t do anything you’ll be dead by the weekend.
When you’re all better I’ll show you my diplomas.
I’m not talking about a treatment; I’m talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die.
 I had an infarction.
It’s what happens when the blood flow is obstructed. If it’s in the heart it’s a heart attack. If it’s in the lungs it’s a pulmonary embolism. If it’s in the brain it’s a stroke. I had it in my thigh muscles.
There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death.
I hoped I was dying.
When you’re scared, you’ll turn into me.
There’s no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we’re 90, sometimes before we’re even born, but it always happens and there’s never any dignity in it. I don’t care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It’s always ugly, always. [Pause] You can live with dignity, we can’t die with it.
No treatment.
But she does.
That didn’t happen here.
I solved the case, my work is done.
Patients always want proof, we’re not making cars here, we don’t give guarantees.
Yeah, yeah, yeah what’s the damn idea?
Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we’re not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he’s right, we should x-ray her, but we don’t x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle. If she’s got one in her head I guarantee you there’s one in her leg.
Does it matter?
Why?
No, it just seems that way because you can’t think of an answer. Does it make a difference why I think I’m a jerk? The only thing that matters is what you think. Can you do the job?
No, it wasn’t a racial thing, I didn’t see a black guy. I just saw a doctor…with a juvenile record. I hired Chase ‘cause his dad made a phone call. I hired you because you are extremely pretty.
I can’t believe that that would shock you. It’s also not what I said. No, I hired you because you look good; it’s like having a nice piece of art in the lobby.
But not THE top.
Yes, you were a very good applicant.
Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?
But you didn’t have to. People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That’s a law of nature, and you defied it. That’s why I hired you. You could have married rich, could have been a model, you could have just shown up and people would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff, but you didn’t, you worked your stunning little ass off.
Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they’re as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?
Sexually assaulted?
But you are damaged, aren’t you?
You said she was your cousin. Why would you lie?
You lied to a friend to save a stranger, you don’t think that’s screwed up?
I NEVER lie.
Got change for a dollar?
Close the door. Close the door!
She’s knows I’m in here, the clinic, as she commanded; she just doesn’t know I’m alone.
I’m off at 4:00.
I go out there, I get assigned a kid with a runny nose. That’s 30 seconds looking at the nose; 25 minutes talking to a worried mom who won’t leave until she sure it’s not meningitis or a tumor.
That would be lying.
Not the definition of case though.
Cameron is answering my mail.
Research?
So, 4:03 PM. Dr. House checks out. Please write that down.
Sorry, done for the day. There’s plenty of docs here to take care of you.
Hah, nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic, which means there are no appointments. It means you walk in, sign the chart and a doctor will see you, just not me.
Not a big letter writer.
When did my signature get so girly?
See that “G”, see how it makes a big loop on top? It doesn’t even look like my handwriting. Think I have something? What’s the differential diagnosis for writing “G’s” like a junior high school girl?
Perseverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun. Low-rider jeans are hot.
Night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?
To see the family.
9 times out of 10 there’s no reason to talk to a patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family. Good work.
Margins look fine. No lesions, color is good. How long have you been having night terrors?
Nothing, it’s just fun watching him blink. [To Dan] Name as many animals as you can that begin with the letter “B” go.
Baby elephant is actually a good answer; “B” is a bear of a letter.
Proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is never going to be chief fry cook. In teens there are two likely causes of night terrors: post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school?
Well, then, Dave…
I say it here, it comes out there. This lack of response is consistent with abuse.
[To Cameron] Did you know that he got hit in the head?
Yeah, why bother.
You hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis. Cool. ER obviously screwed up, kid’s got a concussion.
Well, that changes everything, you need glasses. That’s why you had double vision, which is why you got hit, which is why you have a concussion, which is why you have night terrors. You need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not.
You’re an only child, aren’t you?
Everything is about you. This may seem incredibly controversial, but I think sexual abuse is bad. I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t being diddled by daddy, or mommy, anything else is just a bonus.
[attention on Dan] Interesting.
Don’t move. Did I bore you in there?
Are you tired?
Right now, at this moment, are you tired?
That twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?
It’s called a myoclonic jerk, it’s very common when you’re falling asleep. Respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up.
So, he’s not asleep, he’s awake. [Turns to Cameron] Admit him.
I recognize that loopy “G”. So, what does the jerk tell us?
A movement disorder, or degenerative brain disease. Either way this kid’s gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.
You wish. No fever, no white count. Anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don’t have an accurate family history?
You didn’t even take an accurate family. His father’s not his father.
30% of all dads out there don’t realize they’re raising someone else’s kid.
That’s what our moms would like us to believe.
Fifty bucks says I’m right.
Hit a nerve? Don’t worry, Foreman. I’m sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy.
Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.
That’s a good point. Before we condemn this kid, maybe we should entertain Dr. Chase’s skepticism. I want a detailed polysomnograph. If he’s having night terrors I want to see them.
I’m not restraining you for them. EEG revealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.
Fixing it.
Oh, they know all about this.
This is gonna hurt, Dan.
Ok, but let’s pretend there’s something and go from there. Who sees something on this MRI?
He’s 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain. The smallest thing is abnormal.
Excellent, you see what he did there? He took a small clue that there’s a neurological problem and wasn’t afraid to run with it.
No, there’s not, he's completely wrong.
He knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess. Clever, but also pathetic.
Take a close look at the corpus callosum.
Are we all looking at the same thing? 200 million interhemispheric nerve fibers, the George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain. It’s subtle.
Are you guessing?
Too bad, you’re right.
Yeah, he probably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position. Something is pushing on it.
Do you see a tumor on this MRI?
There’s no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms. Today
He’s lucky to have you as his doctors.
Yummy.
Mmhmm. No fever, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates.
Think they don’t work?
Mmmm. May I? [He takes the frog and starts to do the gribbit noise with the baby]
Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. [The baby laughs] All natural, no dyes. That’s a good business: all-natural children’s toys.  Those toy companies, they don’t arbitrarily mark up their frogs. They don’t lie about how much they spend on research and development. The worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog.
Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. You know another really good business? Teeny tiny baby coffins. You can get them in frog green or fire engine red. Really. The antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for 6 months, which is why these companies think they can gouge you. They think that you’ll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive. Want to change things? Prove them wrong. A few hundred parents like you decide they’d rather let their kid die then cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination, believe me, prices will drop REALLY fast. Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit.
A cold.
Complications in surgery?
Really?
Which means multiple sclerosis. And the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?
Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens.
Oh, McDonald. Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.
Well if it is, it’s gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indicate rapidly progressive MS. Not the fun MS with the balloons and the bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs.
Start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5. Break it to the family. I’m going home.
Dr. Cuddy, great outfit.
No, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home.
Yeah, I got that part from the message. You said I was needed immediately.
I agree, he’s gonna have a very nasty headache. That would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.
[Sighs] This is not a toddler wandering around a department store. He’s 16. You’ll find him. I’m going home.
No, I mean “Call me if I can do something.” I’m bad at search parties and I’m bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing.
Why? You think they’re hiding him? Make sure someone checks the roof; some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.
Dr. Foreman. I assume you found the kid.
Suicidal?
Conscious?
How’d you talk him down?
How come you didn’t do it?
Come on, you can ride up with me.
Anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.
Why does everyone always think I’m being sarcastic? This is great news! He doesn’t have MS. The parents should be thrilled, well, the mom anyway. Of course, the dad probably doesn’t know…[interrupted]
He was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this? [Asking Foreman about the coffee]
He was in an acute confusional state, which doesn’t fit with a demyelinating disease like MS.
Right, he has an infection in his brain.
Well, it might get complicated. We work together. I am older, certainly, but maybe you like that.
Heh, nice cover.
We don’t need a definitive test to confirm this.
Ok, let’s wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid’s brain turns to mush.
Well, it is if it’s neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30%, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120%.
We’re not going to wait for that. The most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.
Show of hands. Who thinks I’m not in my right mind?
And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?
Who thinks there’s a third option?
Very good, what’s the third choice?
Excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture.
Geesh. It’s infected, with a really big hole like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure.
Although the wound is irregular, not cylindrical, it’s shaped like a triangle, so not a nail. Steak knife?
[Whispered] Nail File. Yeah, pain’ll make you do stupid things. Something to take the edge off? [Takes out his pills and puts one in his hand]
Cheers. [Dry swallows the pill and Funsten eats his (ewwwww)] [Limps back
Here on work?
Does your penis hurt?
No, just thought I’d toss you a really inappropriate question. Your lawyer’s gonna love it.
You’re from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?
Now, why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose? It’s the free-flowing pus that’s the tip-off.
Not for family, not for work. You drove 70 miles to a walk-in-clinic. You passed two hospitals on the road. Now, either you have a problem with those hospitals, or they have a problem with you. My guess is that you’ve sued half the doctors in Maplewood, and the rest are now refusing to treat you. It’s ironic, isn’t it? It’s like the boy who sued wolf. You know what? I bet we have a doctor here named Wolfe. How perfect would that be? I’m gonna page him.
I didn’t say I wouldn’t treat you. We’ll drain your knee, run some lab work, fix you right up.
I’m a people person.
All I know is that he sued some doctors, who am I to assume that they didn’t have it coming to them. [Stops when he sees Cuddy coming] The cutest little tennis outfit, my God I thought I was going to have a heart attack.[Acts like he just realized that Cuddy was there.] Oh my, I didn’t see you there, that is so embarrassing.
Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that.
You have very acute hearing.
In due course, of course.
Doesn’t sound like me.
You think?
[Stage whisper] My guy knows a guy who can get you in for $50 bucks.
And if I win, no clinic hours for a week.
So, either it’s a bad batch of penicillin, or our diagnosis is wrong. Square one. “Mignight.”
There goes metabolic. [Crosses off “M”]
“I” for inflammation. [Crosses out the “I”]
“D”, see ya. [Crosses out the “D”] “N” for neoplastic?
“I” for inflammation.
Stupid to have two I’s in one mneumonic. What’s the other one?
Trauma, later much. [Looks at the board which is now all crossed out.] You know the problem? Midnight is actually spelled with a “G” and an “H,” If we could just figure out what those two letters stand for. [Sighs and walks away for the board. His back is now facing the ducklings] It’s a sick brain, having fun, torturing him, talking to him. [pause] Scaring the hell out of him. Get him an EEG, left and right EOG esophageal microphones. If this thing wants to talk, let’s listen.
We’re missing something. This is screwed up.
I panicked, ok? Sounded cool though, they bought it.
Oh, crap. Another reason I don’t like meeting patients. If they don’t know what you look like they can’t yell at you. [Aside to Wilson] Here we go.
If I eat standing up, I spill.
I’m sorry, you need to vent, I understand.
Blood pressure’s 110/70, the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle, the EKG shows a normal QRS with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads. LFTs are elevated but only twice the normal range. Oh yeah, and he’s hearing voices. [Pause] Go hold his hand. Go on; I’ll bus your tray.
Got any sample bags on you?
Their son is deathly ill, I know it’s terrible, but the fact is if I don’t keep busy with trivial things like this I’m afraid I might start to cry.
Yeah? You want to double the bet?
General Hospital is on channel 6.
No epileptiform activity. [Turns to Cameron] What are you doing?
Good, run DNA on these. [He puts down two cups that are labeled “Mommy” and “Daddy???”]
Parents’ coffee cups.
I’ve had this conversation once already. If you’ve got something else to do, do it. Otherwise, do this.
Hey, Mr. Funsten! I was wondering when you’d be back. Got some papers for me?
I certainly hope so. [Funsten hands him an envelope] What? Too cheap to have your lawyer serve it for you, or is it more fun this way?
You have gonorrhea.
Well, maybe you’re right, but I have a lab result that says you do. It could be a false positive; normally I’d run a second test, but since you’re here I’ll just go with the first.
It’s reportable you know, public health issue.
Oh, don’t bother yourself, the state will call for you. Look, if you’re clean I’m sure this will all blow over, no big deal. There’s an easy way to find out, get one of your doctors to run a test.
Uh-uh. These are mine now. I’ll see you in court. [House enters the elevator.]
You idiots! You lied to me!
Can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs? Theirs is bigger. You’re not Dan’s parents.
I do.
Listen, when we were taking his medical history, were you confused? Did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition, or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world?
I sampled their DNA.
Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.
Again, why are we getting hung up on what I did? [Turns to Dan’s parents] Your medical history is useless.
Was she vaccinated? [Pause] The biological mother, when she was a baby, did she get her vaccinations?
Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months? Because before that, they are protected by their biological mother’s immune system. So, was she vaccinated?
An infant picks up a regular old measles virus. He gets a rash, he’s extremely uncomfortable, has a wicked fever, but he lives. Here’s the kicker, once every million or so times, the virus mutates. [Cut to House’s office. House and the ducklings are there] Instead of Dan having a fever and a rash the virus travels to his brain and hides like a time bomb. In this case for 16 years.
I know. There’s only been 20 cases in the United States in the past 30 years.
Boom, stage two is universally fatal.
He’s already started showing symptoms. It could be a month, it could be tonight.
Ask the neurologist.
Tap him.
So the wrong treatment kills any hope of the right diagnosis. Why do people lie to me? [Pauses and sighs] It could also kill him. Your ball, Foreman, tell me I don’t have to biopsy his brain.
It’s not an actual cost. I don’t know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing machine.
Well, tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance.
It should. If we don’t make that bet, the kid dies. If not for the paternity bet, I never would have taken their DNA, without their DNA we never would have discovered that Dan was adopted, which was the key to this case. You just don’t want to pay your end. Big mistake. My guy knows a guy.
Well now, there’s the $100 you owe me, there’s the $100 I won from Cameron, $200 I took off of Foreman, and $600 I got from Wilson. Very bitter.
Wheels, one-eight! Wheels!
Why do you want me to treat this guy?
No, no I didn’t ask how you plan to con me into treating him, I asked you why YOU want me to treat him.
There are about a billion sick people on the planet, why this one?
Ah, so it’s a proximity issue. If somebody was sick in the third floor stairwell that’s who we would be talking about.
Ok then, emergency room guy it is.
You know why.
Yeah, that’s just weird.
CBC was unremarkable, abdominal CT scan didn’t show anything. So, people, differential diagnosis. What’s wrong with her?
Him, her, does it matter? Does anyone think it is a testicular problem? No, so Chase…
Foreman, if you’re going to list all the things it’s not, it might be quicker to do it alphabetically.< Let’s see. Absidia? Excellent.< Doesn’t account for any of the symptoms.<
Well, good!< Because I thought maybe he was sick, but apparently he’s not. Who wants to do up the discharge papers? [pause]< Okay, unless we control the blood pressure, he’s going to start circling the drain before we can figure out what’s wrong with him. Treat him for sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotics and I want a cort-stim test and an echocardiogram.<
Busy case load.
So, how are we doing on cotton swabs today? If there’s an acute shortage I could run home –
Nice. [He walks over to the waiting room full of patients.] Hello, sick people and their loved ones! [Cuddy looks at him incredulously.] In the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot of boring chit-chat later, I’m Dr. Gregory House. You can call me Gregg. I’m one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.
It was?
Hmmm, that’s a shame.
Your mucus was pale goldenrod.
Oh, yes.< Very.
And yet, here you are.< What happened?< Paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call?
And you are very bad at whatever it is you do.
I know you’re going to get fired. That’s why you got the new glasses, that’s why your teeth are sparkly white.< You’re getting the most of your health insurance while you still can.
If you were quitting you would have known that last week when your snot was still pale goldenrod; you’re getting fired.
I’ll get you in for a full body scan later this week.
So, we had six symptoms that didn’t add up to anything, now we have seven.< Who’s excited?
Maybe.
You read the book.< Impressive. It’s a ludicrously long shot that explains every one of those symptoms, except for the cough and the rash. Should we just erase those?
Okay. [He grabs a colored marker.] Cardiac infection. [He circles all of the applicable symptoms, puts down the marker, and then picks up a different marker.]< Cameron, you thought… allergy? [Circle, new marker, repeat.] Chase, what was it you thought, carcinoid?< And then there’s hypothyroidism, could be parasites. Finally, sinus infection.
Cameron was right.< No condition explains all these symptoms. But orange and green covers everything.
And you think one is simpler than two.
Baby shows up.< Chase tells you that two people exchanged fluids to create this being. I tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper.< You going to go with the two or the one?
I think your tie is ugly. Why is one simpler than two?< It’s lower, lonelier… is it simpler?< Each one of these conditions is about a thousand to one shot. That means that any two of them happening at the same time is a million to one shot.< Chase says that cardiac infection is a 10 million to one shot, which makes my idea 10 times better than yours.< Get a calculator, run the numbers.
Tests take time.< Treatment’s quicker.< Start the kid on Unasyn for the sinus infection and… what was orange?
Level 4.
I know what you meant.< We’re waiting.
So you said.
Two minutes less then when you asked me two minutes ago. [Cuddy walks in.]
Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. [He closes the Gameboy.] His throat seems to have some condition.
Of course!< Yes, why didn’t I… I mean, because he said that… it hurt, and I, I should have deduced that meant it was sore…
Patients come first, right?
You once asked why I think I’m always right, and I realized that you’re right… at least, I think you’re right. I don’t really know now, do I? [Cuddy smiles.]
Excellent counsel.
No. [House walked in to the lab, unbeknownst to the other doctors.] If you look the way you do, and you say what you said, you have to be aware of the effect that it’ll have on men.
Yeah.< And dogs should stop licking themselves, it’s not gonna happen. [Chase comes in.]
Looking for you guys.
‘Cause I knew you’d be here.
No one.< I assume you’re trying to prove my crazy two-illness theory wrong, so, obviously, you’re going to be in the lab.< You spin the urine? [He pops a Vicodin.]
Talk to me when you have.
What did you find out?
I wonder if that’s signifigant.
I was sitting by his bed all morning, just so he’d know someone was there for him.
Ergo, the treatment’s working. Ergo, me right, you wrong.
Thank you.< It was either that or get my hair highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.
Flies, no.< Doctors, sure.< If I’d said to Foreman, “Nice try, it was a great guess, but not this time,” what do you think he’d be doing right now?
Exactly.
No, I don’t want him going home.
9:30, I figure she was on the 8th hole when I paged her… [he grimaces as his guy dies, and hands her the Gameboy] Probably got another half hour. [She starts to play as Foreman opens the door.]
Her leg hurts after running six miles. Who knows, it could be anything!
I am so glad you work here.
Well, that certainly would be a concern. Fifty bucks?< [Patient looks up.]< Don’t look away, the space monkeys will be all over you.
You think that’s bad luck? Do you think that God will smite him because of our insensitivity? Well, if God does, you make a quick fifty. [Patient kills the little guy on the Gameboy.]< Go check his white blood count.< If he’s fighting off a virus like you think it’ll be way up. [He starts to play on the Gameboy again. Foreman leaves, and Wilson enters.]
White cell count isn’t up, is it?
The patient could have died.
Well, those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions. I, you know, I, I’m entitled to a consult!
Oh, come on.< You’ve got a hundred other idiot doctors in this building who go warm and fuzzy every time they pull a toy car out of a nose, you don’t need me here.
When did I sign up for that course?
Working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion. [He starts to walk out.] I’ve got your home number, right? In case anything comes up at 3 o’clock in the morning.
Don’t.
No!< There is not a thin line between love and hate. There is, in fact, a Great Wall of China with armed sentries posted every 20 feet between love and hate. [to the pharmacist] 36 Vicodin.
I am.
Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician.
Well, we all have our limitations. [He grabs a bottle from the counter and turns to leave.]
What was the kid’s first symptom? [small pause] You did the history; of his 800 symptoms, which one hit him first?
Gout. [He walks back into his office; they follow.]
Because he doesn’t have gout. Every day, cells die. [CGI of… cells!] We survive because the remaining cells divide and replace the losses. The colchicine, a gout medicine, blocks mitosis and stops cell division, which will result in abdominal pain, rash, nausea, fever, kidney failure, low blood pressure, and will also mess with the bone marrow. [He crosses these all off the board.]
Because you guys were right. He didn’t have two conditions at the exact same time. First, he got a cough. Now, because he’s an idiot, he went to a doctor. In order to feel justified charging $200, the doctor felt he should actually do something.< Oops. He wrote a prescription. 7000 people die each year from pharmacy screw-ups. Not nearly as many as die from doctor screw-ups, but still, not something they use in their promotional material.< The pharmacist gave him gout medicine instead of cough medicine. And the only thing it wouldn’t do: it would do absolutely nothing to relieve his cough.< Occam’s Razor.< The simplest explanation is almost always somebody screwed up.
Okay.< Two people screwed up.< Not as simple as one, but…
I’m Dr. House.< I’m your son’s physician.<
It’s easy if you don’t give a crap about them. That’s a good thing. If emotions made you act rationally, then they wouldn’t be called emotions, would they?< That’s why we have this nice division of labor: you hold his hand, I get him better. If I start tucking him in at night, well, that’s not fair to you guys, and if you start prescribing medicine, that’s not fair to me.< So what I want to know is: who stepped on my side of the med? Who cared enough to get stupid enough to give him his cough medicine?
Tuesday, he’s getting better. Wednesday, he’s getting sick again. Somebody gave him his cough medicine Wednesday. [pause]< Come on, nobody’s gonna be mad.< I just want to know who tried to kill the kid.
Page Dr. Occam.< He’s gonna want to hear about this.<
I wish you would dare.< Where are the pills?
No, it wasn’t.< Where’s the bottle?
It was so perfect.< It was beautiful.
And triteness kicks us in the nads.
This doesn’t bother you?
I was not wrong.< Everything I said was true.< It fit. It was elegant.
Reality is almost always wrong. [takes some Vicodin] The cough medicine did something. Aggravated the condition. It’s all over the place, must be in his blood.
Lymphoma?
Well, we foolishly ruled out lymphoma because his CT scan showed no adenophathy, CBC showed a normal diffen smear, bone marrow showed no –
He has no blood pressure, no immune system and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him.
How you doing?
Great.< I’m doing good, too.< I get to knock off an hour early today.< Know why? ‘Cause I kissed my boss’ ass, you ever do that?< I think she just said yes because she wants to reinforce that behavior. Wants me to kiss a lot of other people’s ass, like she wants me to kiss yours.< [Boy makes an odd face.]< What would you want, a doctor who holds your hand while you die, or a doctor who ignores you while you get better?< I guess it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die.
You think it’s going to come out on its own? Are we talking bigger than a breadbasket? ‘Cause actually, it will come out on its own, which for small stuff is no problem. Gets wrapped up in a nice soft package and plop! Big stuff, you’re going to rip something, which speaking medically, is when the fun stops.
You’ve been here half an hour and haven’t sat down, that tells me its location.< You haven’t told me what it is, that tells me it’s humiliating. You have a little birdie carved on your arm, that tells me you have a high tolerance for humiliation, so I figure it’s not hemorrhoids. [pause] I’ve been a doctor 20 years, you’re not going to surprise me.
[has to digest this for a moment] Is it… is it because of the size, or the shape, or the pounding bass line?
[looks at his watch] I’m gonna wait.
Okay, it’s 3:00, I’m off. Would you tell Dr. Cuddy there’s a patient in Exam Room 2 that needs her attention?< And the RIAA wants her to check for illegal downloads. [chuckles at his own joke; Cameron runs up.]
Okay, well, let’s leave it a couple of weeks. He should be feeling better by then. Oh wait, which way does time go?
Pain in his fingers… right. [pops a Vicodin]
[to Mrs. Merrell] Hi again. [He enters the prep area.]
Hey!< How y’all doing?< Interesting fact: every seven years it’s a whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?
Yeah, I read the sign.< But cells of different organs reproduce at different rates. [He touches Brandon’s leg, Brandon flinches and makes noises of protest.] So, a new kidney every three years, a new stomach lining every week…. This is why colchicine poisoning causes all of these symptoms but not all at once.
Colchicine does its damage in a very specific order. First of all, there’s a pain in the abdomen, the rash, the fever… isn’t that what you got first? Then, the kidneys go, which is exactly what happened to….
Right.< Then it screws up your bone marrow, and then – neuropathy. Painful tingling in the fingers and toes. And what do you suppose happens after that? [He rips out some of Brandon’s hair. His mother doesn’t look too thrilled.] Hair loss. The bad new is: your special boy is doing drugs.
Ecstasy?
D’you know what they cut that stuff with? Apparently colchicine, unless you ingested the colchicine through your contact lens solution, or skin cream, or some other drug you’re lying about. I don’t know how it happened, I don’t care how it happened, it happened. Start….
Lovely name.< Start Brandon on fab fragments, and give him some Tylenol for the hair I pulled out. And get some air in here! [He leaves the room and walks off with Wilson.] Make a note: I should never doubt myself.
What, you don’t care about these people?
It’s not for me, I’m fully stocked.
Nope.< Trying to solve that kid’s case.
Yeah.
Well, you’d be wrong.
You know how many forms of colchicine there are on the market?
Neither do I, but it’s a lot. Pills, powders, liquids, IV fluids…. Somewhere at a party, in his coffee, up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.<
He said he used it twice.
Yeah, but if you’re gonna lie, it’s –
Not curious?
Right.
It’s amnesia.
I just came in to get milk for my coffee, which you’re out of.
Flat.
[to Wilson] Exhibit A: Baby girl Hartig. Term baby, 42 hours old. Went into seizures 6 hours ago, brought into the intensive care, diagnosed with obstruction of the small bowel. [looks at Wilson]
People don’t bug me until they get teeth. [small pause] Exhibit B: Baby boy Hausen. Another term baby, 48 hours old. Brought into the NICU before the Hartig baby: fever of unknown origin, 101 degrees, trending upwards.
Don’t touch that.
We have an infection spreading in the hospital.
They fell sick within four hours of each other. They had the same delivery rooms, maternity rooms are neighboring, so transmission’s possible. They have the same symptoms.
What does bowel obstruction on a chart indicate?
It means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the patient’s bowel is obstructed.
Look at the x-ray. It’s a normal gas pattern.
[simultaneously] Air. Air in the colon.
If it’s air, no bowel obstruction.
No. Something’s infected both these infants.
Because I’m the only one who looked at both kids. I want them isolated; I want the maternity ward shut down.
Radiologists always over-read babies’ x-rays, especially if they’re asked to rule out a pathology. He read into it what he wanted.
See, this is why I don’t waste money on shrinks, ‘cause you give me all these really great insights for free.
We have an epidemic! [Cuddy stops from going out the door and turns to House.]
How many do?
Get up! We’re going hunting.
Wabbits.
Hi. [pause] Bye. [passes the baby to Foreman, saying quietly] He’s screaming, he’s fine.
[looks at elevator] Overflow rooms, third floor. [goes into elevator]
Did he get hot all of a sudden?
No. But I am interested.
Three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms.
Yeah. That would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.
It’s worse than that. We don’t even know what’s the needle we’re looking for. [He starts to erase the whiteboard.]
Because the hospital’s her baby, and her baby’s sick. If she doesn’t solve this soon, her head’s going to explode, and I don’t want to get any on me. [Chase and Cameron snicker softly] So let’s figure out what’s in the haystack. Differential diagnosis, people.
Next?
Which leads us to bacterial infection. [which he writes on the board] It’s not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, so we’ve got something resistant. The usual suspects.
Okay, those are the big ones. Cultures will take 48 hours, might as well be post-mortem. We’ll start them on Vancomycin for the MRSA and Aztreonam for the rest. Let’s get MRIs, check for abcesses or some occult infection. I’ll be in the clinic. Grab me if you find something important. Or unimportant.
Lift up your arms. [She does so.] You have a parasite.
Lie back and lift up your sweater. [She lies back, and still has her hands up.] You can put your arms down.
Only for about a month or so. After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple of states. [He starts to ultrasound her abdomen.]
Don’t worry. Many women learn to embrace this parasite. They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites –
[shows her the ultrasound] It has your eyes. [It’s a baby!]
Well, I assume you weren’t getting your period. Maybe that should have give you an inkling.
Yeah, I know. I saw the scar on your arm.
Mm hmm. Interestingly enough, you also don’t get any periods if it isn’t working, which is why you were supposed to get regular pregnancy tests. [Jill makes a pained face.] I’m going to send a nurse in here to schedule your prenatal care. You’re due in about five months, so start planning the shower.
One-night stand?
I’ll schedule you a paternity test, too.
Does the old boyfriend look like your husband?
Then just have the kid. He’ll never know. The most successful marriages are based on lies. You’re off to a great start. [He leaves, Jill looks like she’s going to cry.]
Well, you look cheery. What’s going on?
Which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure.
There’s no point in guessing. Take one kid off Vancomycin and the other off Aztreonam.
Theraputic trial to find the cause of the infection.
We have four sick kids, at least. Who knows how many more haven’t started showing symptoms yet?
If these two have different reactions we know how to save the rest.
I guess I am.
Can I borrow a quarter?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, Slick. We didn’t all go to law school. Your advice is that I should use medical reasons to make medical decisions? Hmm, that’s not going to be as easy…
Well, Hartig sounds Jewish, so does Aztreonam, so we’ll take the Hartig kid off Vancomycin, how’s that? [pause]
Doctors experiment all the time.
Fine. I’ll get the parents’ consent.
Sorry, can’t do that. It’d be unethical for one patient to know about another patient’s treatment.
If they know, they won’t consent; that defeats the whole purpose.
[getting up from the couch] Two more babies have just become symptomatic. I defer to your legal wisdom: which takes precedence? Six dying babies or a missing consent form?
Who told you where my office was?
Ooh, I was trying to hide it.
The mono?
[catches on] Right. Yeah, I’m sorry, I sometimes forget patients, I thought you were this idiot who doesn’t know how to use birth control. [pointed look]
That’s very often the first sign. [He gets into the elevator.] Call my office in the morning, I’ll schedule him for bloodtests. [The elevator doors close.]
Chase. [pause] Time of death: 6:57 PM. [long pause] The Aztreonam doesn’t work. Double-cover all the other babies with Vancomycin.
Cameron, you tell the parents. Tell them their child probably saved five lives.
Chase is busy.
[to Wilson] Make sure she does her job.
I asked you to make sure she does her job, not do it for her.
She felt sorry for the parents so she shut up. You felt sorry for her so you opened your mouth.
Yeah, she needs to deal with it. If you hadn’t bailed her out, she would have done it.
Yeah, what is it?
Vancomycin doesn’t kill it. Aztreonam doesn’t kill it. What the hell is this?
This is our fault. Doctors over-prescribing antibiotics. Got a cold? Take some penicillin. Sniffles? No problem. Have some azithromycin. Is that not working anymore? Well, got your Levaquin. Antibacterial soaps in every bathroom. We’ll be adding Vancomycin to the water supply soon. We bred these super bugs. They’re our babies. Now they’re all grown up and they’ve got body piercings and a lot of anger. [sigh] On the other hand, maybe antibiotics had nothing to do with it. Did you notice how low his BP was at the end? Even with three pressers?
Go home. There’s nothing more you can do tonight.
Baby boy Chen-Lupino. Time of death 6:57 PM Thursday, December 2nd, 2004. [He takes the covers off of the tools and starts to remove the baby’s diaper.]
This is a cross-section of the Chen-Lupino boy’s myocardium. Fibrosis, lymphocydic infiltrates.
Yes, well, we all had plenty of good reasons to think bacterial. Nobody is scolding you. [He hands Cameron his cane.] Unfortunately, all of those clever reasons were wrong. It is a virus infecting their hearts.
Chase, you’re the intensivist. How many could we do before we risk exsanguinating the kids?
[writes “Virus” on the white board’] Okay, so we have to narrow the thousand viruses down to six. Now, the autopsy’s shown us what the virus does. So, let’s go. What do we know?
Also adenovirus. [House starts to make a T-chart on the board.] What else, what else? Keep talking.
No.
Cardiac scarring, people.
[muttering] Echo 11.
[mutters] Influ A. Yes. And? [We see more ideas being written on the board.] I’m putting RSV down as a yes. That makes eight.
Pushing it, but we love that! Get the antibody kits, start testing the sick kids.
Wait a second. The, the kids on the floor who didn’t get sick. Are any of them still in the hospital?
I want to test his blood, too.
‘Cause we need all the information we can get. The healthy kid can be our control group.
What did we get?
Great.
Three viruses?
[sighs] They’re infants. They have their mother’s blood, their mother’s antibodies.
Uh-uh. We have half the picture. The healthy kids survived because their mothers’ antibodies saved them.
And whichever they don’t have the antibodies for, that’s what’s killing their kids.
Hey, Foreman? Got a minute? [Foreman gets into the elevator.]
No news, then. How’s Cameron?
Sure. Let’s start with her, and move on to all the other Camerons we know.
I can understand how the question would surprise you. I don’t quite get how it would confuse you.
Why do you want to know why I want to know?
Me, too.
I’m the most curious man in the world.
Well, then, this must not be trivial. How is Cameron handling everything? [They’re at the doors of the clinic.]
Great, glad we talked.
Your husband is definitely the source of your “mono”.
Sometimes the best gift is the gift of never seeing you again.
No.
No.
That would be no.
They all gone?
You look tired.
It’s no wonder. You’ve had a hard time the last couple of days.
Not like you. [pause] Anyone who’s that awkward either has no experience around death or too much, and I’m pretty sure it’s not the former. [Cameron starts to put on her coat.] Chase told me about that idea you had: the parents holding the baby. Where’d you get that? Did you lose someone? Did you lose a baby?
I’m in the haystack.
Right.
Enteroviruses are spread by humans. Fecal, oral… could be respiratory secretions, though.
That won’t do it.
The shedder, whoever he is, is so virulent, Cuddy must have noticed him.
And the babies didn’t share any common personnel. That’s what’s weird.
I’m performing a delivery.
Patient whose prenatal care I’ve been handling. Just checking her out a couple of minutes ago. Of course, I’ll need one of you two guys to supervise.
Late March.
Thank God these chairs are comfortable.
We are condemned to useless labor. [House has a giant stack of charts next to him.]
Writing down what we already know to be read by nobody. Pretty sure Dante would agree that qualifies as useless.
Oops. I missed.
Could an eight-year-old do this? [He makes a face. Wilson smiles.]
Yeah, but see, see, I’m off at twelve and it’s already five of.
Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?
Hi. I’m Dr. House. What seems to be the problem?
You must be all the talk around the holy water cooler. You been washing a lot of dishes recently?
Anything new in the kitchen?
Should have spent your time saving souls, it’s easier on the hands. This is contact dermatitis; you’re allergic to dish soap.
I’ve been a doctor for years. Why do I have to keep assuring people that I know what I’m doing? A person can become allergic to substances that they’ve had repeated and prolonged exposure to. The good news is: free samples. Diphenhydramine. It’s an antihistamine. It’ll stop the allergic reaction. Take one every eight hours, it might make you feel a little sleepy. And get some of that over-the-counter cortisone cream.
You want some water? [He hands her the pills.]
Well, you just relax for a few minutes. That stuff works pretty fast. [He leaves. The other sisters help Augustine take the medication with her thermos of tea. House to the clinic main desk and throws the chart down on the pile of other ones.]
How do you solve a problem like dermatitis?
I don’t know. She’s certainly looking at me.
And you don’t? Then you’re wearing an awfully funny hat.
Lift up your chin. [He listens to her breathing.] Sister, you’re having an asthma attack. I need you to relax. [to Eucharist] Roll up her sleeve, please. [He grabs a syringe from the cabinet.] I’m giving you epinephrine, it’ll open your lungs and help you breathe. [He sticks the needle in her arm, CGI shot of the bloodstream going to her lungs, and the airways opening.]
Did she take the pill?
It’s probably an allergic reaction.
You figure somebody’s out to get her? How’re you feeling?
I’ll put you on some steroids instead.
It’s called adrenaline, it makes your heart beat fast. [He feels her pulse.] But not this fast. [to the others] Get a nurse, please. Lie back.
Somebody get in here! [A tech comes in.] Call a code and charge up a defibrillator. She’s got no pulse. [The tech runs out, House starts chest compressions.]
0.1 cc. That is the standard dose, that is what I gave her.
She must have a pre-existing heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.
I can make it up right now.
But I didn’t.
Relax, they’re not going to sue. Worse they’d do is whack my hand with a ruler.
You’re going to report me?
Uh, how ‘bout not report me?
It’s not allergic. Allergies don’t cause cardiac arrest like this. Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.
Churg-Strauss vasculitis would. Blood vessels of the heart, lungs and skin become inflamed causing the asthma, rash and heart problems. Covers all her symptoms. [They reach the diagnostic office.]
What the hell are those?
Candy canes? Are you mocking me?
Relax. It’s a joke.
Then I’d definitely suggest treatment.
[pouring coffee] Saying you wouldn’t say it was my mistake is saying it was my mistake.
I didn’t screw up. [Foreman shakes his head.] Order a chest CT and start the sister on prednisone, 40 mg. TID.
Oh, didn’t I mention? The patient’s a nun. Sister Augustine.
[thinks a little] Who doesn’t?
If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty.
Oh, here we go. Lesson time. I recognize that confidence is not my short suit. I also recognize that I am human and capable of error.
No.
Good point. Maybe there isn’t one. Maybe that’s my error.
Most people don’t like to listen, so what’s wrong with you? [He leaves Wilson standing in the clinic.]
Let me guess… inflammatory bowel.
Yes. It’s also written on your chart. Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain… took sulfasalazine, but it didn’t work –
Next tried steroid enemas, oral corticosteroids, 5ASAs, 6 mercaptopurine… I’m impressed.
By how well your last doctor charted.
Not likely. I’m giving you a prescription. It’s cheap, which is good because your insurance company won’t pay for it. [He gives Santa a prescription, who puts on his glasses to read it.]
Cigarettes. One twice a day, no more, no less. Studies have shown that cigarette smoking is one of the most effective ways to control inflammatory bowel, plus it’s been established that you look 30% cooler.
About the looking cooler, yeah. The rest is true.
Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe are addictive and dangerous. The difference with this one is that it’s completely legal. [He turns to leave.] Merry Christmas.
So what’s that tell us?
Yeah, but… hey. I’m think that’s a trick question.
In ten seconds I’m gonna announce that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.
Unless you leave the room. If you stay you’ll have to testify. [Cuddy stays put.] Five, four, three, two…. So, there I was in the clinic, drunk. I open the drawer, close my eyes, take the first syringe I can find – [the ducklings smile, Cuddy leaves] So, what are the options for compromised immune system?
On the other hand, it explains the symptoms. Swollen hands, pulmonary problems, cardiac problems – it all fits.
So redraw the blood.
Then we’ll treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesn’t suppress it. Hyperbaric oxygen chamber.
Oh, you people. Always with the protocols. [small pause] Prep the nun and discontinue the prednisone. [He begins to erase the whiteboard and continues to talk to Foreman as the others leave.] I am both amused and annoyed that you think I should be less stubborn than you are.
The one that starts: First, do no harm, then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions, and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone. Yeah, took a read once, wasn’t impressed.
Every treatment has its dangers –
I’m convinced. You’re not. Question is, what are you going to do about it? Hmm?
House of prayer, huh. That explains the good reception. Also why nobody’s ever here.
I thought that was a job requirement for you people.
[turns off TV] So, you’re warning me that I may be treating a non-existent ailment
That must make you angry. [eats a piece of chocolate]
[offers the chocolate] Want some?
I guess you’ve got to be good at reading people to be a good infirmarian, huh.
So, we’ve got pride, anger, envy, gluttony…. That’s four out of seven deadly sins in two minutes. Do you people keep records of these things? Is there a Cathlympics?
They like to talk.
Yeah, that’s pretty stupid.
And when things go wrong, I get hurt. I’m not tough, I’m vulnerable.
You know, from the way you’re looking at me right now, I’d say you just hit number five: lust. [Eucharist hands House his candy bar and leaves. House pulls out his pocket TV.]
Well, thanks for checking up on her. Good to know you’ve got my back.
Irritation from the oxygen is typical.
That well just never runs dry, does it? If there was no underlying problem, then why is she still having the rapid heartrate?
Her reaction is a symptom, not an error.
Yes, there is! And if this one doesn’t work will find another.
One that fits all the facts. Look, we obviously have a difference of opinion, and that’s fine, but unfortunately I’ve used up all the time I’ve budgeted today for banging my head against a wall.
Came for my stethoscope.
Okay, yeah. I’d like to clear my reputation.
[leaving the exam room] You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and not for lung cancer?
It’s because people blame lung cancer patients. They smoked, they screwed up, they deserve to die. The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt. [He enters Cuddy’s office where the records are kept.]
You said that with great significance.
I’m here because, if I’m right, Cuddy is killing that patient.
Then she’s saving her.
But she’s always with you in spirit. What do you know about the nun?
The cute one. I think she likes me. The sick one, obviously.
What’s she lying about?
I always say that. And the old nun says the sick nun is a big fat nun liar. You know nuns, what do you think?
You hate nuns. You can’t hate someone if you don’t know them.
I have a theory on what makes good boys “good”. It’s not because of some moral imperative. Good boys have the fear of God put into them. Catholic Church specializes in that kind of training, to make good boys afraid of divine retribution so they will do what their daddies tell them, like, for example, going into medical school when it’s the last thing they want to do. What do you think?
Did you paint, or put in new carpets recently?
Any way she could have got access to drugs?
I’ve found that when you want to know the truth about someone that someone is probably the last person you should ask.
She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly. If I were you I’d have her repeat a year of nun school. [Nun chuckles.]
Becoming a doctor doesn’t make you a healer.
So, what is the sick one’s drama?
Sure. Do all of you lie? It’s a good strategy, simpler when you all tell the same lie, but she has not spent her entire life as a good Catholic. When she had a cardiac arrest I had to open her blouse to do CPR and I learned two things: nuns can have nice breasts, and she has a tattoo on her shoulder of a skunk. Now, maybe it’s the Sacred Skunk of Joseph, but as far as I know, Catholic foster care and monasteries do not keep tattoo parlors in their refractories.
Is irrelevant to you, but it’s relevant to me.
It’s not. [He takes a sip of tea, then looks at it.] This tea is delicious. Local herbs?
“I’m going to do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another. I’m gonna stop you from killing your patient.” It’s figwort tea. Great for that little pick-me-up we’re all looking for in the morning. Opens the lungs, increases the blood pressure, stimulates the heart. Unfortunately, if you then get injected with even 0.1 cc of epinephrine: instant cardiac arrest. Still, what the hell, it tastes great.
Has been drinking it religiously, so to speak.
All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a severe long-term allergic reaction.
Yes, she did. Well done. [Cameron smiles.] But your unwillingness to stick by your diagnosis almost killed this woman. [No more smiles.] Take a lesson from Foreman: stand up for what you believe. Okay, let’s go figure out how to save a nun. [He leaves.]
Because it’s been untreated for so long, it’s gone from a simple watery eyes, scratchy throat allergy to a whopping I’m-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy, compromising her immune system, diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organs systems. So, what’s the source?
No, symptoms persisted days after the dishwashing episode. It’s gotta be something she’s been exposed to here in the hospital as well as the monastery.
Could be, but it’s not definitive.
Okay. And we’ll gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds. When she reacts to something we’ll know that’s what killing her.
How do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room?
Checked that.
Checked that. Checked everything.
It’s not my will. [takes a couple of Vicodin]
What do you want me to do? Accept it, pack it in?
No, they don’t. We just don’t know the reason.
I don’t need verification from you to know that I’m doing my job well. That’s your problem, not mine.
Yeah, well, you don’t need to always do that. [pause]
Good.
Well, talk her out of it.
Room’s paid up for the rest of the week. You might as well stick around.
Does anybody believe anything you say? You’re not accepting. You’re running away. Just like you always do. You ran away from the monastery, you get laid, you ran away from the real world when getting laid didn’t work out so good. Now things aren’t working out again, so off you go.
What I have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief. Faith isn’t based on logic and experience.
Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby? Hmmm? And watching her mother abandon her because she needs another score. The miracle of love. You’re twice as likely to be killed by the person you love than by a stranger.
You can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife, and heaven and hell, but when it comes to this world, don’t be an idiot. ‘Cause you can tell me you put your faith in God to put you through the day, but when it comes time to cross the road, I know you look both ways.
Then you might as well live. You’ve got a better shot betting on me than on Him.
She has God inside her. It would have been easier to deal with a tumor.
We looked everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction except one place: inside her.
She had one.
She didn’t have it at a hospital. Order a full body scan.
Tell her I’m looking for a miracle.
The copper cross, a form of birth control pulled off the market in the 80s.
Rare, but it happens.
She had an abortion. IUD must have been left in, embedded in the endometrial tissue where it couldn’t be detected.
Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose and all the tissues are soggy.
Nope, seventh is –
I think we both know the flaw in that theory.
Kidneys functioning, heart rate is normal. You know how it is with nuns: you take out their IUDs and they bounce right back.
Told you I didn’t screw up.
I gave her 0.1 cc of epinephrine.
You’re Jewish.
No thanks.
Your wife doesn’t mind being alone at Christmas?
[quickly] Neither do I. [Cuddy enters.]
Thank you.
Depends what you mean by “good.” I like these chairs. [ back to paper ]
[rattling paper] Of COURSE it’s the alcohol. [Both turn to look at him] Hello! [House gets up and walks over to them] This guy’s a professional doctor. Plays golf and everything, I bet. He’s not gonna tell you your mom’s an alcoholic without proof. I’m sure he scoped for varices , checked her esophagus, ran all kinds of blood tests. Doctors like this, they don’t make assumptions, they do the work!
What case? It’s over. You’re sending her home. [ to Luke ] How old is she?
Own my own stethoscope. Did I ask you how old she was? I forget.
Thirty eight year old woman with no previous symptoms or history presents with deep vein thrombosis -- how did she get it?
Fine. You’re all sleeping. You need a clue. [ circles “38yo” on whiteboard ] She’s 38 years old! She’s 20 years too young to get a deep vein thrombosis!
There was no trauma, none of the risk factors.
I… have some notes. They’re not mine, but they’re reliable, I think, for purposes of this discussion. As for the immobility, well, she’s real active right now, of course – paranoia keeps her limber.
Oh yeah – she’s schizophrenic. And her kid wrote this [ hefting notebook ], so it might be a little biased. Having to take care of his nutso mom and all. You think there’s a connection? Do we include schizophrenia in the differential for DVT?
The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots. Schizophrenia is not the cause of DVT.
On the other hand, we don’t really know anything about schizophrenia, so maybe it is connected.
Thanks. I’m more of a Leroy Neiman man. And it is only about the DVT. She’s 38 years old, she should be…
We don’t even know how to treat it! Come on! Fumigation of the vagina?
Two thousand years ago, that’s how Galen treated schizophrenics – the Marcus Welby of ancient Greece.
I’m interested. I’m interested in how voices in the head could be caused by malposition of the uterus.
And now what have we got? We’ve got lobotomies, rubber rooms, electric shock – my – Galen was so primitive.
Going to see the patient. That all-important human connection. Thought I’d give it a whirl.
If it wasn’t for Socrates, that raving untreated schizophrenic, we wouldn’t have the Socratic method – the best way of teaching everything, apart from juggling chainsaws. Without Isaac Newton, we’d be floating on the ceiling.
And that guitar player in that English band – he was great. [ stopping at Lucy’s room ] You think I’m interested because of the schizophrenia.
Galen was pretty sure about the fumigation thing. [ sliding door open and closed ] Pink Floyd.
Gregory House – nice to meet you. [ to Luke ] Be all right if we spoke alone for awhile?
[ hefting notes ] Got your case notes… doctor. There’s a cafeteria downstairs. [ holding out bill ] Get yourself whatever you want as long as there’s enough left over for a reuben sandwich, dry, no fries, hold the pickles. Should run you about $5.80 with tax. [ Luke takes money; House pulls pager off his belt and hands it to the kid ] I’ll page you when we’re done. [ Luke leaves; House goes over and sits at Lucy’s bedside ]
Nice kid. How much do you really drink?
And the meds…
Very nice.
Not “Mets” – meds – medicine. You take what he tells you to take.
I do.
You told Luke it never hurt before.
Didn’t?
Yeah. The Mets suck. Also, for the last two months, she hasn’t shaved her legs. Because of the tremors… she cuts herself.
Exactly. Something changed in the last two months. I’m thinking the amount of blood when she cut herself. So let’s start with some bloodwork. Collect and send for clotting studies, PT, PTT, factor 5, protein C&S, the whole shebang.
Everyone, this is Luke.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, save it, we’re busy. Luke, give us another half hour with your mom. We need to do some tests. [ Luke walks away ] Nice kid. Take her off the psych meds, that way we’ll know what’s what on the physical side, and who knows, we might get more out of her. [ guys walk away, House is opening up the wrapper, munching into the sandwich; Cameron is hanging back with him ] Don’t worry – no pickles.
[ chewing ] OK… whose?
Oh.
[ entering exam room ] Well, good news, the lab says it’s not strep, so we’re done.
No, really, not strep. Boys in the lab, sure, they’re hard drinkers, but they’re pros, you know. Plus, your kid actually has none of the symptoms of strep, I just figured it was quicker running the test than arguing with you. My point is – go!
This is why you’re here.
You want a doctor to scare her about the dangers of sugar.
[ closes door ] Well, you know… [ comes over to girl ] I feel sorry for those other kids, Wendy, who don’t have a mom like yours – a mom who knows that sugar causes heart disease, appendicitis, and athlete’s foot.
Oh, yes it is. No, I get it. You want her to slim down a little, so she can wear pretty clothes like yours. Love the bracelets. Hey! What about matching outfits? You could be twins! She can’t be your daughter, it’s impossible, you look way too young! [ leaving ] Happy birthday. Get the kid a damned ice cream cake.
Actually, I didn’t. I’ve taken her off all medications.
We needed blood for some tests. I assume that was the only way to get it.
Look – I have a cane, and I know how to use it.
OK, can I go now? Boss? [ walks away ]
So, when I said, “no psych meds,” I’m just curious – which word didn’t you understand?
Oh, great, well, that’s good to hear. So she won’t experience any of those pesky little side effects you get when your motives AREN’T pure.
Passing out, increased confusion, depression, that’s not gonna happen. That’s not gonna screw up our diagnosis, ‘cause you just used it to restrain her. I’m so relieved!
It must have been so frightening for you.
Yeah! Anything but give her drugs – that’s basically my point!
It turns out your best judgment is not good enough. Here’s an idea – next time, use mine.
Why did the patient bleed out?
Well, cover your ears if you don’t want me to spoil the ending. Everything was normal, except for prolonged PT time, which means what?
Oh, that’s right – ‘cause… you drew the blood. But you were precise, because you knew the tube was purely for the PT study.
And I’m right with you. I trust this result. For two reasons, a) because you are a good doctor, and b) because five milligrams of IV Haldol makes for a spectacularly cooperative patient. The prolonged PT time makes me think she’s got a vitamin K deficiency.
Without vitamin K, protein C doesn’t work. Without protein C, she clots. Clotting and thinning, all at the same time.
Clever, but she’s not on ampicillin.
Which she refused to take.
Gee, I wish my idea was as cool and with it as yours. What is yours, by the way? Do you have one?
Three theories. Check out her place for ampicillin and diet, then ultrasound her liver. Let’s find out who’s right before she bleeds to death.
Ah. Problem is, you can’t actually live on this stuff.
Yeah, vitamin A and C, but no K. That’s why your mom got sick.
Load her up with vitamin K.
If it all checks out, you can take her home in a couple of days. Oh God, you’re upset about something. You’re gonna open to me now, aren’t you?
Here we go…. OK, I’m gonna say this once. You have done a very good job taking care of your mother. If this was all she’d eat, then what else could you do? Gosh, just being a kid is a full-time job…
Good example, just the time it takes to express those ridiculous self-centered teenage ideas… I don’t envy your schedule. [ chomps ] No pickles.
Smart woman.
You should get that looked at.
[ putting up x-ray on lightbox ] It’s not broken. [ pointing ] See this right here? It’s the epiphyseal plate, otherwise known as the growth plate.
Amazing thing, this bone. If you know how to read it, it can tell you how old someone really is, exactly how old.
Not even fifteen. Almost, though. Two weeks away, maybe a month.
[ walking over to his desk and sitting down ] Happy birthday to both of us. If you’re gonna lie though, go big, go 21. That way you won’t need your crazy mom to help you buy vodka.
I suppose your biggest worry isn’t the booze. You’re 15, basically no mom. Child Welfare let kids get away with that, well, they wouldn’t need those nice foster homes, and that would make them sad.
Not the word I’d use. Most 15 year old kids are doing what they’re supposed to be doing, you know, they’re huffing glue, catching crabs…
Oh, relax. It’s not even your x-ray.
[Sarcastically] That’s gonna happen.
She’s a schizophrenic mother, with no money, on the public dole, in fact, who knocks back vodka every time a breeze blows her way.
Yeah, well, Lucy can’t switch-hit. Plan B. Surgery to resect the tumor.
Would he do it at 4.6?
This one does.
Good morning, Dr. Cuddy! Love that outfit. Says, I’m professional, but I’m still a woman. Actually, it sorta yells the second part.
Gotta go. [ walks away ] Those running noses aren’t just gonna start walking on their own.
[ stops ] How long? Maybe we could catch a movie.
I don’t believe it. Who came running to Mommy?
[ realizes she’s bluffing ] You have no idea what I’m talking about.
It’s Cameron. She… found out about my birthday. I thought she told you, and
Oops. [ walks away; Cuddy walks over and picks up phone ]
Um hmm. [ reading from chart ] Pulling the tongue, icepacks on the throat, hitting yourself… the groin pinch. Well, you’ve certainly covered all the normal medical bases. Uh, how are you hitting yourself, though? Is it open hand or fist?
Well, that’s how they teach it at Harvard Med. How hard though?
I’m sorry, I missed that. Could… could you do that again? [ patient slaps himself again ] That’s… that’s very good. [ to Cuddy ] Hiccups.
Mmhhmmm, I need to go peepee. [ to patient ] Dial it up a notch and repeat. I’ll be back. [ he leaves, Cuddy follows, patient slaps himself again ]
Ooh, girl in the boys’ bathroom. Very dramatic. Must be very important what you have to say to me. [ dries hands and face on paper towel ]
At a guess, I’d say “Dr. House must be really really good – why am I wasting him on hiccups?” I wash before and after. [ walks over to urinal ]
[ over his shoulder ] Do me a favor…?
I was gonna say “leave,” but that works.
Only way to get the guy to do the surgery…
I know – to save lives. Specifically doctors’ lives, and not just their lives but their lifestyles. Wouldn’t wanna operate on anyone really sick – they might die and spoil our stats.
True. I got all focused on her right to live, and forgot. You do what you think is right.
No. I didn’t. And frankly I’m angry. Which I’m guessing is the correct response. ‘Course I’ll know better once you tell me what you’re talking about.
Oh. Anger was a bad guess. Well, normally I’d put on a festive hat and celebrate the fact that the earth has circled the sun one more time. I really didn’t think it was gonna make it this year, but darnit, if it wasn’t the Little Planet That Could all over again.
Why are you here? To buy me a pony?
Yeah well, go scrub in.
Not a word. Some kind of mind game. She’s waiting for me to crack.
Yeah, well… [ Luke storms past them, followed by Child Services reps ]
[ staring after them ] Yeah. I get that a lot. I don’t think Mom’s crazy.
[ reading to Lucy ] “For in the old days, though she had young men’s praise and old men’s blame, among the poor, both old and young gave her praise.” [ he snaps the book shut and she wakes up ]
You called Social Services. It was you.
It’s OK, it’s OK, I get it. He’ll have an easier time dealing with the system. Sure, he won’t be with his real mother, but his real mother’s sick. Someone needs to take care of him.
What would his future have been? Taking you to chemo and back on the bus… and even if the cancer’s in complete remission, he’ll still have a mother who hears voices.
“Look what I do to him, limpie.” You said that. I checked the phone records – only one call from this room. Smart – they charge you two bucks a call. It was to Social Services of the State of New Jersey. You’re his mother, couldn’t do it to him anymore. [ pause ] Good for you.
On the small stuff, yeah, when to sleep, what to drink, no lemonade but I’ll take some hemlock if you’ve got it.
But giving up your son, because it’s better for him – it’s so sane, so rational. Self-sacrifice is not a symptom of schizophrenia… it excludes the diagnosis.
She’s 36 years old when she first presents…
The internist sends her to a shrink, one shrink sends her to the next, she tells them all she’s not crazy, the drugs don’t work and why would they if she’s not a head case? She got clearer when I took her off the psych meds. [ pauses at his office door ] You think I’M crazy.
I like to walk.
[ picking up telephone ] Is that Dr. Jeffrey Walters? Hi. My name is Greg House, I’m a doctor… oh, is that the time? Yeah, I’m sorry, my watch must have stopped. Listen, you treated a patient about eighteen months ago, a woman named Lucille Palmeiro, I wondered if you recalled running any tests… [ fades as Walters hangs up on him ] …at all. [ tries again, using a terrible English accent! ] Oh, how terribly foolish of me, doctor, is it that late? Yes, I’m calling from London, you see, must have got my times mixed up so… [ another hangup ]
I have a headache. It’s my only symptom. I go to see three doctors. The neurologist tells me it’s an aneurysm, the immunologist says I got hay fever, the intensivist… can’t be bothered, sends me to a shrink, who tells me that I’m punishing myself ‘cause I wanna sleep with my mommy.
Pick your specialist, you pick your disease. If it’s not schizophrenia, what else presents with psych symptoms?
Very rare. Nice. I like it.
Well, that’s funny, I thought I encouraged you to question…
July 17, an appointment with a Dr. Carne.
Carne is not a shrink. I looked him up, he’s an ophthalmologist. Now why would she want her eyes checked?
Yes, it does. It also causes slight cirrhosis, which Dr. Chase so eagerly attributed to alcohol. [ looks at them all ] So what are we still doing here???
Lucy! [ she snaps awake ] I don’t think you’re crazy.
Come on. [ they get her up, move an eye scope around to the side of her bed ]
It’s what I’d do.
That’s OK, we’re just here for the music.
I heard a rumor.
Really?
Yes. You’re welcome.
Look. I don’t care how you were living. I just wanted you out of MY life. That’s why I had Dr. Cuddy call Social Services.
You were right. It wasn’t the DVT. It was the schizophrenia.
She’s not nearly as interesting any more.
Clinical depression. Incredibly contagious. Every time I’m around one of them I get blue.
Great, you got it all figured out. You don’t need me.
Well maybe if above mentioned doctors were interested in my opinion they would have asked for it.
No pain no gain. [gets in the elevator]
Huh.
Husband described her as being unusually irritable recently.
I didn't know it was possible for a woman to be "unusually" irritable. [elevator dings, they get off]
What’s the first thing you ask a doctor who’s referring a patient?
Not “what?”. “Why?”
No, but doctors do. Why this patient, what interests you? Give me the chart.
I find your interest interesting.
True, but not relevant. She’s not depressed.
Fever. Clinical depression does not cause fever.
She’s sick! Dammit, why didn’t I think of that?
Not the spleen. Thank goodness we hired a neurologist! Brain symptoms… hmm, could this be a brain problem?
Very good.
Has to be a tumor then.
Partridge in a pear tree missed it too. Redo the blood work and get a new MRI with 2 millimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic. [leaves the office, calls out as he leaves] And check for evil stepmothers. This much sleep usually indicates poisoned apples.
Anything else beside the shortness of breath?
You smoke?
Exercise?
Sounds fun. Any history of heart disease in your family?
[pulls out a stethoscope] Take a deep breath. Been under a lot of stress lately?
You’re probably just a little anemic, but I’m going to do an EKG just to make sure.
No, you can just pull that down in front. [she does so. He turns around to see that she is very well-endowed] Good. Lord. Are those real?
They look… pretty damn good.
That's so sweet. I’m afraid the cause of your problem could be staring us right in the face. Actually I guess I’m the one doing the staring. Of course I can’t be sure, I’d like to consult a colleague. He’s actually somewhat of an expert in these matters. [picks up the phone] Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?
Is a lie a lie if everybody knows it’s a lie?
Lie number one, she did not do that for her husband, she did that for herself. She thinks if she looks different, she'll be different.
Not to her husband. Cosmetic surgery is so that everyone else will look at us differently. Same reason you're wearing that tie.
Last three months, same five ties. Thursday should be that paisley thing.
No its not. Julie hates green. You bought that yourself. You want to look pretty. At work. [singsong] Wilson's got a girlfriend…
I want an EKG and blood tests including tox screen on Mrs.… Exam Room 1.
Very tricky case. [to Wilson] You love everybody. That’s your pathology.
Yes, that’s how a responsible doctor would waste his time in the situation.
A glioma not presenting on a contrast MRI would have to be smaller than a grain of sand, which does not a gravely ill person make.
Does the husband care about her?
Now way… it also means she doesn’t have Lyme Disease.
Lyme Disease initially presents with a rash. Mr. Clingy would have noticed.
Pff. Men.
She have any family history of breast cancer?
[to Foreman] The brain, but not the brain. Clever, huh?
No tumor?
You don’t. Those twelve percent, no treatment. They were too busy looking for the tumor, right till they put the patient in the ground.
Treat the symptoms. IV Immunoglobulin
Eventually it'll get bigger. Then it'll be really easy to find. One of you needs to check out where she works.
Cause the husband's not sick.
Foreman, you do it.
It’s what I do… has it gotten worse lately?
Really. Well that rules out the race thing. Cause you were just as black last week.
You gave sedatives to a patient who’s already sleeping 18 hours a day?
Where’s Wilson?
There is a simple explanation. Maybe she really has bugs under her skin.
That’s what the worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest.
If a patient throws up on your shoes do you clean up "most" of it?
In the final stage of African Trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain. It's possible they wouldn't show on smears.
I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.
Or I'm just saying she could have got it from a transfusion.
[glares at her] Okay…
We rejected Lyme Disease because the couple would have noticed a rash, but a wet hacking cough is just going to slip right by?
Two lousy ideas. Unfortunately they're better than all the other ideas. Tularemia. Bizarre. Very nice. That’s why I ride you. [goes into his own office, turns on the TV]
Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia?
Probably inconclusive, but worth doing. So what's her name? When do I get to meet her?
Your lips say no, your shoes say yes.
Solid, yet stylish. A professional woman would be impressed. I'm thinking accountant, actuary, maybe. It's somebody in the hospital. Patient? No, chemo's not sexy. Daughter of the patient? She would certainly have the neediness you need.
Very ethical. Of course, most married men would say they don’t date at all.
Perfect.
You always do. It's part of your charm.
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.
[to Wilson] She's all upset because we paid more attention to the other girl. You check out her ass, I've got the chest.
[to Wilson] You check her EKG results before she left the other day?
You're the responsible one.
[to Cuddy] Where is she?
I was right.
Surprisingly, no. But your EKG shows a slightly decreased heart rate.
You told me you hadn’t changed your diet or exercise, were you lying?
Does your husband have high blood pressure?
Yeah.. see, if you’re gonna repeat everything I say this conversation is gonna take twice as long.
He do a lot of cooking at home?
Did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately?
That it looks like your husband stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with brown sugar.
No, nothing like that. He just doesn’t want to have sex with you. [Mrs. Campbell looks stunned] Decreased sex drive is one of the most common side effects of the beta blockers he's been taking. I’m guessing he figured if you're both frigid, no harm no foul. You should have gotten him the sweater.
Fine. But if you’re still concerned about the shortness of breath, I’d start making your own breakfast. [opens the door to leave]
Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing: buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find… [seems to realize something] Huh. [leaves]
Lab tests inconclusive?
No. Too bad. Luckily, I have the answer. [pause]
Thanks for asking. The life itself. Sex. Anything that can be transmitted via the blood can be transmitted through sex.
It’s not without precedent.
A Portuguese man was diagnosed three years ago with CNS affected sleeping sickness. His only connection with Africa was through a girlfriend who served under the military in Angola.
The Journal de Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical. You don't read Portuguese?
I’m pretty sure that’s what it said. Either that or it was an ad for sunglasses.
Ooh, stymied again. Your logic is bulletproof.
Because?
Because?
Or?
[to Cameron] Find out which it is.
No, I want you to be polite and let her die. [Cameron gives him a look] Actually, I don't want you to ask her anything. Foreman take the husband, Chase take the wife.
We all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear.
Did you know she’s been trying to get pregnant?
After you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago I figured that was your thing. But you've never been prescribed folic acid, and you can't lose a baby if you’ve never been pregnant.
You coughed the other day, I was concerned.
To-MAY-to, to-MAH-to…
Alright then. They say no cheating, we cross off sleeping sickness. Any new ideas? Ok, we go with Foreman's Tularemia. Start her on IV-Chloramphenicol 25 milligrams per kilogram four times a day. Good night. [leaves]
There's only one way a Tularemia patient goes into a coma while on IV-Chloramphenicol.
And then there was one. Patient comes in because she's sleeping too much. It takes ten doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.
Well, the obvious explanation?
Does seem unlikely… Go away. [he enters Elise’s room]
[lifts Elise's arms, drops them]
Checking for lymphadenopathy. And waiting for you.
I’m Dr. House. Your wife has human African Trypanosomiasis. [Ed looks puzzled] Sleeping sickness.
Nope.
I believe you.
The treatment for this disease is a drug that’s… fatal on its own ten percent of the time. [Ed looks rather scared] Which is why I need your written consent before I can legally prescribe it.
I don’t ask why patients lie, I just assume they all do.
To protect you, because she didn’t think it mattered. It just seemed easier because… that’s what people do. Now, If you're absolutely certain that your wife has never had sex with anyone but you since you've been married, then I’m wrong. But if you think there’s a possibility that just one time she wasn’t perfect… one weekend you’re out of town… one fight when she ran to a friend, one stupid Christmas party… then you need to allow me to start treatment. Because if we don’t… she’s gonna be dead by tomorrow morning. [Ed thinks it over] Do you trust your wife that much?
I’ll start the treatment.
And you do?
And you need to tell me that?
I believe you. What I don’t believe is that it’ll be just once.
You certainly love saying it. [Wilson laughs in a very annoyed way] I’m sorry. I know you love your wife. You loved all your wives. Probably still do. In fact, you probably still love all the women you ever loved who weren’t your wives. [They stop just outside the lab]
Yeah. And you’re the good guy.
As long as you’re trying to be good, you can do whatever you want.
So between us, we can do anything. We can rule the world!
Mixing up some margaritas? Mines a double, Senorita. That’s Portuguese, you know.
Uh-oh. What’s going on?
Turn around. [She does, she looks very sad indeed.] It’s a very sad thing, an un-calibrated centrifuge. It makes me cry too.
Ok. [long pause]
Why?
At that age the chances of a marriage lasting--
I'm sorry... But that’s not the whole story. It’s a symptom, not your illness. Thyroid cancer would have been diagnosed at least a year before his death, you knew he was dying when you married him. Must have been when you first met him. And you married him anyway. You can't be that good a person and well adjusted.
Because you wind up crying over centrifuges.
Blood pressure?
You give her dopamine?
We would have expected your wife’s condition to show some improvement by now, but it hasn’t. It’s going the other way.
I need to know who you had the affair with. He has to be notified so he can get treatment as well. [pause] Why did you lie to us? You knew your life was at stake.
We all make mistakes, and we all pay a price. [pause, Elise sniffles] I need that name.
That’s the way calculus presents.
You know the kid?
Mom real good looking?
Then it’s a mystery. Not why he's sick, but why you care so much. The gift shop’s open, buy him a card.
Boys love fart jokes. Find him one with a good fart joke. [Pops a Vicodin] He’s a teenager. It’s drugs. Tell those ER geniuses to give him charcoal and naloxone so you’ll stop following me.
You don’t care about the kid. You just find his illness “intriguing”.
And you don’t care about him.
Me neither. [about the notes] Means we’ll be objective
Wouldn’t account for the bradycardia.
Wouldn’t account for the whacked out. So, what’s the differential for the negative tox screen?
That never happens.
Copy machine toner. Same punch as GHB. A little pricier, way more dangerous. On the other hand, it is legal. [To Foreman] I want you to go to his house and find his stash. Betcha know all the good hiding spots.
[to Cameron] Better go with him, in case he gets high. [to Chase] How much atropine is the kid getting?
Make it 2. In case he needs his heart later on.
I am extremely disappointed. I send you out for exciting new designer drugs and you come back with tomato sauce. [To Foreman about his shoes] Betcha paid twice as much, I got mine online.
I’m not sure about gastroenteritis but mental confusion? Bring it on! [Eats some of the sauce]
[Pulls a face] Delicious.
.I notice he didn’t try to save me
I was. Kid just started seizing. Not a symptom of food-born toxins.
So what would make him seize… in addition to all his other delightful symptoms.
Or organophosphates. Organochlorines.
Already told the nurses.
That’s your complaint? You major symptom?
And you figure that enjoying cute butts is a sign of disease?
Aha.
People are always mixing us up.
No! No… that won’t be necessary.
But I am going to admit you to the hospital for tests.
And you're just insufferable. Your mother has had a sudden personality change, she should be checked out. I’ll have a nurse come to admit her. I’m too handsome to do paperwork.
Oh, damnit you caught me. Went with the weak stuff, just trying to save a little money.
Excellent, I’m sure. It’s the US army, “be all you can be”. The point is, what are the kid’s chances without it?
I assume “minimal at best” is your stiff upper lip British way of saying “no chance in hell”?
You put the Queen on your money. You’re British. - [To Foreman] Call your professor.
By the time they get here we better know which one we need.
Well, the mom had homemade tomato sauce. Call me crazy, but I’m thinking maybe… homemade tomatoes?
Kid’s out there spraying, pretty girl walks by… hormones raging… spray can goes off in his face...
I’ll have lunch.
Psych ward’s upstairs.
What can I say, chicks with no teeth turn me on.
And that’s ageism.
Impressive. [phone rings]
Okay, I’ll get Chase on it.
Get a court order. Unless you want to see someone killed by sheer irrationality.
Actually… that’s the definition.
She’s risking her son’s life based on a teenager’s claim that he washed something. How mentally incompetent can you get?
Listen, have your Harvard law dog whip up some high-grade, legal-sounding psycho babble. “Temporary insanity brought on by acute panic distress syndrome,” I don’t care. We have to give him the hydrolase.
Not the kid, let’s ask him. Oh, I forgot we can’t. He’s dying.
[to nurse] Goodbye. [To Ms. Davis from the paper] “I, Margo Davis have been informed of the risks which may arise from my refusal of advised medical care. I here by release-”
I work for hospital. “–the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, its employees agents, and otherwise from any adverse medical conditions resulting from my refusal. It is not the hospital’s fault if my son kicks off.”
I punched up the language; mostly for clarification. “I understand my doctors consider my decision to be completely idiotic-”
“-but I am convinced that I know more than they do. I took a biology course in high school, so… yeah. Besides, I enjoy controlling every single aspect of my son’s life, even if it means his death.” Sign here please. I brought a pen.
I’m the doctor who’s trying to save your son. You’re the mom who’s letting him die. Clarification. It’s a beautiful thing.
She rethought her position. Start him on the hydrolase.
Matt’s next-door neighbor, by any chance?
How much are you giving him?
Make it ninety.
What the heck? Do it anyway. He’s a calculus student, he probably likes having a brain… I’ll have Foreman do it.
Yeah, but the mom wants to get rid of you. And you know me, I’m a people-pleasing kind of guy.
She went to the principal. Told Cuddy you did drugs in high school. This is gonna go on your permanent record.
She also used the word “slacker”. Want to come in, smoke a little weed, watch some MTV? [Enters office. Chase isn’t far behind. Cameron is waiting for them]
You sure Chi didn’t sneak out of Matt’s tomato patch? Maybe they sniffed disulfoton together to get high.
They managed to get poisoned together; they must have something in common.
How do they get to school?
Could you step outside a minute?
Because you irritate me.
Fine. Mrs. Adams, have you had any recent sexual activity?
Because you have tested positive for syphilis.
I don’t think it’s the first time Mom’s heard this diagnosis.
When did you get it?
Which suppressed it. In your case, for 60 years. But now it’s back, and the spirochetes that cause syphilis are eating away at your brain cells.
It’s not as revolting as Chlamydia; that’s got seepage. And it’s the 21st century. We've got flying cars, talking dogs, and penicillin. High-dose regimen for two weeks, you're cured.
Yeah, well, pinch yourself.
You’ll be fine. Just feed that cranky kid.
Do you have the hydrolase for ethyl parathion?
You’re getting good at this God-like doctor thing. Why don’t you talk her out of it?
Only one man left in the bullpen and he throws like a girl.
Give her the high hard one.
I guess Matt’s mom won’t nominate us for any Doctor of the Year awards.
Except their symptoms. Given their severity, in fact their cardiac symptoms are getting worse much faster than all their other ones, what does that tell us?
They were admitted at 8:45 and 11:00. When were they poisoned?
So, Matt was poisoned before 7:15. Before he got on the bus.
What do teenage boys do in the morning? Besides the obvious?
Do they use the same acne cream?
Could be contaminated. Shaving cream?
He sweats.
These people have pets?
Ok. Go to their houses, check for anything that could have touched their skin between the time they got up and the time they got on the bus. And I’m running low on tomato sauce.
I sent you home.
I’m sorry, but the fact that the sexual pleasure center of your cerebral cortex has been over-stimulated by spirochetes is a poor basis for a relationship. Learned that one the hard way.
Yes.
No, but it’ll kill you.
Do you think I would have given you this if it would stop you from flirting with me?
The spirochetes will die off. But the little pieces of your cerebral cortex that have been destroyed won’t grow back. You’re brain damaged. Doomed to feeling good for the rest of your life.
Georgia!
Yeah…
[cell phone goes off] Yeah?
What about shampoo?
What about laundry detergent? Maybe they both washed their clothes this morning?
That’s how you got in, right? Jail house diaries?
Bring in the detergent. [hangs up]
Soaked into their clothes and got absorbed into their skin… [they enter Chi’s room. His parents are there] Hi, look, the clothes your son wore today. He washed them this morning, right?
Nice respectful Asian kid does the laundry.
Then I’m guessing he washed them last night, without you knowing.
What about Matt’s clothes? They new?
“Davis.”
And yet the label isn’t faded in the slightest. Fake old. 100 dollars for the homeless look. What, kids aren’t pretentious in England?
That is a question for the ages. In the meantime get these tests in.
Right, your wife does. She wants you to feel nice and comfortable.
So your skin absorbs a little dye, the odd chemical here and there…
Judging by the self importance of your strut, you have identified the chemical in question.
Hit him with the hydrolase.
Mighty mom said no. She’s gonna feel like million bucks when Chi lives and her son dies. Send Cameron. She’s the only one who’s managed to talk her into anything.
Thought I’d hang out in case you change your mind… and I can give Matt the medicine right away. Don’t worry, I’ve got time.
They will. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after. Takes time to review faxed records. Then they’ll probably tell you they can’t make a decision based on faxed records. [points to the TV] This is Suzy. She’s never gonna marry him… no money.
Same reason as last time. You wanna see how the other kid does first, that’s ok. Might help you. But there’s a real good chance that-
A little blunt… I was gonna say “run out of time,” or just sort of let my voice trail off… [Mom’s cell goes off]
They haven’t seen him. Can’t make a decision based on-
You fooled her with that?
Spilled pesticides on the pants, didn’t bother to clean up. So, why are you still here? Why aren’t you out there making up with the joyful mother?
No reason at all, you don’t care about her or her son.
Oops.
I want in.
He’s a musician? That paralysis thing, guy can’t walk for two years and nobody knows why, that seems mildly interesting.
Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.
But that “not walking” thing, that could turn into something serious!
Know all about it. Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries. Making real progress. Fixed everything but the legs.
Like I always say, there’s no “I” in “team”. There is a “me”, though, if you jumble it up. [They leave her office.]
I know. I did accidentally glance at his resume before I hired him.
He must have spoken to Foreman’s parole officer.
I respect that. I’m not going to get in his way.
It’s pneumonia, he can handle it. Guy’s already paralyzed, how badly can he screw it up?
Not yet. You gonna fire me?
Oh, this is fun. [Chase smiles.]
How about the paralysis?
Well, you certainly are, boss. Like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice. [Chase and Cameron sit.]
Lou Gehrig’s disease. It’s a lovely diagnosis. They make movies about it. No tests, no treatment. It’s a disease of exclusion –
I haven’t. [He gets up and takes the board marker from Foreman.] What else could it be?
Excellent. [He starts to write, but Foreman takes the marker away from him.]
Uncommon, but it fits. It’s also treatable. Did Hamilton try putting the guy on IVIG?
Well, let’s do an MRI of our own. [Chase and Cameron get up.]
It’s a death sentence.
[takes headphones off] He rhymes with dinner?
Oh. That makes more sense. You tell him it might not be ALS?
Well, no wonder he signed. Who wouldn’t?
Great. If it was my case, I’d be adding a little IVIG to the mix.
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.
DNR means “do not resuscitate”, not “do not treat”. You do nothing, it doesn’t matter which one of us is right. [He puts his headphones back on.] And hang on to that DNR. That signature could be worth a lot of money real soon. [Foreman leaves.]
You’re talking about your penis in the third person.
Separate vacations? That’d be a drag for one of you. I don’t think you need the pills. I think you have a conflict of medications. You need to up your insulin to “chocolate chip ice cream” levels.
Yeah, you remember. That’s the stuff you take for the diabetes that you forgot to tell the nurse about. Your hands. No hair, which means nerve damage. And your shoes look about two sizes too small which means you’ve lost sensation in your feet. And then there’s your pants.
No, they tell me you’re an idiot. Powdered sugar on the right pant leg. Based on the two napkins in your right pocket, I’m willing to bet it’s not your first donut of the day. [House’s beeper beeps, it says “Code Blue – John Henry Giles – Rm. 324”. House gives Willie a prescription.]
Sure, why not? If you’ve got heart disease from ignoring the diabetes they’ll kill you. Otherwise, you two have a fun weekend. [House leaves as Willie looks at the prescription skeptically.]
His stats are in the 70s. How long has he been like this?
Well, why aren’t you doing –
You put him on the IVIG?
So undo it! Chase!
Nobody killed him! He’s not dead! Chase, intubate him!
Bag.
Bag! [He grabs the bag himself and starts to ventilate. Cora walks in.] He had a bad reaction to some medicine we gave him.
The IVIG made him worse, which means multifocal motoneuropathy was a bad diagnosis. Okay, what’s really wrong with him?
Everyone knows what’s wrong with me. What’s wrong with him is much more interesting.
To intubate or not to intubate, that is the big ethical question. Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it, maybe just practice some medicine.
-- if the patient is competent to make it, if his thyroid numbers aren’t making him sad.
Why did he sign that DNR?
No, he signed the DNR ‘cause he didn’t want a slow and painful death from ALS. What was happening to him had nothing to do with his ALS.
Technically, your case. You screwed up. Is that what this is about? Looking bad in front of your old boss?
Fine. I’ll never do it again.
All the more reason this debate is pointless. [Foreman leaves.]
His lungs are worse. Any theories? [Cameron looks to see where Foreman went.] Oh, I’m sure he just went to the little boys’ room. Come on, people.
Wouldn’t likely hit both lungs.
Cuddy sent me a stripper again? Ah, love that woman. So thoughtful.
Well, it’s not great, but it’s better than ALS. At least it’s treatable.
Cameron, test the blood for c-ANCA.
He has blood left in the lab, just add on the c-ANCA. [to Chase] Foreman’s still got you doing bronchioscopic suctioning for the pneumonia?
Well, while you’re down in his lungs, grab a biopsy. We’ll need it to confirm Wegener’s. And move the patient to the second floor ICU.
It’s right above the clinic. I’m pretty sure it’s 50 feet in any direction. It’s nice having a court order saying you don’t have to work clinic duty. [He goes and sits in his office.]
[yelling] Dr. Cuddy!
You paged me.
His bed is behind that wall. The plaintiff’s. I can’t, you know, come any closer.
Can we get the lecture over with, because I’ve got a, actually, I’ve got nothing to do. Take your time.
You don’t have a problem with what I did?
Great. Any chance you could help me run some tests?
You can talk to him.
Yeah. I need a lawyer.
A medical tube, saving his life.
I’m sorry, your Honor. I was way out of line. [He sits.]
No.
Time.
I don’t want to get near him.
Are you done, or do you have more references to 1980s fads? I’m trying to listen to this. [He turns back to the topic at hand, tugging at his shirt collar.]
My staff are idiots. I’m sure you know what it’s like, your Honor.
Your Honor –
I have a medical issue.
It doesn’t. Do you have any history of heart disease in your family? [Giles’ attorney scoffs.]
Your fingers. They show signs of clubbing, which indicate a health problem. Remember Bart Giamotti? Same thing, just dropped dead one day. Please see your doctor.
Of course, I’m sorry. [He sits.]
I watched Matlock last night. [He pulls off his tie.]
Neither did I.
Every family has some history of heart disease.
Start him on Cytoxan.
Well, unfortunately I think we’ve exhausted all the tests we can do in the capacity as the doctors he doesn’t want doing tests on him.
We’ll know I’m right if he starts walking.
The medicine’s in the pharmacy, patient’s immobilized in the ICU. Sounds like a simple geography problem.
Uh, I’m Dr. House, I’m –
I’ve started him on Cytoxan.
Why?
There’s an error rate, Marty.
No, it’s mine. Eric.
Oh, this is wonderful. [They stop chatting.] But before you guys break out the oil, I should point out you can’t pull the plug; I have a court order.
I have the right to face my accuser. Judge said so.
He doesn’t have to die.
If it’s Wegener’s, his lungs won’t be able to handle it. As soon as they pull that plug he’ll die.
It’s not Wegener’s. Wrong again. [He walks off.]
The real question is, why is he still alive?
Yeah, seem to be doing that a lot, lately. People keep living because of my mistakes.
Assuming this is a progression of his paralysis.
Yes, his arm is paralyzed. Yes, his legs are paralyzed. Why is everyone so gung-ho to connect those two conditions? You could think I’m wrong, but that’s no reason to stop thinking?
Nope, not good enough.
Not interested in why. Let’s get an MR-angiogram for an embolic stroke.
They dropped the court order.
Good point, but I can go within 50 feet of him now.
Sure. That makes sense. You hate me for saving your life. In fairness to your side, you were also dying because of me, so –
That’s what’s interesting. Your thyroid was low, but not low enough to cause depression.
Those things are fun. Okay, life sucks. Your life sucks more than most. It’s not as bad as some, which is depressing all by itself. But do me a favor. Just let me find out what’s wrong with you. And if you still want to kill yourself, I’ll give you a hand. That sound fair?
And that’s all you are? A musician?
Really? Apparently, you know me better than I know you.
That’s why God made microwaves.
Yeah. [He walks to the door and opens it. Suddenly, he walks back and starts to undo the cords connecting John to the monitors.]
It’s not over for me. Either you’re gonna call the cops again, or we’re doing this. [He starts to wheel John’s bed out the door.] If you wanna die, you can do it just as easily inside an MRI machine. [At this point, the nurses at the desk are looking at House like he’s crazy. Hee!]
So, what’s the verdict?
Do it. See what happens to his arm.
His style involves humility. [small pause] Another difference in our styles: I don’t care much for apologies. You can go.
Do you mean genuine humility? You know, with all the self-doubt and the self-questioning, or Hamilton’s polite, patronizing “Aw, shucks” humility?
Thank you. And humility is an important quality. Especially if you’re wrong a lot.
Of course, when you’re right, self-doubt doesn’t help anybody, does it? [His beeper goes off.] We gotta go.
[mutters to Foreman] Congratulations… [aloud] Why, Marty?
The phone works. Next time you want to make me feel all warm and fuzzy, leave a message. [He taps John’s leg.] Don’t get me wrong, I’m overcome with joy.
What?
What, you gonna charge me with assault again?
He now has feeling all the way up to calf. This is the way medicine evolved. Patients sometimes get better. You have no idea why, but unless you give a reason they won’t pay you. Anybody notice if there’s a full moon?
No, I’m saying let’s rule out the lunar god and go from there.
It’s one of ours.
Easy. We stop all of them.
And the rest? Steroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, they’re toxic if we leave him on all of them.
Yeah, to his own funeral.
True. And then we’ll add our medications back, one at a time. If he gets better, then we’ll have our answer.
Then we’re in trouble. Not as much as he is. I suppose that was your point.
Don’t care.
If his stuff was helping the guy would be playing tennis six months ago. It’s our round of treatment that’s helping.
Yeah. [We see that they’re watching General Hospital on the portable TV.] My old philosophy used to be “Live and let live,” but I’m taking this needlepoint class and they gave us these really big pillows.
That’s a very tiny pillow.
Can it wait for the commercial, Marty? Say “hi” to my friend, Jimmy.
Seriously, commercial’s in about five minutes.
Only if we’re watching in the bathtub.
Forget it. And if Foreman tells you what John Henry used to be on –
Nope. Make him live out every day of his two-year contract.
Not yet.
You’re a polite twit, but you’re not an idiot.
Wait a second. You’re not an idiot. You need to know what medications I’ve stopped, because…
He’s getting worse. [He whacks John’s leg with a clipboard. Nothing.] [to Foreman] Right now you still work for me. Come on!
No feeling, no wiggling. The bad news is, John Henry’s back where he started. The good news is, Hamilton looks bad.
What was the first thing we put him on?
Well, put him back on them. Give them 24 hours, see what happens.
Sure hope not. I didn’t much like that lawyer. And get an MRI.
Well, obviously something is different now. Do it again. Chase, take care of the scan. Cameron, put him on the steroids. [to Foreman] We should probably talk, huh?
I checked him out. He’s a great doctor. You think he’s better than I am?
Answer the question. It’s not going to change my opinion of myself. Might affect my opinion of you, but that shouldn’t affect your opinion of yourself. Now I’m getting confused. If you think he’s a better doctor than I am, then you should take the job. Otherwise, you should get him to buy you two or three more nostalgic lunches and politely decline.
Oh, how do I abuse you?
I hold you accountable, so what?
That is not what he does!
He never said you were forgiven. I was there, he said it wasn’t your fault.
So, it was. You took a chance, you did something great. You were wrong, but it was still great. You should feel great that it was great. You should feel like crap that it was wrong. That’s the difference between him and me. He thinks you do your job, and what will be, will be. I think that what I do and what you do matters. He sleeps better at night. He shouldn’t. [Cameron and Chase come running in.]
Causing his paralysis.
Well, we missed it, too. ‘Cause it wasn’t there before.
No. It was on the spine, it wasn’t on the MRI. [He points to the scan from a few days ago.] Same anatomic location.
Well, what is there?
Or something that looks like nothing.
Revealing the AVM, which has always been there, hiding behind its own swelling. We remove that, he’ll walk again.
Fifty bucks says I can beat you to the curb. [John laughs.]
I can’t do anything else. [He takes the Vicodin.] You’re much more easily amused when you can walk.
Wow.
I’m in pain.
Oh, don’t worry about it. You’ll be jogging before you need a second one. [Foreman comes out a side door.] See you tomorrow, Eric.
Foreman is wrong? The neurologist is wrong, about a neurological problem?
So, you figure he’s not being objective
Both of which Foreman saw?
Whoah, whoah, whoah, back up there, big fella. Foreman’s the guy you want to take a swing at.
[starts to look interested] That’s not even close to being true. Something else. Something personal. [pauses] Give me the file. Looks like this will be fun.
Glad you could join us, Eric. What’s the differential for a twitch in the wrist?
The big question, you’re missing it, all of you. [He drops Jane’s smelly bag on the table.]
Who is she?
Do I need a better reason?
[dumps contents of smelly bag on table, everyone turns away in disgust] The only thing we know for sure about Jane Doe is that her name isn’t Jane Doe. Which means no medical history. Allergies, medication, previous diagnoses, treatment – we have no baseline, no context for medical treatment.
[holds up a sweater] Vomit. Still moist. [sniffs] What do you think - a couple of days old? [puts it in Chase’s face]
Yeah. And here’s the big finish… [licks fingers]
Salty. Chemical imbalance.
Or high calcium. Or it’s a coincidence. The point is, we don’t know anything.
The MRI can wait. Hang a banana bag, give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance, we’ll take it from there.
At the moment, how much you don’t want me to take it. That’s pretty fascinating.
Really? Sounds exactly like something I’d do.
We’ll surgically remove the pin, then do the MRI, does that sound good?
Dr. Foreman, a neurologist, believes this woman has a brain tumor.
[glares at Foreman] Hey, don’t ever apologize for a medical opinion. [to Cuddy] If he’s right, we don’t do this test, the patient dies. Now I realize that you have a specialty of your own, but does yours have anything to do with the brain? [nods at Foreman] His does.
Hey! He knows more homeless people than any of us. [Cuddy and Foreman don’t look amused] Go check out the ‘hood, dawg.
[enters] Not wearing a coat in this weather. That is so wrong.
[picks one up] She sign them? Her name would be a start.
[holds up comic book and looks at it] Philadelphia. Look at that skyline! It’s very evocative. The Chrysler Building.
Mmm… I’m getting Philly. And that cactus, well, that’s a smashed car – car accident.
Water – well, water’s October, right?
On the page number 22, so that’s October 2nd, 2002. Ergo, the patient was in a car accident two years ago last October.
[squints] Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it – with this. [holds up metal pin]
Surgical pin. Better than a wallet. Serial numbers in case of recall, tied to a patient’s name.
You didn’t think I was going to do it to save your sorry ass, did you? [sounds of a fax coming through] You might want to take a look at that. Her name is Victoria Matson, at least that’s the one she used then. Any hospital with the record of treating her should be sending that information.
And we still think there’s nothing wrong with her?
We almost killed her – that’s different. And we know who she is.
Put her back on it. She cheers up; she might stop biting people
Actually, it would. Neoplastic Syndrome associated with the cancer could cause her to twitch like a bunny on crystal meth. Ultrasound her ovaries.
No. Foreman was wrong. I’m starting to wonder about that guy’s medical chops.
[fake sneeze] You know, I think I might be coming down with something. Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry. [starts walking toward exit]
[turns] Bye-bye. [keeps walking]
This stuff’s pretty good. Calendrica, works for the counseled genius. Bad guy’s Mr. Fury, fairly generic, no special skills, but apparently very well organized. Think you work hard, try ruling the universe.
We’ve got the flowing dress, the ring. Think the patient was married? Maybe it was a bad break up, maybe he dumped her cause she was on drugs.
Nope. Question is, why don’t you? [Foreman looks away] I hate to cite a cliché, but – Dad on the streets?
They’re both living on the streets?
So who pissed you off?
Your turn, you gonna tell me why this case?
So she’s just another sick person the kindly Dr. Wilson has made sure doesn’t get lost in the big ugly system.
You’re giving two craps.
Time for Girl Scout cookies already?
[makes big show out of stifling pretend sneeze] Okay.
[huge, loud sneeze]
My specialty.
It’s all about the giving back. [Cuddy walks off, House turns to students] Good old Cuddy. Always thinking. She assign you a patient to interview? [reaches for pills]
Then why are you still here?
Had to get away from those students so I faked a page. [flips through file] Foreman’s parents, happily married, 40 years.
Keinahora. So, why does he hate homeless people? If it’s an uncle or a grandparent you’d think he’d use it in his college application essay. Family struggles beats a 4.0 GPA any day.
Maybe he’s just a snob.
I don’t need to watch the OC, but it makes me happy.
Wilson, James. Boy wonder oncologist. You know him?
Why can’t both be true? Come on.
Unless it’s not cancer.
Well, hard not to – nothing funnier than cancer. But what if it’s a tuberculoma. She’s living out on the streets, breathing all kinds of crap 24/7. The odds are she’s got TB, why can’t she have a nice benign growth to go with it?
You’re right. It’s not even close. Start her on INH, Rifampicin and Streptomycin.
And what is the treatment for advanced ovarian cancer?
I didn’t know the biopsy was back.
[leans back in chair] 105…
[looks at test results] So – we’re right about the diagnosis, and the treatment for that diagnosis is killing her. Perfect.
Poach. Better metaphor.
[turning to face them] Okay you two, grab some scalpels and settle this like doctors. Send blood and urine cultures and get a chest x-ray. And fine, take her off Prozac and put her on Bromocryptin for the Serotonin syndrome.
Continue.
And you’re calling attention to your bosom by wearing a low-cut top. [looks up] Oh, I’m sorry, I thought we were having a state-the-obvious contest. I’m competitive by nature.
Nope. I’m supposed to be teaching you. If I can do that without listening, more power to me.
[interrupts] This guy’s supposed to have universal power over all of gravity; how come his hair won’t stay down? That’s just stupid.
Hard to believe that one patient could slip past Cuddy and get herself admitted with a sprained wrist. Two seems almost impossible - what room?
Patients lie. But usually only one lie at a time; how much does she weigh?
Poundage, ladies, and by the by, what color is her nose?
[pager goes off] Almost nothing. She’s either under 90 pounds, or she has a red nose. I gotta go.
That would be telling. [looks at students and smiles] Oh, I am just too nice. It starts with ‘C’. [drops medical dictionary on desk as he leaves]
I assume there’s a positive coming.
Well, meningitis is nice and simple. Get her in isolation and start her on Ceftriaxone. Either she gets better or she dies. [ducklings walk toward door] Let me know which one happens!
Wrong coat. The cape’s in the closet, I had it cleaned.
You gonna save her?
You’ve been reading. My, how you’ve changed.
Do you even know what that is, or are you just guessing everything that starts with ‘C’?
Cacchi – C-A-C- she’s going alphabetically.
It sets off my eyes. [smiles and enters room with patient] Hi, Jodi, I’m Dr. House. What brings you to the hospital?
How did that happen?
How horrifying.
[turns to students]
No, her wrist really does hurt.
Of course you are. You have no idea what happened. You have no memory. [House exits room with students] Korsakoff’s syndrome. Her brain is damaged by excessive drinking or insufficient diet; pretty obviously the latter. She has no new memories, no new ideas, can’t even process that idea. So her brain fills the gaps as best it can using visual clues. The horse on your shirt led her to the riding accident and the surf scene on your clipboard led her to the beach.
I didn’t say ‘C’. Or did I? Lesson to be learned – treat everybody as if they have Korsakoff’s, we all lie anyway. Give her Thiamine right away, she’ll bounce back pretty quickly. And then get her to eat some cake and ice cream.
Yes?
Hi! Jodi, I’m Dr. House. What happened to your wrist?
See? It’s like it never happened. Perfect forgiveness.
Her heart rate dropped when you administered the Adenosine.
It’s still meningitis.
Start the treatment. [leaves room]
You should read my reports. I make up stuff all the time. What really happened?
Wow. That is a great looking gun. [close up on policeman’s belt]
It’s so cool looking. What does it do? Fire about 60,000 volts? At least, that’s what it would take to jack someone’s heart up to 150s.
Fine. [reaches into jacket] Don’t tell me. Tell my friend, Ben Franklin. [holds up $100 bill, then sets it on the counter] I watch a lot of cop shows.
The good news is, the heart rate thing’s not connected to her condition.
Well, that brings us to the bad news. The cop tasered her.
The first time he hit her in the thigh, and she just kept going, like it was nothing. Right about here. [He marks the spot. Victoria doesn’t move; House pokes her with a needle.] She didn’t feel the taser. [pulls down sheets and pokes her toe]
Yeah, in that one spot.
I don’t think so. [takes swab of Victoria’s mouth]
Is that where she bit you? [close up of Foreman’s bandaged forearm]
Can’t get angry if you don’t feel anything.
First there’s localized numbness, then sensitivity to light, disorientation, paranoia, ineffectiveness of sedatives, and then hydrophobia. Fear of water. [machine starts up]
Yeah. That’s because non-homeless people, when they get bitten, they get shots.
A day, maybe two. [turns to Foreman] And if you don’t get your shot in, say, the next three hours, I’m going to have to make another affirmative action hire.
No. You were wearing rain boots today, but you were parked in the underground garage, so the only reason you’d need boots was if you were hitting the streets… I followed you.
Yeah. I had some follow up questions. I’ve met your parents, and your brother –
Why wouldn’t you tell me –
Why not?
Well, that’s relevant.
What lie are they telling you? [Pharmacist gestures for him to wait.]
Come on.
 Hmmm.  That’s a tough one.  If only we had some way to communicate with another part of the building. [He picks up the phone for the pharmacist, Cameron walks up.]
Internal bleeding after a car accident, wow, that’s shocking! [to pharmacist] Let me talk to shipping, I speak their language.
[to Cuddy, who is at the clinic desk] Your hospital doesn’t have my pain medication.
Right, the bleed caused the crash.  Blood got on the road, it got all slippery. [to the room] Anyone here got drugs? [everyone looks at him, one clinic patient raises his hand]
Dad loved that.
Don’t talk.
Well, thank God you took control.
He must have inherited it.  He’s gonna die.  My condolences.
Give her back the file; you have bigger problems to tend to, like my meds.
He’s got meningitis.
Artificial heart valve.
Get everyone in my office.
Kid’s gonna be dead in a matter of days if we don’t figure out why his red blood cells are disintegrating, so differential diagnosis, people.
No.  If it’s environmental he’ll get better just from staying here.
Okay, so it’s infection, lupus, drugs, or cancer.
Why not?  Great meeting. [He starts to leave.]
My leg gave us ‘till 11:15.  I’ll talk to Wilson about lymphoma, [to Cameron] ANA for lupus, [to Chase] radioimmunoassay for drugs, [to Foreman] and you… you test for whatever you thought it was. [He leaves.] I’ve got a date with a pharmacist.
Come on, come on, come on, come on… [As soon as House gets the bottle, he dry-swallows a couple pills.  Cuddy catches up to him on his way out the clinic doors.
Like what, laughter?  Meditation?  Got a guy who can fix my third chakra?
If the pills ran my life I’d agree with you, but it’s my leg busy calendaring what I can’t do.
Right, I never had an infarction in my leg, no dead muscle, no nerve damage.  Doesn’t even hurt. [he presses the button for the elevator]  Actually, it kind of tickles.  The chicks dig this. [raises cane]  Better than a puppy.
Oh, that’s way too much!  Moderation is the key.  Unless there’s pain.
‘Cause you’re twice as annoying.
About how big your ass has gotten lately?  Not me, I defend it.  You got back.  [They walk into the full elevator.]
No, I don’t want to go a week without the drugs, it’ll hurt.
Well, I guess we’ll never know.
No way!  I love the clinic.
Pills don’t make me high.  They make me neutral.
You’re on, mister. [He throws the pills to Cuddy, who looks positively giddy.]
Nothing?
Yeah, I got that from the “nothing”.  Where’s his hematocrit?
[as the Ducklings enter the room] Polite for a dying kid. [He starts to limp off.]
I’m fine.
Forget the eye.  Tell him to use the other one to look on the bright side.  The clot tells us something.  It could help us figure out what he has, which could mean he gets to live. [The three of them are staring… Chase openly curious, Foreman with disgust, Cameron with something like pity.]  Differential diagnosis, people.  How does internal bleeding suddenly start clotting?
This is true.  But why are you the one saying it?  What are you doing here?  I thought we ruled out cancer.
Well, go see Cuddy.  She needs a friend.
That’s why you’re here?  She wants you to keep an eye on me, make sure I don’t cheat.
I’m fine.
You ever been shot?
Withdrawal symptoms.  Not applicable.  The only side-effects I’m going to have are some pain and thirty days of freedom. [Pause.  Interestingly enough, now Cameron looks disgusted.]  Am I the only one who’s concerned about a dying kid?  If it’s not lupus, what else?
Okay, what hides from a gallium scan?  [He turns to see… a beautiful woman stretching in his office!  Ooookay.  The rest of the ducklings continue the conversation as though they don’t see her.]
I’m sorry, I wasn’t paying attention.  What happened?
Great.  Echocardiogram for the heart and IV antibiotics for the infection, stat.  [Chase, Cameron and Foreman leave, Wilson walks over.  Now, there’s another person who can see the woman.  Yes, indeed.]
Is it my birthday?
I’m not lonely, my leg hurts.
She’s five hundred dollars an hour, minimum.
The envious, jealous, I-never-got-any-in-high-school kind of logic, hello!
Because she’s beautiful I should do it?  What kind of pathetic logic is that?
Hi.  Listen, I’m, I’m sure you’re really good at whatever it is you do –
Hey, no, let go of my hand.
Ow! Ow… ah… ah…. oh, my God. [Woman looks happy.  And if Wilson’s looks could take people’s clothes off, this show wouldn’t be TV-14.] Bueno.
Thank you.
I had a massage.
I’m fine.
Never met a diagnostic study I couldn’t refute.
So, double the dosage.  70mg.
Oh, you’re right.  Save the kidney.  The guy we transplant it into will be grateful.
Nothing we can do about his eye.
Read the memo.
If the artery expands, the clot might move out on its own.  That’s very creative.  Why didn’t you mention this before?
You should have.  [As Chase walks away, House leans back against the wall.]
What’s wrong?
Would not have caused this.
It’s not drugs!  His liver is shutting down.
It means he’s all better.  He’s ready to go home.
What do you think it means?  You can’t live without a liver, he’s dying!
Bum leg, what’s yours?
It was a dumb question.
You’re right, it wasn’t.
[walking in] That’s what they said about Manson.  Do you want to continue talking about me or should we discuss what the liver damage tells us?  [No answer.]  I was born in a log cabin in Illinois –
It’s moving too fast.  Could be hepatitis-E.
Its history.  Since he’s been in and out of the country four times in the last year…
No.  I think the lupus is way more likely.
No, we should rule out hep-E.
I said lupus was way more likely, but if we treat for lupus and it is hep-E.
Exactly.
Yeah, I went to medical school, too.  Start him on solumedrol. (sp?)
Not as much.  Goldilocks, people.  It won’t hurt him so much that it’ll kill him, and it won’t hurt him so little that we can’t tell.  It’ll hurt him just right.  And if it does nothing…
Now watch me do it while drinking a glass of water.
You think he’ll go for that?
No.  I want you to lie.
Because he trusts you.
Accidentally closed the car door on it.
I want my lawyer.
Well, my hand hurts like hell.  Yeah, I feel much better.
Don’t splint it.  I want to be able to bang it against the wall if I need to administer another dose.  Just… tape it up.  [Cuddy walks in.]
[to Wilson] Make it tight will ya.
Nothing I could say is going to change how you feel, and nothing could come out of your reaction that is going to change what I plan to do, so I prefer to say nothing.
Uh-huh.
And scared.
Yeah, Cameron told me and I told her to tell him no.
Neither can the father.
Well, he’s the dad.  I should win easily.
What, ‘cause I lied to a patient?  I take risks, sometimes patients die.  But not taking risks causes more patients to die, so I guess my biggest problem is I’ve been cursed with the ability to do the math. [Cameron walks in; it’s a veritable party in the exam room!]
What did he say?
And that’s when he caved.
Two plus two equals four.
Who’s Jules?  Any mention of her in the medical history?
There’s no need to get snippy.  This kind of lupus takes years to get to this point, it’s been a week.
You’re saying I screwed up.
Then why didn’t you just say that?
Did you agree with my recommendation to treat for hep-E?
And then she went and lied to the father.  That’s why you’re angry.
You always trust me.  Big mistake.  Lupus is a bad diagnosis.
That doesn’t make it good.
Put him on the transplant list.  And make sure Cuddy knows, see if she can do anything to get him close to the top. [He stands slowly and walks into his office.  Chase and Cameron leave.  Foreman waits, and follows House.  House, meanwhile, is throwing up in a trashcan.  He looks up and sees Foreman.]  Cafeteria.  Stay away from the sushi.
Got stuck in a drawer.
No, I am going through pain.  Pain causes nausea.
And your solution is to give me drugs.  It’s interesting.
Who’s Jules?
Jules.  There’s no Jules in the history.
Of what?
I don’t think this is lupus.
Your fourth diagnostic criterion of lupus is psychosis; this is just a kid missing his cat.
There’s a difference between psychosis and hallucination.
Psychosis requires –
You have a dead family pet, and you never mentioned it?  Nice family history.
How did the cat die?
What happened to the cat?
When?
Where’d she sleep?
It’s not lupus.  Where is Jules?
Stop the gases.
Saving a sixteen-year-old kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs and a very nasty scar.  This kid doesn’t have lupoid hepatitis.  He has acute naphthalene toxicity.
Nope. [holds up tweezers] Termites.  They create naphthalene to protect their nests, which I’m assuming is rather large and is inside all four walls of his bedroom at home. [He tosses the tweezers on the surgical equipment.]
The autopsy I just conducted on his pet cat.
You are not removing that kid’s liver.
No, but I have been feeling a little sick lately.  Achoo!
Why are you so eager to cut into a healthy kid?
He just needs some chicken soup.
No, you’re not.
If the food here wasn’t one step below Riker’s Island he would’ve gotten better.  He’s lost fourteen pounds.
Naphthalene is a gas, a fat soluble gas.  The kid breathes it in, it gets stored in his fat cells.  Outside the hospital his body burned protein and carbs for energy, and the naphthalene stayed in fat.  But once the car accident put him in the hospital, and he started losing weight [CGI of Keith’s fat cells, full of toxin being freed], his body had to get its energy somewhere else.  It started to burn fat.  The floodgates opened, the poison poured into his system.
Getting him away from his dad’s meatloaf is what’s killing him. [Cuddy and Keith’s dad walk up to House, very quickly.]
Your cat did not die of old age.  He died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure caused by naphthalene poisoning, the exact same thing your son has.
Give me twenty-four hours, we’ll pump your son full of calories –
[getting up slowly]  If you do the surgery, you’ll be killing a mother of four.
I was guessing.
Naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation we have for what’s wrong with your son.  It explains the internal bleeding, the hemolytic anemia, the liver failure… it also predicts what’ll happen next.  If you do the surgery he’s gonna lay on that table for fourteen hours while his body continues to burn fat and release poison into his system.  Either way, I did you a favor.  He’s awake now, you’ve got a chance to say goodbye. [slight pause]
And won my prize.
Cuddy’s a sucker.  I would have done it for two weeks off.
Yeah, I’m an addict. [He goes into his office.  Wilson follows.]
I’m not stopping.
I don’t need to stop.
I said I was an addict.  I didn’t say I had a problem.  I pay my bills, I make my meals.  I function.
I don’t want any relationships.
I’ve been alienating people since I was three.
Well, of, of course I have.  I’ve, I’ve gotten older.  My hair’s gotten thinner.  Sometimes I’m bored, sometimes I’m lonely, sometimes I wonder what it all means.
[slams his cane down on the shelf] Of course I’ve changed! [pause]
They let me do my job, and they take away my pain. [Wilson walks off, looking defeated.]
[On cell phone] No, price is not a problem if you have what I need. *Click*
Young man?
Well, if he’s an old man, osteopenia would just be a fact of life, you make him comfortable, send him home, which means you’re just boring me. So he’s young, which means it’s most likely caused by cancer, and you’re here because you haven’t found it. Have you looked really, really hard?
Well, how old is he? Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset.
It’s Hank Wiggen? [Takes the card and looks at it] He signed it, sweet. [Reads] “To Jimmy Wilson, the Cy Young of medicine.” You ask for that?
Beat the Yankees, and save the free world.  [Hands the card to Wilson and goes into his office.]
Come on, people. [Pulls out the baseball card] He was 17 and 7! His ERA was 2.1.
My God, you’re right, I lost my head. All life is equally sacred. And I promise you, the next knitting injury that comes in here, we’re on it like stink on cheese. [Chase smirks] He weighed 175 his rookie year.
Now he’s 195 after playing a year in Japan. Why?
And the bone loss. Go ask him what he’s on. When he says nothing, have him pee in a cup. [Chase leaves, and House turns his attention to Foreman.] If your car breaks down, you’re an hour late, not two minutes. And two minutes isn’t late enough to use a clever excuse like car trouble.
Huh. Unprompted lies, that’s a bad sign. Either a guilty conscience or something personal’s going on. [Foreman sits down with his coffee] See, that’s all you had to do, Just walk in, sit down, do your job. [Leaves]
You need cash?…Ah, no, I, I don’t have that much on me…No no, it’s not a problem. No, I’ll be over by 6. ‘Kay. *Click* [To receptionist] 5 p.m., Dr. House checks out.
I was rounding up.
Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Kathy.
Ah. [checks watch] Uh, trouble with the leg? [Carol nods, House spots a bridal magazine in her purse] When’s the wedding?
Not much time to fit into that pretty dress, and no time for practical shoe-shopping. You’re running two miles a day further than you should be.
New shoes, less miles, and ex-nay on the afternoon Cokes, you’re gonna look beautiful. [Looks at the next guy] What’s wrong with you?
That’s because you’re trying to remove your corneas. [walks over to next man] What’s wrong with you?
Yeah, yeah. Symptoms, [gestures at Cuddy] we’re working on a personal best here.
And?
Well, neither would I, if I was having trouble controlling my pee pee! [to dentist] You’re a dentist. Nitrous oxide poisoning, which means you’re either dipping into your own supply, or you’ve got a bad valve in the office. Laughing gas rehab’s probably more expensive than the plumber. Meanwhile, get yourself some B12. [moves to the next victim] Who’s left?
Well, make friends with the dentist. He can give you a note, and maybe a little nitrous to take the edge off. [he observes the clock, which reads 4:47, and walks through the door.]
Or steroids. You guys got any money on you?
50 of them? [Cameron looks shocked] Foreman?
Well, that just leaves us with steroids!
Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. But there’s one thing they can’t hide…[checks his watch and walks past Ducklings 1 and 2.]
Hi. I’m Dr. House. [walks over to Hank’s bed] And this is the coolest day of my life. [With an even bigger grin…he whips the covers off Hank’s bed!] See? Steroid use shrinks the testicles. [The Ducklings look rather embarrassed]
Your lips say no, your prunes say yes. Hypogonadism. Isn’t that a great word? Thanks, we don’t get to say it nearly enough. [To Cameron] Start him on Lupron right away. [Walks out the door.]
These freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment, for money. I feel sorry for them. [Pops a Vicodin. Lola runs after him]
Uh-huh.
Yes.
[thinks for a moment] It’s creamy. But, I had 3 reasons.
Well, we’ll see in a minute, I’m just making them up now…He lied to me first.
If he lies to me about not taking steroids, then I lie to him about not treating steroids, he’s cured. Adds up for me-
If I told him the truth, he wouldn’t have taken the stuff.
…Severe respiratory problems.
I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect.
Which brings me to my fourth reason.
I thought you’d buy one of them.
He’s not gonna sue.
Good guess, but no. If the Lupron causes respiratory problems, it means he’s not on steroids, which means there’s something else wrong with him. And the choices, for that something else, are almost universally very bad. [Ooh, serious.]
Osteopenia messing his bones up. Hypogonadism. Impaired liver function, kidney function, and…we have managed to find the only professional athlete in the galaxy who is not on steroids. AND it’s not cancer. So, what’s killing him? [looks up as Foreman enters…late again.] Who shares my suspicions that the Yankees were somehow involved?
[glances at Foreman and checks his watch] Throw out the lungs, that was the Lupron, my fault. Don’t worry, I’ll send him a nice note.
Pretty small environment. Wife’s fine, no one else is sick.
Addison’s disease, I like it. Mainly of course, because the treatment is…
Enough irony for all of us.
Well, we’ll get him a new kidney. [Cameron looks surprised]
Cameron, if you could make an ironic guess right about now?
Agreed. He’s not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could’ve caused the kidney damage.
You see, kidneys don’t wear watches. Sure, gallbladders do, but it doesn’t matter, ‘cuz kidneys can’t tell time. Steroid damage could take years.
I don’t know. How many times did he lie about cocaine before coming clean with the league?
Oh, that’s right, I remember. You never did come clean. The league was out to get you, they faked the blood tests, you had to get yourself a lawyer-
That’s too bad. Because our theory is that the kidney damage is caused by A, and everything else is caused by B. The beauty of this theory is that we can treat A and B. But if you add the kidney symptoms back into the mix, then we are looking at another letter altogether, one that is apparently not in the alphabet.  Can’t fix the bones, no more baseball, no more breathing…no more brain function.
Okay. Yeah. Think I’ve got one in my other pants. [starts to leave]
And you never tried too hard to find out either.
Good. Very good, yeah.
He needs a new kidney. I was thinking the kidney people might have some.
He’s a professional ballplayer, brings joy to millions. Do you really want to be known as the hospital that sent him home to die? [Puts a fist down on some papers on her desk]
Everything else is related to the Addison’s.
The test for Addison’s is always inconclusive.
You’re not putting him on the list. [Moves his hand, Cuddy takes paper]
You take a perverse pleasure at turning me down.
Oh, I’m sorry Doctor, I didn’t know you were busy. Want me to come back?
No. [walks over to her]
…Okay.
Not my area. That is, however, my chair.
Very noble gesture. My favorite kind-dramatic, yet completely empty. The chances of non-identical twins being a match-
You writing a book?
That explains it, I told them to put it on my door.
Yeah. Right. True love. That’s just how we match organs these days. There’s a couple in France-high school sweethearts-they’re trading brains.
I scored. [holds up an envelope] It’s a brave new world, Doc, and we are at the cutting edge. You are looking [Wilson pulls the envelope open…and his jaw drops to his knees!] at two all-access passes to Paradise itself!
True cost, no man can say.
One thousand dollars. Friday night-the biggest official monster truck jam in the history of New Jersey!
Whatever you’ve got, you cancel.
Listen, they only give these tickets to owners. [Wilson is stuttering like an idiot] Anytime. We wanna be in the middle of the track, we’re in the middle of the track. These tickets are so good…we have to sign a release. I mean it. We do this, we could die.
[looks disappointed, then turns away] Fine. I’ll ask one of my other friends. [gets up as Wilson snorts in disbelief, and he turns around.] What, you’re saying I’ve only got one friend?
[thinks a moment] Kevin, in Bookkeeping.
I call him Kevin. It’s a secret “friendship club” name.
Believe me, I’d much rather be with your better half. And by better half, of course, I mean the one who struck out Sammy Sosa on three pitches and talks a lot less. But I thought I would talk to you first, and alone. [picks up a folder and opens it] I got your results back from the lab…you DO match.
You’re also pregnant. [Lola gasps, and tears fill her eyes; a smile spreads wide across her face; House watches her reaction carefully.] You can’t be a donor. [Lola looks at him, confused] Not in your current condition. [She swallows hard, and manages a weak smile. A single tear spills down her face.]
[walks over to the bookshelf and shuffles through it] If she terminates the pregnancy, he’s not going to let himself die on principle.
[turns around and gives her a piercing look] Please tell me I don’t have to decide. [Cameron looks hurt, and House lays off the sarcasm a little] Depends, how long would they live?
Fifty years, no problem. Six months, I say let ‘em die. Well, I’ve actually given this a lot of thought, and my personal tipping point is seven years, eight months, and 14 days.
You found religion.
There seems to be a correlation. [Cameron looks away; House watches her for a moment then looks away, eyes darting about awkwardly.] I’m, uh…[he fiddles with the books a moment] Do you like monster trucks?
…Right. [he looks down for a moment] I got two tickets. [Cameron looks at him, puzzled] Friday night.
Sure. Sounds good.
Exactly. Except for the “date” part. [She stares at him, shocked speechless. He turns away quickly, embarrassed.] Forget it. [starts to walk to the computer desk]
‘Course, you have to hear Wilson’s lecture. [sits down]
[thinks a moment] A for effort.
I thought it was up.
I have no idea. [To Chase] Hit him with the atropine (sp?) before he gets to 35 again.
Apparently, that’s not enough.
What did you do to him?
But something did. [He sighs, and heads for the door] Call me when he’s stable…or dead. [leaves]
Three more symptoms. Heart rate up, heart rate down, now he’s hallucinating.
No REM. He’s actually awake.
Not psychedelics, not with the heart symptoms.
…Yeah. Pithy analysis. [gets up]  I can see why they asked you to speak at the cancer dinner. I’m sorry I’m gonna miss it.
No, I think it’s great. You’re…giving back. [starts out the door]
Spoke Spanish. Told them I was the new shortstop from the Dominican.
Lousy. [he studies Warner’s hands with a keen interest] Around your fingernails, that swelling, it’s called clubbing. Hippocrates noticed that a lot of his friends who also had that, tended to frequently grab their chests and die.
What do you take for it?
Got ‘em with you? [Warner reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a half-empty/half-full bottle.]
Don’t bother. [Warner stops and looks at him.] Hank Wiggen stole your pills. He tried to kill himself. [Warner stares at House. House stares right back. STARING CONTEST!]
So what happened? He left the bottle open, while he went to get some water? Next time, just take the whole bottle.
See, people remember how many they’ve got. Date’s right on the label, number of pills, regular person can do the math. But a junkie doesn’t have to. It’s how many pills he’s got left, that’s all he’s thinking about. Bought a big insurance policy?
Not for you, no. Most reputable stores won’t cash your checks after you’re dead. But for Lola-well, girls like that, they’re all about the money-
You owe her.
[nods] So, the attempted suicide, the scaring her to death, that’s-what is that, that’s-gratitude? Love? Yeah, I get that. [Hank stares at the ceiling] We’ll take out what you did to yourself yesterday, we’re back to the kidneys and the bones. [as he stands up, he sets his cane down near Hank’s urine bag.] I’m scheduling the transplant. [turns to leave, but Hank lashes out suddenly, grabbing House’s coat. House stumbles against the urine bag, and his pants get drenched…eeeew! He looks down at his pants in disgust and anger.] NEVER visit a patient.
[nods slowly] I’ll start treating the Addison’s, which will most likely destroy what’s left of your kidneys-
[irritatedly] Hank Wiggen peed on me. What d’you think these pants are worth on eBay?
Is it that bad?
‘Course, why should I trust someone who lies about what he’s doing Friday night? [stops to face Wilson] Question is, what are you really doing Friday night? Or more to the point, what could possibly be better than monster trucks? Or are we breaking up? [turns to enter his office. Wilson lets out a long sigh, then follows House inside. House is rummaging through his duffel bag.]
I definitely had pants here. [turns to face Wilson] Wait a second, is that Stacy the Stripper? I heard she’s playing Atlantic City.
You thought I couldn’t handle this news. [Wilson’s eyes fall to the floor and he nods. House turns his attention to the bag] You talk to her a lot?
What is this, eighth grade? [looks at Wilson] I’m fine.
[suddenly] No! It’s…[zips the bag quickly and controls his voice] I have no right to be upset. You two are friends. [looks back at Wilson calmly] You should see her. Say hi for me.
[tosses the bag under his desk] I’m not the cancer doctor who’s lying about the cancer dinner. [takes his cane off the desk] I’m not the one who’s betraying all those…bald-headed dying kids. [Wilson smirks, and House heads out the door] I’m gonna go get some pants, I stink.
He tried to kill himself.
No.
And he can make decisions about his. He doesn’t want your kidney. [Lola looks shocked and upset]
…Probably.
If you keep that appointment, he’ll also probably die. [Lola sobs into his shoulder] Keep the baby. [He reaches up and awkwardly pats her shoulder. He makes a face as the smell of the urine meets his nose.]
…Are you just being polite? [She pulls away from him, confused] See, my pants are…[gestures to his leg]
…You can’t smell that? [she shakes her head, and he looks intently at her, processing this.]
[looking down at Sharon] So, you’re the new Arnie.
Would you get me a coffee? Black, no sugar. [Sharon smiles, confused, and leaves the table. House sits down, turns his attention to the Ducklings.] Okay, so who is it? [The Ducklings look confused] Come on, she’s sleeping with one of you. [Chase snorts, and House looks hopefully at Cameron] Oh God, please tell me it’s you. [Cameron looks shocked]
Don’t worry, you’re not gay…you’re adventurous! [Ducklings roll their eyes]
I’m afraid not, no. The groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to Mick.
We rejected environmental causes because the wife was healthy. Well, she’s not. Last six months, she can’t smell a thing. If you think of them as one single patient, add her symptoms to his…[Chase nods]
It explains everything. Even why they had so much trouble getting pregnant.
So, where else is cadmium?
Much better.
What d’you mean?
Why should they care that he’s being treated for Addison’s?
My report says I am.
Everybody does stupid things, it shouldn’t cost them everything they want in life.
I’m telling you, Gravedigger never disappoints. [Cameron sees a couple pass by, arms around each other.]
[quietly] Well now, let’s not ruin a lovely night out by getting personal.
I lived with someone for a while. [Looks down at his empty cotton candy cone, then at Cameron’s] You gonna finish that?
Baffling. Though I vaguely recall a disease called noomonia, numania?
Pneumonia! That’s it. Just a guess here, but are his parents big donors?
Tiny unicorns goring his bronchial tubes would be cooler. And the way you’re ignoring my question… wow, they’re extremely big donors.
Excessive irritation. He’s 12, he’s on auto-stroke –
Ah, you need a dermatologist. If it’s dry, keep it wet, if it’s wet, keep it dry, if it’s not supposed to be there, cut it off. I never could master all of that. [House finds what he’s been looking for – a Vicodin.] There you are. Were you scared? It’s okay. You’re home now. [He takes it.]
Cuddy. As a special favor to you –
The rash is a total snooze. [takes the chart] Unless it’s connected to the pneumonia, then it’s party time.
Purulent sputum, dyspnea, bronchi bilaterally. What causes this kind of rash?
Send off a urine antigen and check if he’s joined the Elks. Next?
Excellent. Maybe the lodge went spelunking.
Their mistake. That’s it? Other possibilities?
The rash came first, caused the pneumonia. Nice.
All right. Let’s keep him on fluids and cefuroxime to be safe. And biopsy that rash. And take another history. Even if we don’t learn what’s causing this we definitely need to know if twelve-year-olds are getting any action. [His team leaves.]
Secret club. What’s the secret, they’re all morons?
Fungal pneumonia without the cave. Clever.
These young doctors. It’s like they don’t care about people. No manners.
That’s an interesting accent you have there. I’d say Czech, with about thirty years of Aussie.
You’re Chase’s dad. Hard to miss, you know, the big hug and how happy he was to see you. [He sips his coffee and smiles.]
Need a consult.
Urgent doctor stuff. [He leaves.]
26-year-old male, sudden loss of the ability to speak --
-- to his father. Differential diagnosis?
Dad swoops in, Chase swoops out.
See? You asked. Dad comes 5000 miles and you’re more curious than Junior is. Can’t just be about the divorce. It’s been fifteen years and mom’s been dead for ten of them. You think Daddy murdered her?
You want to know how two chemicals interact, do you ask them? No, they’re going to lie through their lying little chemical teeth. Throw them in a beaker and apply heat.
[calling after him] You know, words can hurt!
Hah, hah hah. [The team looks over to see House reading a book on rheumatology by Chase’s father.] Sorry, forgotten how funny your dad was.
High praise. I know how protective kids can be of their parents. [He hands his cane over to Chase and goes to look at the microscope.] Not cotton, animal hair. Get the CT scan. [The team crowds around the CT.] First, find the name of the company that made the insulation and second, tell me what I’m seeing that makes me want to short their stock.
Less obvious, more scary.
No, the cefuroxime would have killed some of it, clouded the result.
Anthrax. This house belonged to old man Hussein?
Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?
I want to know what Dr. Chase thinks.
Oh, I’m sorry! Not you. Understandable mistake. The other Dr. Chase. [Chase is not amused.]
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, it’s not a competition! It’s a diagnosis! Okay, who thinks [raising a hand over Chase’s head] Junior wins? [Everyone’s quiet.] Four to one, it’s not anthrax. So we start over, what’s changed? What do the nodules tell us?
Excellent. Send an ACE level. If it comes back positive, put him on methotrexate.
Come on, there’s no reason you both can’t be wrong. It’s not allergy, but it’s not coincidence, either. Disease number one set off disease number two.
And triggered a dormant sarcoidosis. Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax and start him on methotrexate for the sarcoidosis.
Better go with him. Make sure he doesn’t snap and hurt somebody. [Foreman follows him.]
Apparently not.
Is this a magic trick? Because I am a total David Copperfield fan, although that “Tornado of Fire,” that seemed a little fake –
Fascinating story. You thought of adapting it for the stage? [His beeper beeps, he goes to get it in his office.]
Go back to your son’s room.
There’s a problem. [Jeffrey walks out, and..]
No, he doesn’t. I rescheduled you guys so you’d be free.
You page me?
Oh, come on. We all need help now and again. [Cameron, Foreman and Rowan also enter.] You’re getting a consult. Okay, we’ve got new skin lesions, bigger and uglier. What would cause that?
Sure, except for the nodules and we’re not working out of Calcutta General.
Gotta go with Senior. He literally wrote the book on this one.
We’ll give it to him now, before the fat starts dripping out his eyeballs.
Your watch is on too tight. [Well, how about that! Patient crisis solved.]
Your relationship with your dad is messing with your ability to do your job.
Good point. Haven’t seen him in years, he flies across the Atlantic to see you –
You breeze by him like he’s a Hare Krishna at the airport. You don’t even ask why he’s in town.
Probably. I was hoping to do this by sheer manipulation, but if you insist on talking, fine, talk. [He walks over to the foot of the stairs.] What did he do to you?
I’d hate it. That’s why I cleverly have no personal life.
Good thinking! Prove your dad wrong. That’ll solve everything.
But the patient’s getting better.
On the other hand, getting better.
Better!
Be home by midnight or he can’t have the car this weekend. [Chase stops by the door.] You guys talk? Did he tell you why he’s here?
Going back to the conference?
I hope you can get in. You’re not registered. I get it. You had to make up a lie. Can’t just tell your kid you’re here to see him. What father does that? That little blue dot under your collar. [Rowan moves to cover it up.] It’s a tattoo for guiding radiation treatment. I was looking for it after I saw what you had for breakfast: brown rice and vegetables, macrobiotic diet. Popular with Hollywood starlets and cancer patients.
You look good.
What’d he say?
But you haven’t told Robert. You don’t want to burden him because you were such a lousy dad.
Yeah, it’s better. I’ll get to see his face when he reads his dad’s obituary.
I suppose it isn’t.
Well, luckily, at this rate, that should only last about a week. Okay, so –
Are you saying that for the chance of a beautiful family moment, or is there some medicine involved?
Too bad. I was hoping for the other reason. I was gonna go get my camera. Get a CT scan. His brain this time.
Why didn’t you tell me that Rowan Chase was in to see you?
You could have covered yourself. Called me in for a consult.
You can’t tell Chase, but I can. What should I do?
I promised I wouldn’t. My fingers were crossed, though, so I’m wide open.
Telling him, now that’s got real entertainment value.
Then I should definitely tell him! I’d want to know.
Oh, you never run out of thingies. Like that blonde thing you were chatting up.
Double-entry bookkeeping? [Elevator dings, because the elevator wins at comic timing.]
Billing procedures. They’re so complicated, aren’t they? [Wilson rolls his eyes as the doors close.]
Drs. Chase are 0 – 3. Even when they agree they’re wrong. So, next. What else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules?
Kid’s dad mentioned leishmaniasis.
Two diseases pretty much exclusive to Southeast Asia. What if the anthrax didn’t set off the second disease?
No. What if something else was the trigger?
We happened.
I’ve gotta pee. [He leaves.]
Nothing. [He grabs Jeffrey’s bad wrist.]
On a scale of one to ten, how painful?
Don’t do that. It’ll hurt you. Carpal tunnel surgery obviously didn’t work.
The little ones call me Uncle Gregg. Your dad never had carpal tunnel. You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase. How’d you know about them?
So, what’d you search for? “Diseases from Asia that don’t match my son’s symptoms”? You heard about them in Asia.
Well, you probably just forgot. Let me refresh your memory. Some remote, dusty village, close quarters, at least a year… starting to come back?
[to Gabe] Your dad’s pissed off. He should be. Comes here, expecting us to do an extra good job because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital –
Just telling him my job, my obligation to this –
There’s only one thing that you guys have got to do. Tell the truth, or your son will die. How long were you in Asia?
Clue number one: If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine.
Close, but no wafer. Clue number two: Rheumatology Rowan was almost right. It causes auto-immune symptoms.
It’s leprosy. Run a FITE stain, it’ll be positive. Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of Indian ashram.
It’s not dormant in the dad, it’s just slow. Damaged his ulnar nerve, was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel. Never trust doctors. Run a FITE stain.
Vicious circle. The leprosy made him vulnerable to the anthrax, and the anthrax treatment put the leprosy in overdrive.
Yeah, that’s where the trouble starts. [CGI shot of what House is talking about.] The antibiotics hit the nerve strands, they kill the leprosy bacteria. The corpses get tossed into the system. And as fascinating as our bodies are, they’re also stupid. They produce antibodies to beat dead bacteria. And these aren’t the polite antibodies, they’re the ones that won’t sit still; kick during naptimes. They attack his neural and fat cells, cause some inflammation and all the rest of his symptoms.
[to Cameron] I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana, home of the last leper colony in the lower 48. Get them to send up some thalidomide.
Twelve-year-olds don’t have sex, right? So he can’t be pregnant. Make the call. [to Rowan] I need to speak to your boy. [Chase is alone in the office with House.]
People like talking about people. Makes us feel superior. Makes us feel in control. And sometimes, for some people, knowing some things makes them care. [He takes some Vicodin.]
Cameron would. Me, I just like knowing stuff. [pause] I know you hate your dad, but I’m gonna tell you something –
Okay.
That’s it. [Chase leaves.]
32-year-old female, paralysis and severe pain in her right quad. Go.
She’s the CEO of Sonyo Cosmetics. Three assistants and fifteen VPs checked out who should be treating her. Who da man? I da man. I always suspected.
Stop talking.
You read one of those negotiating books, didn’t you? “Getting to Yes: Fifty Ways to Win an Argument.” “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Being a Pal.” In five seconds you just manipulated these two into agreeing with your point of view. [Chase and Foreman look defensive.] Fellas, this is known as “soft positional bargaining.” It’s not gonna work.
Chase, put her on blood thinners, do an angiogram. [Cameron looks triumphant.] When that comes back negative, MRI the spine. If that’s clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg.
Read less, more TV.
Say “ah”.
No, really belt it out, like you’re gonna throw up.
Perfect. Okay, that’s it. We should know in a couple of days what’s growing in your son’s throat. [The dad doesn’t say anything in response.] Hello?
Excuse me?
Right…
Right, yeah, well, that happens. You know, it’s very dangerous operating so close to the vocal chords. Okay, well, we’ll send your kid’s culture to the lab and somebody will call you. [As he’s leaving] BOO!
Just wanted to see if your dad, uh, sorry. [He leaves.]
I need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you. Like half your age.
Man oh man. Someone got spanked real good this morning.
Cure cancer. Is the hospital getting out of the dull business of treating patients?
I know exactly what he’s doing. He’s using us to run clinical trials.
[entering his office] It’s unethical. [Cuddy follows.] Oh, are you coming in, too? I thought I had you convinced.
He’s using patients as guinea pigs.
Are we a pharmaceutical company? We’re gonna wind up pressuring desperate patients into choices that are bad for them, good for us. You’re gonna compromise patient care.
What’s interesting is it suddenly doesn’t bother you.
He’s not going to kill a few patients. He’s going to kill this hospital.
[getting coffee] Make him a bundt cake. Patient hit a ten on the pain scale. What would explain that?
What about the muscle biopsy?
Oh, it’s storytime! Let me get my baba.
That’s absurd. I love it.
Which could, in turn, mean cancer. I’ll talk to Wilson. Next time, skip Aunt Elisa.
That’s why I’m talking to an oncologist.
Oh! I hadn’t heard.
Completely unethical.
No, I have seen every scary movie ever made. Six-year-old twins in front of an elevator of blood, boys’ choirs: those are bad omens. This is much more mundane: a billionaire wants to get laid.
And the reason you want respect?
Okay then. You’ve just gotta think like a billionaire. [Wilson smiles.] Let’s see, big scary changes, and then, “Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner to discuss your future on my G-5 private jet.”
Yes, I’m the big poobah, the big cheese, the go-to guy.
Relax, I’ve been through three regime changes in this hospital. Every time, same story.
It itches. [Wilson sighs and leaves. House calls after him.] So, are you going to do this bone scan for me or what?
Dr. Simpson! Did you hear? New management. I’m thinking about switching to orthopedics. How much do you guys get for massage now, without the happy ending?
You remember a guy named Van Der Meer? Not a big talker. You fixed his ACL.
Didn’t get hypertensive during surgery? No strokes? Maybe some connectivity loss?
I’m not involved. Guy brought his son into the clinic.
The son’s fine. Can’t shut him up. The dad show any signs of cortical disease? Wernicke’s?
He’s not saying “boo”.
Mr. Van Der Meer. [Dad is typing on his laptop.] What? [Dad types “wHats werong gwith ricky”] Relax, Ricky’s going to be just “finkf”. Strep throat, here’s a prescription for an antibiotic. He should be all better in a few days. Although, [House turns around wielding a needle] this might sting a little. [He approaches the dad, who looks frightened. House looks up to the ceiling, and when the dad looks up, House injects him in the neck.] I want to see you again real soon. [Evil smile!]
What happened to a regular old-fashioned colonoscopy?
Do you get that often? Women would rather die than get naked with you?
But not of tests. Just embarrassing ones.
It’s not an inflammatory process, it’s not a clot because Chase’s angio says so, and it’s not cancer because her toosh is perfect. Anybody else got an Aunt Elisa with weird stuff? [He looks at the angiogram.]
I thought you said Carly’s angio was clean.
You guys see the problem here? [Foreman gets up to get a closer look.]
Her toes are screwed up. They’re backwards. Do you guys know how much surgery it’s going to take to swap them back?
Either she literally has two left feet or you angio-ed the wrong leg.
Or maybe it was Jenny! How come some resident signed this radiology form? Were you even in the room?
You’ll do nothing! Foreman, you do the angiogram. [Foreman leaves.]
I’m thrilled. [Cameron leaves. House is still staring at the white board. While thinking, he twirls his cane, throws his ball…. He ends up erasing the board with Carly’s physical symptoms, and starts to write her psych symptoms.]
Carly needs a heart transplant.
Haven’t gotten it back yet.
Haven’t done the MUGA.
I got my aura read today. It said someone close to me had a broken heart.
I can’t tell you anything. Professional responsibility.
Not my professional responsibility, yours. New regime, you gotta keep your head down, too.
I’m not saying you want to, I’m saying you’d be obligated to.
I can’t.
I’ve come up with a few really great rationalizations. [Chase and Cameron walk up.]
She’s already on the list.
You need a heart transplant.
You cut yourself. Probably highly ritualized. You play the same Sarah MacLaughlin song over and over while you do it, probably works better than anti-depressants.
You’re a high-powered bulimic. You make yourself throw up. You have to find the most efficient way to vomit without revealing the tell-tale signs of bulimia, which is all, eugh. Very unseemly, for a CEO. So, you found a common antidote for accidental poisoning to do the job: ipecac. Which is great, if your kid’s just swallowed a bottle of aspirin, but really, really bad if it’s a habit. It causes muscle damage. It caused the pain in your leg. And it destroyed your heart. How often do you do it?
In about an hour, there’s going to be an emergency meeting of the transplant committee to discuss where you fall on the list should a new heart become available. Problem is, I am required to tell the committee of your bulimia, it’s a major psychiatric condition. Ranks right up there with suicidal, makes you a very bad risk.
Unless I lie to the committee. But if they find out, I lose my medical license. This would be a very good time to offer me a bribe. How much is your life worth, how much is my job worth –
I want to know what’s right.
Oh, stop hiding! [Carly looks taken aback at his yelling.] I’m asking you if you want to live or die, you can’t even say that!
Yes! I want you to tell me that your life is important to you, because I don’t know! [pause] Because that’s what’s on the table right now: your life. [He turns to leave; Carly grabs his arm.]
This 32-year-old female was admitted by my staff because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh. Patient rapidly deteriorated and now has severe congestive heart failure. Pressers and vasodilators have not improved her conditions whatsoever. Pulmonary function tests show an FVC of over 3 liters with EDD-1 of at least 90% of predicted. And preserved FEB/FEC ratio and preserved DLCO as well. [Ed note: These were rattled off so fast, I have no clue if the acronyms are right.] Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19% with no focal wall or motion abnormalities. Heart catheterization revealed clean left, right and circumflex arteries, and subsequent biopsy revealed irreversible cardiomyopathy. [wrapping up] Which is why we’re here.
I had a hunch.
Look, if the tests had come back differently, obviously I would have taken her off the lists, but on the long shot… [Vogler walks in and takes a seat on the sidelines] On the long shot I was right, I didn’t want to waste time.
CAT scan revealed no tumors and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.
No atherosclerotic vascular disease –
No pneumonia, no bacteriemia, no Hep-B or C or any other letters.
No alcohol, no drugs.
She’s a little blue, but turns out she needs a heart transplant. [Cuddy glances at Vogler, who gives her a pointed look.]
Dr. Cuddy, do you have any reason to think that I would lie?
[looks at Wilson and Vogler before answering] No.
Beautiful organ donor weather.
I never lie.
Then you should have voted against putting her on the list.
Oh, jeez. Have some backbone. If you think I’m wrong, do something.
You value our friendship more than your ethical responsibilities.
My patient’s getting a heart.
They’re all – oh, the guy who can’t talk.
Oooh, goody.
It’s bad enough that screw-ups cost lives. Now we’ve got Vogler, screw-ups cost jobs. I want Chase scared. I want him doing everything he can to protect his job.
Oh, will you stop it with the book! Why are you doing this?
You’re manipulating everyone.
They like you. Everyone likes you. [He starts to walk away.]
No.
[looking at his watch] 5 hours, 23 minutes, that’s fast.
It depends. Either surgery went really well, or it ended really abruptly.
Thank you.
So, sing for me. [Dad looks at House, and then grabs his laptop.] Oh, no, no, no, no… come on, look. When you had your surgery, you were intubated. Surgeon stuck a tube down your throat. Now, it never happens, and it’s never caught, but it happens. Your vocal chords were paralyzed. I treated the spastic dysphonia with Botox. Ironically, a substance that tightens every other corner of your face actually loosens the tongue. I have healed you. You can talk. [Dad shakes his head.] Oh, well. [House goes to leave, and as he does…] BOOOO! [Dad grasps his laptop in fear, but no scream.] Okay, you don’t have to say anything, it can be our little secret. If you can talk, blink twice. [Dad stares at House.] But you’re not going to, because you think you won’t be entitled to the money you won in the settlement with Simpson. Yesterday I would have said you’d have to give the money back. Today… hospital’s come into a lot of money, mum’s the word. [Dad blinks twice, and House smiles. Dad smiles back, and all is cheery in Exam Room one.]
Hey.
I know the cardiologist has given you some guidelines, schedule of medications, and a strict diet: just what someone with an eating disorder needs. So, I thought I’d get you started. [He grabs a Styrofoam take-out container.] Fried chicken from the Carnegie Deli.
Yeah. Actually, I got it downstairs. [Carly laughs a bit.]
You’re my patient. Don’t screw it up. [Carly nods, and House leaves.]
[over the music] Love this part! [switches to air drums, and… Vogler turns off his music] Okay. He ruined it.
I am sorry about the lab coat thing. The dry cleaners destroyed it. [Vogler laughs and sits.]
Trust me. Six Flags, way more exciting.
Sweet of you to say.
Oh, my. If only I’d known.
Yes, I don’t envy the transplant committee their responsibility. They basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl. I’m not sure I could have done that.
No. This is actually more like we’re dancing right now, so let’s get to the point. You don’t like me. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to like you. It’s nothing personal, I don’t like anybody. But none of that really matters, does it, because you’ve got money, and I’ve got tenure. You need full board approval to get rid of me. I’ve got Cuddy.
And Wilson. So, as long as we’re stuck with each other, we might as well ignore each other. [He turns on the iPod and out comes “Hava Nagila”. The music is quickly turned off.] That wasn’t nearly as dramatic as I was hoping.
Need the lawyer.
Nobody, but it’s not even lunch. Got served with a federal court order. Some witness went into a coma and they want me to take a look at it. [He tries to hand the paper over to Cuddy, but Vogler snatches it.]
I’m a doctor, I’m not a lapdog for the feds; I don’t play fetch.
[grabs the papers back] Jail. You’d like that. No more naughty schoolgirl. [to Vogler] Conjugal visit, that’s her new fantasy. [Vogler tries not to laugh as House leaves.]
He’s really out of it, huh?
Rule out poisoning.
No, the first guess was faking it. Patient’s a federal witness, reluctant, I’m assuming. He’s also an 8 on the Glasgow coma scale.
They tell me no, but do an MRI to be sure. [They round the corner to Diagnostics, Bill is standing by the door.]
Check for everything, feds are paying. We’re gonna turn a profit on this one, boys.
Do I come to you with my problems?
What, you changed your name? “Smith” wasn’t good enough for you?
He’s important to you, got it. So, no placebos for him, we’ll use the real medicine. [Elevator dings, House gets in.] Well, this was fun, let’s do it again soon. [Bill follows him in.] Brother in the Mafia? [Door closes, because the elevator door has the best sense of dramatic/comedic timing in the whole show.] So, just Joey? I was hoping for a nickname. Joey Mango. Joey the Wrench. [Bill hits the emergency stop.] People know where I am.
We’re a bit of a specialized hospital. We generally only deal with patients when they’re actually sick.
So, on the Mafia thing, that’s a yes.
[looking at the scan] These look like pseudomembranes. Those take time to form. If it was an old injury it wouldn’t have caused the coma.
What about his liver?
The neurologist thinks it’s his brain, wants to open up his head. Frankly, I’m shocked! You get to use the big boy drill and Daddy’s big red toolbox.
I’m not releasing him.
Or because he had an unexplained coma, which sounds better?
That’s a catchy diagnosis, you could dance to that.
Cameron’s my girl.
Are you disagreeing with me because –
Of course it is. But unless I’ve been named as the fourth part of the Axis of Evil, invaded and occupied, this is still not a democracy. He’s staying. Send for Hepatitis serologies and an autoimmune panel. [He enters the clinic.]
Hey. I’m with you. Old enough to drink, old enough to do something really stupid and make yourself a baby.
[listing to the kid’s breathing with his stethoscope] Whistling, technically. Upper airways, nose.
Absolutely. [He leans over the kid.]
I doubt it.
No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away. [He retrieves a tiny toy policeman from the kid’s nose.] Hello, officer. You might want to rinse this off before you let him play with it again. [His beeper beeps.]
What happened? Where is he?
And who called Vogler? [All the ducklings look at each other.]
You had no authority to release my patient.
From what you understand? He’s not your patient; how the hell do you understand anything?
You’re not even a doctor.
Why bother, just to piss me off?
Okay. [turns to leave]
Okay, sir. Carry on. [He leaves.]
So, your junior G-man badge isn’t looking so good.
Comatose?
Hep-C is a chronic condition. You don’t think this is an acute situation?
Except for the suddenness of the onset.
You get home one night. Your wife hits you with a baseball bat. Likely cause is the fact you haven’t thanked her for dinner in eight years, or the receipt for fur handcuffs she found in your pants. Sudden onset equals proximate cause.
One test. What do his other liver tests tell us?
Because she’s cuter. [Cameron looks uncomfortable.] Though it’s close. Do a liver biopsy. When the results come back we’ll know what we’re looking at.
Right. Then he gets to testify, and you get a gold star from Cuddy.
Do I have a reason for not wanting you to get any stars? [Everyone looks confused.] Fine, start the treatment. It’s all your idea. Don’t even mention my name. There’s nothing wrong with your theory, go. [They all get up.] But in the “humor me” department, get a biopsy while you’re at it. [They start to leave.] Foreman, we need to talk. [House and Foreman enter House’s office.] You’re off the case.
Somebody told Vogler that I lied to the transplant committee.
You’re too careful. You wouldn’t jump ship unless you knew what was in the water.
But I want Vogler to think I think it’s you. And I want Cameron and Chase and Cuddy and Wilson and the nursing staff and the cashier in the parking lot to think that, too.
Took another homework break with Betty Lou?
Pulled a quarter out of his nose. It’s a classic.
Got a crisis here!
It’s a neat trick.
Ah.
What, they put romano in the parmesan cheese shaker again?
Those idiots. How many times am I going to have to send them through sensitivity training? Nobody’s saying he’s a homo, that would be really, really bad. So let’s put a nice, friendly spin on it. Let’s go with: he got raped in prison. I saw the jailhouse tats, put it together with the blood tests…
You’re worried about how his coworkers will react in the Walmart in Des Moines.
Listen, I don’t know if you know about this, but mob businesses sometimes keep two sets of books.
Exactly.
Doctors are busy, sometimes they forget to write things down, it happens all the time.
I doubt it.
On your way to polish Vogler’s car?
How will I eat?
Floor polish costs through the roof?
My car has been stolen. [They look around for it, and see…]
[smiling] You know, they’re gangsters, sure, but they’re thoughtful, too.
No, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Graft is if I tell them I’ll only make him better if he slips me a couple bucks. A payoff for something I’m not supposed to do. If I’d asked for the payoff (which I didn’t), I would have done the bad thing anyway. So there’s nothing wrong with this.
Damn. ’65. Perfectly restored. What do you think a guy like Joey would do if someone turned down a gift? That’s kind of an insult, isn’t it?
I’m screwed. Gotta take the car.
[entering] Biopsy’s back. Two findings. Number one: lymphocytic infiltrate and no bridging fibrosis.
Who said that? I forget. What are you doing here? I told you you were off the case.
Well, it’s clearly not going to work now.
If we knew that, then we wouldn’t need a diabolic plan now, would we?
No, you guys love me too much.
Finding number two: toxins.
He’s a 30-year-old mobster. He doesn’t have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins, he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins. Someone’s poisoned him.
Whatever this toxin is, it’s doing its job and fast. How long do we have until the next round of test results?
There is another way. Relax, it’s kosher.
Anything?
Is he a smoker?
Early signs of emphysema. He's been smoking at least a dozen years.
Nope, got that from the chest x-ray. White count just tells me he's quitting. [He goes to look over Cameron's shoulder, who looks uncomfortable.]
Cancel the thumb screws, I’ve got our culprit.
Not who, Hu.
Thanks for playing along. Chai Hu, a Chinese herb in his quit smoking candy. Reduces cravings, also reduces his white blood count. Oh yeah, he also took enough of them to poison himself. We’ll keep him on the pig for a few more hours, then take him off the candy, he’ll be fine. Pig won’t be. Oh no.
I’ll keep him overnight, then let the feds know he’s good to rat out whoever he wants.
Maybe have to give back the car.
Why?
He humiliated himself.
The ’66 came with a Shut Up button.
It is my medical opinion that the patient is healthy and can be released.
You’re having a meeting?
Not by themselves, but in combination with the Interferon it’s like gas to a flame.
For the Hep-C.
Oops.
Is letting the feds know everything that important? [House’s beeper beeps.]
Ed!
Joey’s back in a coma.
Question is, why? It’s not his brain, it’s not a toxin. Our friend Babe helped with that one. So what else?
Am I going to have to write a song about it? His chronic Hep-C was not bad enough to produce these symptoms.
Indicates something else entirely.
[as the three others start to leave] What else could cause his estrogen level to be that high?
Pretty sure you didn’t.
Thus forcing him to shove a big one up there. [Kid is still crying.] Stop or I snap your nose off! [And the kid stops crying! House pulls… a fire truck out of his nose, which goes with the policeman and the firefighter.]
Genetics is a powerful force. On the other hand, maybe he’s smarter than you think.
Just give me a second. Always wanted to use one of these. [He grabs a big magnet, and demonstrates its use by picking scissors up off of the counter.] Tilt his head back.
Just tilt his head back. [He uses the magnet, and a metal cat comes out of the kid’s nose.] Nice grasp of concepts, relationships. Very smart, very cool. First the policeman, fireman, fire truck. Your brother was sending in teams to save the cat.
Sometimes the simplest answer… [ He trails off in thought, and Occam’s Razor strikes again!]
Most types of coma you just don’t snap out of. [Chase enters.]
Yes, I have. A very simple one.
It’s private.
You’re currently top of the list. Toxic comas, person’s away from the cause long enough and they recover.
It’s not a poison, then.
How about a food sensitivity?
Problem is, if I can’t trust you, I can’t trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you’ve been a big help.
So where did you get the money?
Someone paid you off.
You’re talking about poison. I’m talking about payoff. Graft.
You paid the marshal off.
No, it just worked out that way.
Better than fish sticks? I’m thinking steak.
He had steak before both comas. Your brother has Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency. You want me to write it down? Good, because it takes a while. It’s genetic, it can present at any time. The patient eats a large amount of protein, especially if he’s not used to it.
Yes. If I’m right, and we stop the current treatment, he gets better. If we stop the current treatment and I’m wrong, he dies.
His estrogen level. OTD doesn’t explain his estrogen level. But I have a theory. There is one chemical that, if ingested, can cause a person’s estrogen level to increase dramatically. [He sits in the waiting area.]
It’s called estrogen.
No, nothing like that. It’s called Male Flame. It’s probably more consumer friendly in the original Chinese. It’s an herbal aphrodisiac marketed to gay men.
And sold on the same website that sells his Chai Hu lozenges. Guess what’s in it? Starts with an “e”.
That would be quite a trick. “He slapped me so hard his brother turned straight.” Joey’s a big-time mobster. Guys like that don’t get raped in prison. They get gifts, they get food, drugs, cigarettes, cable TV…
Well, maybe not gay, but certainly delightful. You, on the other hand, hitting a doctor, even if it was only Chase… and asking another one to keep his chart fresh and homo-free. Well, that’s a bit of an overreaction, wouldn’t you say? It’s almost like you’re scared that it might be true.
Okay. Then don’t stop the treatment. [starts to leave] But if you’re wrong, he dies.
That’s what I love about you mob guys: so tolerant of others, so accepting. Only way he was coming out was way, way out. Lose the tattoos, change his name, move to another town… how’s a guy like him going to do that? Witness protection. It’s not just for witnesses any more.
Good thing you fought for me, though, right? The dress was a nice move, but you’ve got to follow it up. Nasty weekend in Vegas, something that shows off your real administrative skills. [He pops a Vicodin.]
I’m sorry. So, how long do I have? I’ve a lot of personal stuff to pack up. I assume you’re going to want to throw a party.
He’s only keeping you on because you know the secret handshakes. He’s a quick study. Six months, he’ll have the moves down. Then he won’t need you any more.
So I stay.
Profits. New world order.
Everything’s about profits.
That would be easy, and it would be wrong.
To a point.
I gotta do six more clinic hours a month. So do two of them. [nods to the Ducklings on the other side of the wall]
‘Cause one of them’s gone. I gotta fire somebody. [House walks into the office, leaving behind a shocked Wilson. House and Wilson share a look through the glass before Wilson moves on and House starts the day with his team and trusty whiteboard.] Good morning.
You ever see an infected pierced scrotum?
Well, if pain’s what you’re after the penis is really the way to go.  I’d recommend the apadravya.
Oh?  Sounded like we were.
Nipples?
Absolutely.  As soon as I do performance reviews.  And then review the reviews, of course.  Because a decision like this can’t be made without proper, you know, review.  Shouldn’t take longer than a month, maybe two. Four at the most, unless it gets complicated.
Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape and gauze it’s a human being.
Like you don’t.  [The elevator opens, revealing Cameron.]
Don’t know him.
What’s the problem?
Definitely don’t know him.
Right.  The simplest explanation is she’s a forty-year-old lying about her age.  Maybe an actress trying to hang on.
That’s what five pediatricians, two nutritionists, and a psychologist said.  The heart attack would seem to indicate that they missed something.
Could, if her blood pressure was high enough.
It fits the symptoms.  Me likee.  Do a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.  [They get up to leave.]  Oh, and one more thing.  I’ve been told that I’ve got to get rid of one of you guys by the end of the week.  New sheriff, belt tightening, you know how it goes.  Okay, carry on. [He goes into his office.]
Burning?
Hmm, sounds almost like heartburn.
Like a thesaurus?
I take it you never mentioned this during any of your prenatal visits.
Sorry, you don’t get to make that call unless you have a stethoscope.  Union rules.
Vasectomies can reverse themselves, condoms break.
You have little people inside you.  [Lucille grabs her purse and heads to the door.]  Okay, okay, I’m sorry.  I guess I must have just been brainwashed by the media, and all those years of medical training.
Let’s see if I can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood.
The heartburn, gotta make sure it’s not spreading.
On what?  Sharon’s plan for Gaza?
I’m thinking I can convince Vogler it would be more cost-efficient to let me keep all of them.
It will be more cost-efficient once I’ve grabbed Cameron’s ass, called Foreman a spade, and Chase… well, I can grab his ass, too.
Together.  [House leaves Wilson to pay for lunch.]
You’re wrong.  She is, in fact, pathetically sincere.  And they didn’t screw it up.
I’m from the lab.  The blood tests showed your daughter wasn’t hypoglycemic, which means her psychosis wasn’t caused by anything these doctors did.
I have no idea, but you’ll be happy to hear it can’t be cured by diet or exercise.
What else could cause uncontrollable rage in a ten-year-old?
I assume I don’t have to point out that now would be an extremely good time for one of you to distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea.
She hasn’t had liposuction.
But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment?
Diet pills can cause heart attacks and blood clots.
Wouldn’t show over-the-counter weight loss drugs.
She’s lying.  Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prevent further clotting.  And you, [to Foreman] find those pills.
[shaking the bottle of Vicodin] Not diet pills.  You might want to broaden the search just a little.  And don’t just ask the mom, if she hasn’t mentioned yet, she’s not gonna –
So what should I do?
Yes, I had noticed your complete indifference.  You don’t even offer a medical opinion any more.  Who would you fire?
I want your opinion.  [Foreman starts to leave.]  Fine, it’s you.  [Foreman turns around.]  Either way, you’re making a choice.
[slightly puzzled]  Wh- Because he screwed up an angio a month ago?
Right, it’s the money.  You resent it, but you’re going to tell me he doesn’t need the job.
He was ready to go three rounds with Cameron for it.
I’m surprised.
I didn’t think you’d pick at all.
I guess he’s not the “rise above the fray” guy he likes to think he is.
He’s scared of losing his job, just like everyone else.
I am not miserable. [They enter the clinic.]
And you are?
I am exactly where I want to be doing exactly what I want to do.
[looking at charts]  Hmmm… I was wrong.
Mrs. Hernandez’s pregnancy tests.
Either a woman carrying an alien baby or your newest patient.  [Wilson grabs the chart.]
It’s actually a personal record for this clinic.
You wear a bikini now?
Nope, but I’ve never gone swimming with you.
Yeah, that’s exactly why I planted a thirty pound tumor on your ovary.
[nodding] Yeah, it was.
Yeah, I’m sure that if everyone I knew hated me, I couldn’t bear to look at me.  I wouldn’t go so far as to shoplift.
[stuttering] Wait!  Are you going to let him say that?  He insulted our basketball teams!  [Foreman’s beeper beeps, then Chase’s, then Cameron’s… they all have different beeps that sound quite nice together, but that’s not the point of this.]
Or both.  Diet pills brought her to us, we gave her the sores.
I’m not saying the hospital gave the sores, I’m saying we did.  By treating her.  Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.
Who gave her the heparin?
Sure you didn’t both give her warfarin?
[to Chase] Did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin? [pregnant pause] Enough said.
None that I can think of.  Let’s fix the mistake.  Give her unfractionated IV heparin and low molecular weight heparin by subcutaneous injection stat.  [Cameron, Chase, and Foreman leave into the hallway.]
[shouting out the door] Hey!  Stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the patient’s.
Brrrr.  Icy.  Definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again.
Right, I always forget that part.
Yet.  [pause]  If you didn’t screw up, then what is it?  You don’t have an answer.
When you come up with something, let me know.  I’ll be in the clinic, warming up.
Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?
I’m sorry, you said you weren’t angry.  Who would you fire?
Not an option.
Figures you’d try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt.  The problem is, the world doesn’t work that way just ‘cause you want it to.
Uh, he’s not in today.
He’s also got a bit of a drug problem.  Sometimes doesn’t show up for weeks.  [He walks into Cuddy’s office.]
Yes.  I’m going to cut the pay of all four of us.  17% across the board will allow you to keep us all for the same amount of money.  I believe it’s what you suits call “win-win”.
It’s not about the money.
Even if I was Dr. House, physician-patient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations.
Yeah?  She also tell you why she’s refusing to have it removed?
You want her to regain the weight?
Why?
Yeah, tell her that and leave me alone.
The tumor is benign, nothing’s gonna happen.  Except maybe some more heartburn.
You know where to find us.  Building’s not going anywhere.
Oh, way to win me over.
You have kids!  How novel!  That changes everything.  So if Mommy has heartburn, one of them might catch on fire.
They are cute.  Have her come back in.
Your plight has moved me. [Elevator dings.]  Tell your wife to come back.
Have you found the right thing?
Then we continue the treatment.  Hope it’s just taking longer than it should.
Or who.
Do it.
What, no roses, no chocolates?  If you’re here to apologize –
Uh-oh, that means you’re here for something more complicated.  [He takes Vicodin.]
Yes.  I was just waiting for an excuse.  Thank God Vogler came along.  Phew!
Really?  Because there is another explanation. [He stands up.]  Perhaps not as much fun as your Freudian analysis, but maybe you actually made a mistake.
I believe that you are the only one to express feelings.  And if we’re going to look at this from a first-year psych point-of-view, maybe you want me to fire you.  Maybe that’s why you’re acting weird.  You –
I have the answer.
Maybe you should.  [Cameron leaves, making the door shake behind her.]
Men are pigs.
I should have realized the vasectomy and condoms was overkill, but this was too obvious.  [He holds up Mr. Hernandez’s photos.]  Cute kids.  Love her green eyes.  And his baby blues.  Of course, since you and your husband have brown eyes…
From the father of three, maximum four of your six children.  So I’m thinking maybe the reason you don’t want surgery is, while your husband may find you attractive no matter what, all the other men you’re sleeping with might not be so open-minded.  Which brings me back to my original thesis: men are pigs.  You got nothing to worry about.  You know, pretty much have sex with anyone, fat, skinny, married, single, complete strangers, relatives –
So are you.  I’m sure there are websites full of men looking for married women with surgical scars.  [He hands her back the pictures.]  So have the surgery.  Please?
It’s been almost three hours, still no change in her condition.
Assume that Cameron didn’t screw up.  What if it’s not the warfarin?
Right, right, right, but let’s just say it’s not.  Come on, come on, what have you got?
No, there’s no time to think!  Say the first thing that comes to you head.
We already considered obesity as a cause.
Okay, so what could cause obesity and skin necrosis?  Listen, I don’t care if it makes sense, just give me something.
No, that’s just sores, not obesity.
More sores.  Okay, let’s look at it from the other side.  What has obesity as a symptom?
She’s not just heavy.  She’s tall.  We have any history on the dad?
Kid’s short.  We’ve got stunted growth, high blood pressure, blood clots, obesity – it’s Cushing’s.
In rare cases Cushing’s can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin.  It’s perfect.  It explains everyting.
The hypercortisolism could be cyclical, we just didn’t catch it in the right phase.
There’s no time!  We’ve got less than an hour to make the call.
Do an MRI.
No, I want you to look for what could cause hypercortisolism with an MRI.
Actually, it’s over a week.  Where have you guys been?
Chase.
The deal was –
No.
Yeah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose.
Uh huh, three minutes that I could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages.
[closes the door] Nope. I never liked Cameron or Foreman.
Fine. I’ll hold the Senator’s hair while he upchucks.
I don’t do speeches. I’m shy.
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals… wait a second, don’t I own that company? Oh, no, that’s right, you do.
I know its price tag is significantly improved.
[mutters as he leaves] Viopril…
Helps me concentrate. [Puts down Nintendo, picks up Vicodin.] Even better than drugs. [He pops one to demonstrate.]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tongues heal too fast. Your political consultants have written you a nice story. In a tight race the lispers alone could put you over the top.
I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.
You’re a black kid from the ghetto who made it to Yale Law and the United States Senate. That’s a sufficiently mythical story, you don’t need to lie about your tongue. [Foreman has been checking the Senator’s reflexes; the left leg was okay, but the right didn’t move.] Must have missed it.
It’s not the food. It’s your brain. [to Foreman] Get an MRI and a lumbar puncture. [to Wright] Cancel your travel plans.
I guess we can tell him he’s fairly healthy and can go home.
Care to bet your job on that? [Chase makes a face.] What was that?
You got annoyed. That was clearly an annoyed face.
But last week you didn’t get annoyed, you made poopie in your pants. It’s weird, it’s almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about.
None of you has anything to worry about.
Vogler saw the error of his ways and repented. The lesion could be nothing. It could also be a brain tumor or infection. There’s only one way to find out which.
Dangerous, I know. Especially as he’s a politician, his brain’s all twisted. But I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call surgery, get it scheduled. [He leaves.]
You’re not pregnant. [He hands her some tissues.]
Sure. You were pregnant. Based on your hormone levels, you had a miscarriage.
[charting] Right, since it’s physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner.
Fine, have it your way. Immaculate conception.
Well, it’s obvious. Start a religion. [He leaves. As he walks out, Cuddy storms past him.
[to the clinic nurse, conspiratorially] Afternoon delight. She just loves the hard wood. [House enters Cuddy’s office.]
Where’d you get that?
Oh, just so I’m clear, if he was a janitor, that would be okay. Do you have a list?
Uh huh, whereas tumors are really good for brains, make ‘em grow big and strong. It’s my call.
You’re pulling rank on patient care?
Either it’s a tumor or it’s an infection that the lumbar puncture didn’t pick up. Either way, if we don’t treat it immediately, it could kill you.
Wow, excellent question. Many doctors wouldn’t have gone there.
Mmm, but you’d only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your own ass.
Insulting, yes.
This could leave you b-b-b-b-brain damaged, and you’re worried about NASCAR dads?
It’s not a bacterial infection, either.
If that were true, would Dr. Wilson’s mouth be contorted into that ugly little shape?
Which means the Great Black Hope has full-blown AIDS. They’re gonna love that in Dubuque.
If you have toxo in your brain, you have AIDS.
This is very bad news. I get that, and I sympathize. But we’ve gotta speed through the denial phase because you need antiretrovirals and you need them fast. [He hands the pills to Senator Wright.]
But the toxo drugs are going to piss off your fungi, and when fungi get pissed – [Senator Wright throws the pills.]
You’re afraid word will leak out. Trust me, you’re not going to become President either way. They don’t call it the White House because of the paint job.
But when I really believe in something… Gosh dang it, I’ve got a chance to make a difference here.
It’s all the rage. Everybody’s doing it. [Chase gives House a petty, pouty look and goes to sulk in a chair. Cameron walks over to House.]
One speech, no biggie. Foreman’s doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer.
Cancer sounds better on a press release. I need you guys to rush the ELISA test for HIV. [He starts to walk into his office.]
When I said rush, I meant, you know, fast. Stat’s the word you doctors use, right?
Double stat? [Chase pats Cameron on the arm to follow him out, which she does.]
You’re welcome, again.
Got it. You’re grateful. Apparently you seem to think it’ll mean a lot to me to know that.
I thought you didn’t believe in God.
Well, then you better be making a very good point.
Are you comparing me to God? I mean, that’s great, but just so you know, I’ve never made a tree.
You are the most naïve atheist I’ve ever met.
Thank God. [He walks off, but turns around.] People pray so that God won’t crush them like bugs. I’m not gonna crush you.
Gosh, the internet is such a wonderful tool.
Definitely possible. The more likely diagnosis is hickey.
[exasperated] Why is everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?
I say you’re having sex, you say you’re not. Either you’re lying, or I’m wrong. Or there’s some middle ground.
I mean you’re having sex without knowing it. I’m testing you for booze, drugs and GHB.
The date rape drug. [He leaves.]
It’s positive. [He hands the Senator the water and some pills.] Your T-cell count is eight, which means there’s a good chance you’ll die. I’m telling you this because we need to contact your sexual partners.
You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom?
Some day there will be a black president. Some day there will be a gay president. Maybe there will even be a gay, black president. But one combination I do not see happening is gay, black, and dead. You need to stop lying to me.
Oh, cut the crap, you’re dying.
I take chances all the time, it’s one of my worst qualities.
Wanting to believe the best about people doesn’t make it true.
Well, that’s very moving. It’s a shame I don’t vote.
I need to draw some more blood.
That’s not surprising.
Why are you spying on my case?
And you don’t see a problem with that?
You’re not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.
That I’ve been ordered to give.
Don’t care.
Because I’m a very high-strung little lapdog. [as he enters the elevator] Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff! [Cuddy looks faintly disgusted.]
[standing in the back of the room] Nuh uh. No pills.
The antiretrovirals aren’t working.
Because you don’t have AIDS. [The Senator laughs.] The first test was a false positive. Happens one time in every five thousand.
Yeah. You’re still dying. The only difference is now we don’t know why.
So Cuddy can’t find us. Unless we find out the underlying disease, this guy’s lied to his last constituent.
Ran it twice.
No history of respiratory problems.
Idiopathic, from the Latin meaning we’re idiots ‘cause we can’t figure out what’s causing it. [He takes a Vicodin.] Give him a whole body scan.
‘Cause they’re useless. Could probably scan everyone of us and find five different doodads that look like cancer. But, when you’re 4th-down, 100 to go, in the snow, you don’t call a running play up the middle. Unless you’re the Jets. [He walks away.]
Standard procedure.
I knew he was going to Africa and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep A and B. That could cause a false positive.
I should have ordered both.
He said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.
Well, he didn’t have any reason to lie –
Is that why you haven’t put the moves on her?
You have restored my faith in the human race. You’re lying.
I just got your results back. No GHB, no nothing. It means you’re having sex, and you’re lying about it.
It’s a carpet burn.
Is something upsetting you?
We have a sleep lab in the basement. If nothing else, it’ll get you away from your ex for a night.
How slightly?
Sure, or he’s had a cold in the last six months. [to Chase] What, you’ve got her on speed dial?
Spontaneous bleeding, it’s benign. I was rooting for a really cool tumor, instead we’re stuck with this crap.
Well, knock yourselves out. [Vogler enters.]
Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan? A man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year.
Fourteen pages. The audience will be comatose by paragraph two.
Dr. Chase. We need to talk.
How do you see this ending?
I can’t fire you, so you have no reason to fear me, and therefore no reason to lie to me. You told Cuddy where I was. You told Vogler what I was doing. [pause]
So how can I work with you?
I am selling my soul.
I said I was selling it. I didn’t say I was giving it away. That would be immoral, and stupid. All they’ve done is added antacid.
That’s not the point!
He’s not asking me to do anything.
His left armpit node has antibodies for CB 11.
We never tested for hairy-cell leukemia.
Size isn’t everything. The spleen is the mother lode for hairy-cells. Let’s cut it open.
Why do you do this to me? Now, if I kill him, I can’t tell the judge I had no idea of the risks involved.
See, that’ll sound much better in court. Okay, go tell our human pincushion we’ll be sticking him one more time. [As they all leave -- ] Cuddy. Don’t you hate doing this?
You like me. Why?
Just trying to figure out what makes you tick. I am not warm and fuzzy and you are basically a stuffed animal made by grandma.
[muttering] Oh God, don’t try and pick me apart.
[standing by the window.] You know, when the Inuit go fishing, they don’t look for fish. [Every looks at House for a bit, but he remains silent.]
They look for the blue heron, because there’s no way to see the fish. But if there’s fish, there’s gonna be birds fishing. Now, if he’s got hairy-cell, what else are we gonna see circling overhead?
We can test for them. Run the titers.
These were your brain waves at 2:45 AM. Now, here it comes, there’s an abrupt jump from slow-wave sleep. This indicates partial sleep arousal. The most common type is somnambulism – sleepwalking.
Yes, and also why you were pregnant. And the hickies. And the carpet burn.
Sexsomnia is a documented disorder. You said your ex lives downstairs –
Okay, but he probably didn’t know that you were asleep. Sexsomniacs can act pretty normal. I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-dose antidepressant. It’ll let you sleep better. If you want to save yourself the $15 co-pay, you can have sex while you’re awake.
You live in the same building, you haven’t had sex with anyone else for a year, you sleepwalk right into his arms. Call me crazy, but I’m sensing unresolved issues.
You’ve got an opinion, too?
You’re welcome. He’s positive for Epstein-Barr.
You didn’t fall off the swings when you were eight.
Ever.
Uh uh. We have to talk. You had an epileptic seizure. That’s how you bit your tongue.
What medication did you take?
Yeah, that’s it. Don’t worry about what the question is, don’t worry that you’re starting to feel dizzy, just stay on message.
Phenytoin?
Senator Gary H. Wright of New Jersey had childhood epilepsy. He took phenytoin. That drug, with the Epstein-Barr virus, is associated with common variable immunodeficiency disease. T-cells down, B-cells down, it keeps you from forming enough antibodies. See, antibodies are basically your defensive line. [Cut to CGI shot describing what House is saying… minus the sports players.] And your brain is like the quarterback. And then the fungi are like blitzing linebackers, plunging up the middle. Your lungs are like… okay, you’ve got two quarterbacks –
Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea when you said it. Then he got the respiratory problem and tested positive for Epstein-Barr.
Another reason why Chase’s suggestion was idiotic. He got it when he was a kid. Didn’t get any symptoms until now, it happens. It gets triggered by stress, like public speaking.
Start the senator on IV immunoglobulin stat. If he gets better, I’m right, if he dies, you’re right.
You faked that.
Say “antiretroviral”.
Now say it three times fast.
Well, why not run for pope while you’re at it?
If they were running today they wouldn’t stand a chance.
No, there’s things I can’t do, and like you said, I have to live with reality.
Then why run?
[reading off a paper, very monotone] Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals’ extraordinary commitment to research excellence is exemplified by their new ACE inhibitor, a breakthrough medical approach that will protect millions from heart disease. [He looks up at the crowd, stuffs the paper in his pocket, and starts to walk away. The PPTH team gives looks of “That was it?”]
I thought it was pithy. You got enough for a press release, anyhow.
A few things I forgot to mention. Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessman. A brilliant judge of people, and a man who has never lost a fight. You know how I know the new ACE inhibitor is good? Because the old one was good. The new one is really the same, it’s just more expensive. [Vogler does not look happy.] A lot more expensive. See, that’s another example of Ed’s brilliance. [At this point, Wilson looks mildly interested, Cuddy looks mad, and Chase and Cameron look like the world’s about to end.] Whenever one of his drugs is about to lose its patent he has his boys and girls alter it just a tiny bit and patent it all over again. Making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars. Which is good for everbody, right? [Cuddy is now shaking her head in disbelief, and Wilson is staring pointedly.] The patients, pish. Who cares, they’re just so damn sick! God obviously never liked them anyway. [Cuddy = furious; Wilson = facepalm. Chase downs his whole glass of wine, and Cameron is staring at the table’s centerpiece.] All the healthy people in the room, let’s have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler! [House claps, Foreman shakes his head, the rest of the room stays silent. Vogler, well, he doesn’t look happy at all. As House hands Vogler the paper -- ] I threw in a joke.
I’m sorry. I should have taken a couple of extra Vicodin and just held my nose.
True.
Why? Is this another noble, self-sacrificing gesture? You trying to protect Foreman?
So this is just, “Don’t fire me, I quit.”
You have a Stage 4 cancer.  It’s metastasized to your liver.  [Vogler looks shocked.]  There’s a new drug called 8C 12 that’s shown promise in Phase 2 trials.  It’s your best shot.
Well, I did publicly bash your company’s drug.
Oh, hey, come on.  [House gets up and walks to behind Vogler, sans cane and limp.  He rests his hands on Vogler’s shoulders.]  There, there, there.  [Vogler sniffles.]
Always.  But just in case, I special-order an extra jumbo-size coffin.
Don’t thank me.  It’s just who I am.
Sorry, up late.  Internet porn.
Because there is a computer in my office.  If I log on, romance will ensue.  My wrist might fall off.
I don’t like loud, angry giants threatening me with violence.  How is that pathetic?
[getting a drink] I’m okay with later.
Three miscarriages?  Gimme.  [takes the file]
Tox screen?
For incontinence.
Pregnancy-related autoimmunity.  Too bad that Cameron quit, I could use an immunologist right now.  We’ll see if you’re right; check the blood.
Last night.  And do an MRA for vasculitis, too.
An ultrasound?  Excellent thought!  And put her on magnesium, too, in case it is preeclampsia.  [He takes a Vicodin.]
It’s not a cold.  [hands the baby back to Rachel]  It’s pneumonia.
Relax, pneumonia’s her second-biggest problem.  She has gone from the twenty-fifth weight percentile to the third in one month.  Now, I’m not a baby expert but I’m pretty sure they’re not supposed to shrink.
Raw food.  If only her ancestors had mastered the secret of fire.  Babies need fat, proteins, calories.  Less important: sprouts and hemp.  Starving babies is bad, and illegal in many cultures.  I’m having her admitted.
Antibiotics for the pneumonia, IV feeding to get the weight up.  Don’t worry, it’s a vegan IV.
Whoa!  [Vogler is standing right in front of him, and he doesn’t look happy.]  There you are, I’ve been looking everywhere for you.  Uh, listen, you said I had to cut one of my people if I didn’t give that speech about your drug, and in fairness to your point of view, my speech really wasn’t the one you had in mind, so I’ve cut Cameron.  Now we’re all squared away, right?
So that’s a ‘no’ on us being squared away.
Yeah, we had a nice little chat.  I really should have kept Cameron.  She knew where to find the sugar.
Ah ha!  [He shakes a packet of sugar triumphantly.]
What did she choke on?
What kind of food?
She choked on soft, wet pear.  Did she forget to take the bones out?  That’s way past muscle weakness.  Did you do an upper endoscopy?
 Oooh.  We’ve gotta talk.  [as he leaves]  And check her eyelids.
Well, enjoy the bagels.  I’m untouchable.
Any vote to revoke my tenure has to be unanimous. I’ve got you and maybe even Cuddy.
What can he do?  I’ve got a contract.
Does it involve candy?  Because I’m a sucker for chocolates.  [Wilson gives him a look and walks away, House takes a Vicodin or two.]
She’s doing better.
Technically, Alexander Fleming.  He developed antibiotics.  Pneumonia’s under control, and from now on, what say you stick with human food.
This time, that’s your guy. [House stars to leave, but is blocked by a bunch of people entering the room, including police officers.]
This is how Vogler’s gonna destroy me?
He had my patients arrested.
Those parents were not abusive, they’re idiots.
It was my call.
You know, there’s a new biography of Quisling, I think you might like it.
Uh, Norwegian guy, World War II, traitor.  The fact that I have to explain this kind of takes the edge off my flow.
From what?  Cops aren’t gonna bust me.  Disiplinary committee maybe gives me a slap on the wrist.
If I don’t give him one, he makes one up.
No.  There’s no calcification.
They do suck.  Where’s Wilson?
Cameron isn’t here.
You think this woman is making a rational decision?
Pretty damn rarely.  And not this time, this is purely biological.  In evolutionary terms, the needs of the next generation are more important.
Darwin is, I’m not.  The next generation is not my patient.  We have to raise the odds for Mommy.  And where the hell is Wilson?  He’s the oncologist.  [He leaves.]
You guys bust out?
Weird.  You’d think they’d let you take her home while they figured out if you tried to kill her.
The kid who stacks the free-range grapefruit in your health food store is not a nutritionist.
Foreman, I need a CT scan on…
Seriously?  [Joel nods proudly.]  Olive Kaplan.  Check for abscesses or occult infections. [He hangs up; to the Kaplans] Bu-bye.
Listen, Vogler’s all about clinical trials, the hospital’s chock full of them.  There’s got to be something for small-cell lung cancer.  [House notices that Wilson is packing his stuff in boxes.]  What are you doing?
Did you make a pass at Cuddy?  Told you, she only has thighs for me.
So he’s getting rid of every board member who votes to keep me around?
Just you?
But you’re only off the board, right?  They couldn’t have got unanimous approval for you.
Eh, so you’re off the board, big deal.  Frees up Wednesday nights for bowling.  You’re still a doctor –
Big of him.
[quietly] They mattered.  If I could do it all again –
Those clinical trials?
Thanks.
Nice job of protecting me.
His ass can wait.  You saved my job by sacking Wilson?
So it’s about the money.
We’ve sequenced the DNA of the tumor cells.  P53 gene mutation at codon 55.  She’s perfect for your trial.
Well, you want easy cases, you picked the wrong speciality.
Excellent.
Middle of next week.
She can start in two days.
She won’t be in two days.  I’ve scheduled a C-section.
Well, it’s definitely surgery, but major?
Again, a question of interpretation.
Oh, I think he’s got a big bag of those already.
Well, I’ll be sure to let her know that.  Care to join me?
Angiogenesis inhibitors prevent the tumors from creating blood vessels.  Without blood, the tumor starves.
The treatment would be fatal to the baby.  I’ve scheduled a C-section for later this afternoon.  It’s in the trial phase right now, but so far complete remission in more than thirty percent of subjects.
When your chances of living were less than a third of what they are now.
Our pediatrics department has the best neonatal ICU in the state.
Okay.  Leave the room.  [Sean does so.]  How long have you been taking oxybutynin?
Incontinence is pretty uncommon in a woman of your age.  It’s even more bizarre in a woman in her twenties.
Seems that way.  You said to your husband, “You don’t know what it’s like, raising a sick child.”  You didn’t say, “You don’t know what it would be like.”  This is not your first child, is it?  And he doesn’t know.
I’m sorry.
Very moving story.  Explains why you’re being so selfish.
Because it’s what you want.  Your husband wants you to live.
Oh, who the hell does?  Tragedies happen.  You think that turning yourself into a disposable incubator for a few weeks is going to protect your baby from all the crap in this world, go ahead, die happy.  I got no problems with people killing themselves, but don’t think it makes you a hero.
You’re scheduled for 4 P.M.
HEY!  You’re killing her!
She knows the risks, she was fully informed –
Not his life, not his call!
Right, so she kicks off, his number look bad.
Which would cost you money!
One person, one blip in the data!
Well, thank God you were here to save all those lives! [Vogler pauses, breathes, laughs, and shakes a finger at House.]
Did you get the clot?
How long was her oxygen at that level?
Brain function compromised? [The monitors go off again.]
She’s bleeding into her abdomen.
No, you stay here. [leaving] Keep her as stable as you can for as long as you can.  [He leaves the OR to find Sean pacing outside of it.]  She had trauma during the procedure.  She’s bleeding into her abdomen.  There’s nothing we can do; I’m sorry.
I need you to okay the C-section.
It probably will.
She’s dying either way. [Sean drops his coffee cup.]
Stay with me, Sean.  I need your okay on this.
Right, and that’s gonna be tough from now on, but this decision is easy.  You know what she’d want.
You make this call, only two things change.  One: yeah, you feel guilty for killing your wife.  Two: your baby lives.  Naomi’s baby lives.
We need to talk.
It’s about a patient.
I’m not talking about her.  At this point I think it’s best that I concentrate on patients who are still alive.  [Cuddy looks surprised.]  Pulmonary embolism.  She bled out.  Saved her son.  [He hands Cuddy some films.]  This is Olive Kaplan’s CT scan, the incredible shrinking baby.  [Cuddy looks at it.]
DiGeorge Syndrome.  It’s genetic, can cause the gland to wither to nothing.
Yeah.
I’ve sent a test down to confirm; when it comes back you should start Olive on immunoglobulin replacement.
I assume I won’t be here.
Cuddy is a genius, [Ball to Foreman] convincing four people to give up a fortune to save our sorry asses.  [Cuddy walks in.]  Dr. Cuddy! [He raises his glass.] The man of the hour.  [Foreman throws the ball to her, which she catches.  There are shouts of “Hey, hey!” and the like.]
We’re drinking.  I would have thought that was pretty obvious.  [Ball is  thrown to Chase, Cuddy picks up a glass.]
Well, thank you, Miss Buzzkill.
You voted to get rid of him.
I saw the light on.
Yeah, it’s a figure of speech.  Always so literal. [pause]
Yeah.  Guy in the store said it was slimming.  Vertical stripe…
Vogler is dead.
Again with the literal translation.  Vogler the idea, Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags, bow down before me; he is gone from the hospital, so things can go back to the way they were.
Weird works for me.
I want you to come back.
Please unclench.  You’re not on the clock, and when you do that, I clench, and then it’s the whole thing…
It’s no big deal, some sort of epidemic.  Not my area.
What I’m doing now is important.
Because you’re a good doctor.
That’s not enough?
Sorry, lot of sick people.  I might catch something.
Great, got it diagnosed, you don’t need me.
That’s a problem of resources, not diagnostics.  No, I’d be completely lost, get in everyone’s way.
[reading a thermometer] 102.  You win a trip to the second floor.  Next!
Take these, go home, talk to your daughter.
Your pants, your blouse, your scarf are all freshly dry cleaned.  Everything except your jacket, it’s got a smudge on it.  Probably two days old.  Which means you didn’t know the jacket had been worn.  So either your husband is a crossdresser or your daughter has been borrowing your clothes without telling you.  Probably wants to look older to get into bars.
Next!
Yow.
You have a rash?  Come on.  [Mary lifts her jacket to reveal a red rash on her hip.]
Yeah.  Does your neck hurt?  If it does, you get the trifecta.
Where are your parents?
[turns his neck] Go like this.  [Mary turns her head to the left and to the right, which hurts her.]  Now like this. [She then nods it to her chest and up, which doesn’t hurt at all.]
You’re coming with me.  [After looking at his pile of blue slips, Foreman follows.]
She’s had the rash a week.  If it was this meningitis, she’d be dead by now.  [Cuddy walks up.]
12-year-old female.  Fever, rash, neck pains.  Not meningitis.
Sure, pus in the spinal canal makes it hurt to move your head up and down, but her head only hurts moving side to side.
Doesn’t fit.
Those little pills you’re passing out so efficiently aren’t going to do Miss Louganis squat.
That’s right.  I’m subjecting a 12-year-old to a battery of dangerous and evasive tests to avoid being bored.  [Everyone stares at him.]  Okay, maybe I would do that, but I’m not.  If it turns out she does have meningitis, you’re right, you win, but if we go back downstairs and she dies… your face will be so red.
Get a lumbar puncture.  Some brain infections can be pretty clever at hide-and-seek.
No you won’t.  You, sir, will research all the causes in the universe of neck pain.
Start with the letter A.  And put her on rifampin.
In case I’m wrong.  It has happened.
What letter are you up to?
Torture combing through all that stuff, ain’t it?  Real dull.  Awful.
Well, thank goodness.  A lot of people would resent having to do this.
Think I’ve seen this movie.  The ending’s kind of dark.  [He offers some candy to Foreman.]  Want one?  [He pretends to offer one to Chase, but takes it away when he starts to take one.]  How come you did the endoscopy?
Foreman is not your boss.  When I tell you to do something – whoa.  Hold it there.  Back it up a couple of frames.  [He looks intently at the image on the screen.]  Oh, yeah!  That’s your money shot.
Really?  Ginormous thing on the right side of her intestine doesn’t even intrigue you?
No, but it does tell us something.  Though I have no idea what.
Precursor isn’t causing all of her other symptoms.  What else?  [Cuddy enters.]
I hurt my leg.  I have a note.
Dr. Chase, I told you to tell us when our time was up.  She has intestinal bleeding.
No, you need more nurses.  But you cut back on the nursing staff so you have doctors doing what the nurses should be doing.
[to patient, handing her a blue slip] Go, be free.  [A bouncy teen walks up.]
No fever, no neck pain.  Take the elevator to the third floor.
Smell her hair, no chlorine.  Which means she wasn’t at the pool.  Which means she’s come to a quarantined area because she’s a idiot or she’s insane.  No one is that stupid.  East wing, psych ward, bye-bye.  [She wanders off.]
You up to Bs?  Well done!
[to Foreman] Get a sample of her bone marrow.
Break time.
Use Chase’s break, too.  Go.
What, and miss out on all this fun?
You don’t think he has it coming?
That’s cold.  All he did was save his job.
Right rudder.  [She follows.]  Bank, bank, bank!
Trying to think of anything except the produce department at Whole Foods.  [Wilson tries not to smile/laugh.]
Sorry, you just don’t usually see breasts like that on Deans of Medicine.
No, they can be babes.  You just don’t usually see their funbags.
Ah, not interviewing today.  I don’t know if you’ve heard, but there’s this big time epidemic.  Many sick people puking in the hallways, it’s crazy.
He’s in a band.
Totally.  What kind of music do you play?
[pops a Vicodin] Oh, dude.  You are so hired.
Not a chance.
Tattoo. [Dr. Spain turns his right arm to reveal an Asian symbol on his forearm.]
Nonconformity, right.  I can’t remember the last time I saw a 20-something kid with a tattoo of an Asian letter on his wrist.  You are one wicked free thinker.  You want to be a rebel?  Stop being cool.  Wear a pocket protector like he does and get a haircut.  Like the Asian kids who don’t leave the library for 20 hours stretches, they’re the ones who don’t care what you think.  Sayonara.  [Dr. Spain leaves.]
Actually, the Asian kids are probably just responding to parental pressure, but my point is still valid.
Are you sure it was an absence seizure?
Do you mind?  We’re trying to work.
Looking, but not finding.  You do an EEG?
Which tells us…
And?  [More groaning.]  Good lord, are you having a bowel movement or a baby?
A bleed in the brain can cause seizures.
Doesn’t have to be.
Well, let’s see now, there’s the 18-year-old has-been that she beat out to make Nationals, the has-been’s parents, jealous siblings, sociopathic swim fan, and then there’s just your plain old garden variety whack job. [The toilet flushes, and some kid patient walks out of the stall.]  Hey!  You know what a hemorrhoid is?
Well, google it.  And try some Raisin Bran instead of the donuts.  [He turns on the faucet with his cane.]  Okay, do a CT scan, check for intercranial bleeding.
If our patient’s bleeding into her brain, she’s gonna be dead in 8 hours.
-- who touched you in the naughty place?
Hmm.  Ancient, but if there’s enough bleeding it might work.  Okay, do what the guy who didn’t specialize in neurology said.  [Foreman leaves.]
[mimics him, then] You’ve still got to cover Q-Z.
Sorry I’m late, I was taking a dump.
You actually speak four languages, or you just banking on never being interviewed by anyone who does?  [He takes some Vicodin.]
Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel?  Did you fall for him and can’t handle it, or is it the other way around?  [Wilson is a little shocked by the way this conversation is going.]
You Jewish?  [Wilson gives him a “hey, now!” kind of look.]
Is it true what they say about Jewish foreplay?
I heard four.
No way.
Did you see her shoes?
The eyes can mislead, the smile can lie, but the shoes always tell the truth.
They were not Prada.  You wouldn’t know Prada if one stepped on your scrotum.
Exactly, they were stylish, and very painful to wear.  Only an incredibly shallow and insecure woman would rather be in pain all day then wear a decent looking, comfortable shoe, and that’s exactly the type I don’t need around here.
Blue form to the security guard.
So what, your advice is... hire someone I’m not happy with and be happy?
Now it’s people.  I thought we were talking about fellowship applicants.
Well, when I do decide to push you away, I hope there’s a small person kneeling behind you so you fall down and hurt your head.
You saw the shoes!
You’re talking about Cameron.
Cameron is so not perfect.
Mother Teresa?
Angelina Jolie?
Now who’s being picky?
I need an operating room and a surgeon.
Our little mermaid is bleeding into her temporal lobe.
20 minutes.
Stop it.  Stop looking for things we don’t know and focus on what we do know.  What do we actually know besides what’s up there? Come on, how hard can it be to tell me what you already know?
What else?  Come on!  [He leaves the room.]
[to Chase and Foreman, who just walked up] We’re missing something.
Well, if I knew that it wouldn’t be missing.
No, she’s got her mom’s eyes and a red patch of hair just like dad.
That’s a lot of balloons.
Not unless she’s been competing in the nude all these years.
What if the rash isn’t a rash?
Who gave her the balloons?
What about the guys?
Which guys visited her?
She’s cute, she’s nice, she’s a kick-ass diver.  You’d think the guys would be falling over themselves to get close to her.
Okay, so maybe they’re just not interested.  Or…
There any cell fragments in her blood smears?
Check ‘em again.
You done yet?
Starts with T.  You were so close.
There is one other possible cause.
Pregnancy cause all kinds of chemical and biological changes in a woman’s body.  Or a girl’s body, as the case may be.  [He moves the screen so she can see the fetus.]  In extremely rare cases, everything goes haywire.  It’s called TTP.  Blood starts clotting like crazy, clogs the vessels in your brain and kidneys.  Red blood cells end up getting shredded as they squeeze past the clot like a fat guy in a crowed bar. I’m sure you know what that’s like.  You’re only 12, but you’re all grown up, right?  [He offers her tissues.]  Travel on your own, hang out in hotel rooms getting room service with your teammates, maybe someone sneaks in a couple of beers, you start playing spin the bottle… next thing you know you’re waking up in nothing but your socks.
Of course not.  You wanted it.
Actually, under New Jersey law the term is ‘felon.’
We’re going to have to do something called plasmapheresis.  It cleans the antibodies from your blood.  We’re also going to have to terminate the pregnancy.
Someone should.  Rock paper scissors?
Of course you will.  If you’re old enough to bleed out of your vagina, obviously you’re old enough to handle a simple thing like an abortion without Mommy and Daddy’s help.
Under New Jersey law, you’re the boss.
Your daughter has TTP.  Don’t worry, it’s curable, she’ll be fine.
Some really big words that you’ve never heard before and when we’re done we’ll never hear again.  Have a nice day.
Uh, in a few days.  She needs some minor surgery to remove the underlying cause before we can do the… another really big word.
She has an abnormal growth in her abdomen.
It’s very simple.  We do it here all the time.
Actually, no.  I’m sorry.
I know.
There is no opening.
I know.  The position’s been filled.
Exactly.  [He gets up to leave.]
You figure if you keep arguing I’m going to cave, admit it’s all a lie, and hire you?  [He leaves.]
I don’t want to interview anyone else.
Hah.  That’s good.  And why I need you around.  To keep me in my place.  [He keeps trying to look into Cameron’s apartment.  Heh.]
Wasn’t listening.
You want me to listen to you more?  I can do that.
With who?
Unaccept it.
Because Yule is boring.  He’s pedantic and preachy.  Because he’s short.  Because I want you to come back.
Want more money?  A car allowance, better parking space?
You’ll come back to work if I go out on a date with you?
Okay, it’s a deal.  [They shake on it.]
Don’t be late.
You don’t know her.
Don’t have TiVo on this thing, can’t rewind.  Shut up.
You don’t even know her.
He’s a patient.
He’s got to go back to work as soon as I’m done with the examination.  Guess I do, too.
Keep talking.  I’ll finish your exam with a prostate check.  [to Wilson] I’ve agreed to take her on one date.
No!  She’s not giving me any choice. [Wilson now looks a bit puzzled.]
Date her.
For God’s sake. [He grabs his TV and leaves.  As he’s walking out the door --]
[over them] Grow up.  And learn to harmonize.  [He shuts the door and runs into Harvey, who spills an open cup of liquid on him.]  Damn it!
Who the hell walks around with an open urine sample?
Well, he peed on me.  I’m not into that. [Wilson sniffs House’s jacket.]
I forgive you for ruining my jacket.  [Harvey doesn’t move.]  Look, you seem like a regular kind of guy, not the type to get another regular guy into trouble, am I right? [It sounds like Harvey is sobbing, House rolls his eyes.]  Twenty bucks cash if you’ll stop crying.  [Nothing doing.]  Forgive me, yell at me, just give me something I can work with, okay?  [He grabs Harvey’s shoulder, and turns him around to reveal a Harvey that’s not doing well at all.  He quickly checks his pulse and flashes a light in his pupils, which are blown.  Wilson shows up.]
Get a wheelchair, and get this guy into the ER.
Right pupil’s blown.
[entering with Wilson] Cause this is the happiest place on Earth.  21-year-old male, comes in with grinding of the teeth.
Sure, but since he’s not dead or in a coma, I’m going with stroke to the optic nerve.  [He puts up scans on the light board.]  CT scan shows two things.
And?
You’re looking at the wrong part of the scan.
Metal plate.  He’s had major reconstruction and there’s no way we’re removing it, so we’re forced to be clever.  Angiogram to rule out vascultis, EMG for peripheral neuropathy, tox screen to eliminate drugs, an echo to rule out cardiac emboli.  [As they all leave] Dr. Cameron.  I’d appreciate you keeping the terms of your new contract to yourself.  Don’t want everyone clamoring for the same perks.
Pleasure to meet you. [Vicodin goes “pop”!]
[sitting and putting on rubber gloves] Not anymore.  So, does it hurt when you tinkle?
You have some vaginal tearing.  No sign of brusing, no indication of trauma, forced entry… Ramona.  You naughty girl.  You’ve either got yourself an 18-year-old boyfriend or an 80-year-old with some little blue pills.
Lucky you.
Prefer it if Myron was a little droopier?
[going for the big question] Have you talked to him about this?
Here’s a prescription for vaginal estrogen suppositories.  It’ll help with the lubrication.
You can’t tell him the truth, so you want me to lie to him?
Close your legs.  [He leaves.]
Well, based on this history it’s either toxic herbs from the homeopath, spinal damage from the chiropractor, infection from the needle that the acupuncturist accidentally let sit in eye of newt, or the Shen balancer.  What the hell is a “shen” and how come it’s lopsided?
Hang up a shingle and condemn the narrowness and greed of Western medicine, you’d make a damn fine living.
Of course, no harm, no foul.  It’s just taking a few bucks from superstitious idiots, right?
Except the six months that he had with these charlatans might have been spent going to someone who looks at things that exist in the real world.  But that’s just me being all narrow again.
Hmm.  Quite a dilemma.  [House picks up a magic 8-ball.]  Oh, great pool hall oracle, grant me guidance. [He shakes it.]  Do we go with Foreman’s theory, which is at least marginally supported by medical test results, or Chase’s theory, which is completely unsupported by medical evidence.  What to do…
And all signs point to… [He looks at the 8-ball.]  Sorry, Chase.  The gods have spoken.  Start Harvey on blood thinners and antibiotics.
Well, that’s an intriguing legal opinion. Geez, what kind of a lawyer is he?
Then what was the point?
Call the cops, bar her from the hospital, force her to pierce your nipples… not really medical decisions.
Chase.  Did you know about this woman?  What she does?
I wouldn’t have tortured you if I knew you liked it. [Chase kind of laughs at that.]  Well, here’s a phrase to remember: “Hey, this guy might have been pounded on the head one too many times!”
Yeah, could have carried a tad more weight if you’d mentioned the “liking pain” thing.  You’re on my naughty list.  Sorry, no leather stethoscope this Christmas.
I assume you never started him on antibiotics or blood thinners before Mistress Ilsa’s rude interruption.
Start him on antibiotics and blood thinners. [House watches as an older gentleman walks into his office.  He watches the man throughout the rest of this scene.]
No, he’s probably right.
But if Foreman’s right about it being bacterial endocarditis, and we – [Foreman raises his hand.]
Okay, if Foreman used to be right about it being blood clots, and we take the surgery route, then we’ll probably kill the guy.  So, start him on blood thinners, and if he has another stroke, then we’ll schedule the surgery.  [He opens the door to his office.]  Yeah?
I have a feeling I’m going to regret this, but yes.
She lied.  [He hands Myron a script.]  Here you go.
Always happy to make people happy.  Goodbye.
How much more of what?
You don’t want more sex?
Hey, here’s a radical thought.  Talk to her.
Sounds crazy when you put it like that.
In the hospital?  Could be.  Let’s see if we can find it.
Got any blue pills?
Well, that’s one example of a blue pill.  Name six others.
Perfect.  Fill her up.  [House nods to Myron.  Cuddy walks up.]
Little busy here.
It’s purely business.  I’ll make sure you get the recipt.
Wow.  Well, you’ve certainly given me a lot to think about.  If only I was as open as you.
Actually, it was your blouse I was talking about. [Cuddy smiles.]
Stop the treatment. [to Foreman] Sorry, we tried your way, you could not have been wronger.
Oh yeah, we’ve all got perfect 20-20 hindsight.  Get a hold of Main in vascular, see if his surgical dance card is free for tomorrow. [Chase and Foreman leave.  Cameron clears her throat.]
You couldn’t keep your mouth shut.
That would be army boots and t-shirt.  It’s the county paintball tourney.  First prize is fifty bucks; I’ll split it with you if you hold your end up.
Relax.  I made a reservation at Café Spiletto.  Regarding wardrobe: are you too young to remember spandex?
Someone should just tell him to do it.  Way faster.
Not you.  Where’s a good dominatrix when you need one?
If you get caught, Cuddy’s got a hairbrush.  And believe me, she knows how to use it.
Yeah.  It’s making me question my view of myself as a people person.
Emergent situation, invoke heroic measures.
Great, where do I get me one of them?  Do I need to lawyer up?
Well, they might have a problem signing anything seeing as how they’re dead.
Like what, dad’s hand?  I don’t even know where they’re buried.
Great, and when your searches turn up nothing you should try to find out where they live.
Accountants, they’re usually pretty good with money, so how come he lives in a slum like Market Town?
Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim?  The odds are astronomical.
That’d be my bet.  Go to his apartments.  See if you can find his folks.  Address, number, something. [House walks into his office.  Foreman follows him.]
Sure.
[turns on the TV] Time’s up.  Thanks for playing.
Way ahead of you.  I’ve got a case of malt liquor stashed in the trunk, Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD, we are gonna get all the way down.  Now move. [Foreman sits on the TV, which was not what House had in mind.]
Oh, you know me too well.
I’m missing my soap for this?
And fall for me even more.  The Love Doctor has made an art of breaking up with women.  ‘Cause you’re convinced that the loss of you would be too devastating for any woman to handle.
I’ll do it.  [He flicks a yo-yo in Chase’s face.]  Let the master show you how it’s done. [Chase takes a few tic-tacs as House dials.]  Mr. Park?  This is Dr. House calling from Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.  Your son Harvey is dead.  We need you to identify the body.  Yes, I’m sorry, it’s the law. [Cameron is shocked, Chase rolls his eyes, and Foreman is grinning.  House hangs up and takes the mint box from Chase.]  There’s a real art to delivering bad news.
Be sure to let me know when Cuddy starts screaming. [Chase takes the second mint box from his pocket and eats a few more.]
It’s only a white lie.  Technically, all I did was call them a little early.  Trust me, he’ll be dead real soon.  Actually, I saved you some rush hour traffic.
Fine.  Just as soon as you sign this surgery consent.  I have a pen.  [Mrs. Park takes out her cell phone and dials.]
But you don’t get off on embarrassment the way your son does.  I guess it skips a generation.
Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute.  But here’s the thing.  Humiliation comes in all kinds of packages.  People finding out that your son’s a perv, that’s pretty high up there.  People finding out that you’d rather let your son die than sign a piece of paper, where’s that rank?  And trust me, if I have to paste up a sign in every nail salon and dumpling shop in Pennsylvania, I’ll make sure they know.  [He offers them a pen.  Mrs. Park turns off her phone and signs the paper.]  Your son will be in surgery first thing in the morning.  Dumplings, that was a cheap shot.  [He leaves.]
This is a mistake.  I don’t know how to have casual conversation.  You think you’re talking about one thing, and either you are and it’s incredibly boring, or you’re not because it’s subtext and you need a decoder ring.
I have been on a date.
Did your wife give them to you?
I should cancel.  I’ve got a patient in surgery tomorrow. [House moves to the kitchen.]
[looking in the fridge] No beer.
This is pretty lame, right?  [Wilson smiles.]
Thank you.
Yeah.  It’s changed a lot since the last time I was here.  It used to be a strip joint.  [Cameron laughs.] Nice earrings.
Nice shoes.  Comfortable?
We’re in a restaurant, we’re dressed up, we’re eating.  If not small talk, what is there? [Awkward pause of doom.]
I treat you like garbage, so I must really like you.  Given your Freudian theory, what does it mean if I start being nice to you?
Hmm.  So there’s absolutely nothing I can do to make you think that I don’t like you.
You live under the delusion that you can fix everything that isn’t perfect.  That’s why you married a man who was dying of cancer.  You don’t love, you need.  And now that your husband is dead, you’re looking for your new charity case.  That’s why you’re going out with me.  I’m twice your age, I’m not great looking, I’m not charming, I’m not even nice.  What I am is what you need.  I’m damaged.  [He picks up his menu, leaving Cameron to think.]
She had the ravioli, I had the puttanesca.
Well, I did have a little indigestion afterwards.  Maybe it was the garlic bread.
Nothing deep, mostly small talk.
Took your advice, complimented her shoes, that’s fifteen minutes of chat right there.
I don’t think so.
If it’s not clots, a loading dose of blood thinners is gonna make him bleed out of his ears.  Then he won’t be able to hear.  [Myron and Ramona tap on the glass of Diagnostics.] Oy ve.  [yelling] Nobody home, leave a message!
Chase, Cameron, get another angiogram and echo.  Better get a full-body scan.  If it is clots, it’d be good to know where they are. [They all file out of the office; House goes to talk to Myron and Ramona.]  Sorry about that.  Guy dying.
Well, glad to see you’ve got the correct perspective on the thing.
Nice visual.
Candy wouldn’t take away your headaches.
You came to me and told me that you were having too much sex.
You too, Sequoia.
I know that everybody lies, but you’d think that after a certain amount of time together you wouldn’t be trying so hard.  [Myron fidgets with his wedding ring.]  Your rings don’t match.
Well, style is one thing, but one silver, one gold?  How long have you guys been married?
Damn it, you’re having an affair.
You guys aren’t the victim of the little blue pill, you’re the problem!
Aw.  [Myron takes out a breath spray and sprays his mouth.]  Oh, welcome to hell.  [House closes his eyes as Myron and Ramona kiss in front of him.  And it hits him.  He takes the tic-tacs he took from Chase out of his pocket and starts to walk off.]
Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.
Dr. Chase, these breath mints you’ve been popping since yesterday.  Are they a new fetish?
And you didn’t find that interesting.
Wrong.
Chase, get your nose in here.
Come on, just put your face in his mouth.  [Chase does so, and then recoils.]
Rich, wouldn’t you say?
Number one sign of fulminating osteomylitis.
Probably from the original break.  Never healed properly.  [CGI demonstrates.]  Infected tissue from the jaw breaks off, blocks blood flow to the brain, and life just isn’t worth living without blood.
Like this.  [He sticks a syringe in Harvey’s jaw, pulling out pus from the infection.]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus.  [He hands the syringe to Chase, and takes the tic-tacs from him, eating a few.]  We’re gonna remove the jaw. Anybody got a buzzsaw?  Okay, call a surgeon.
Hi, I’m Dr. House.  [to the nurse] How’s tricks, Annette?  [The nurse turns, and it is indeed Annette in nurse’s scrubs.]
No, it’s okay. I came to talk to you both.  Like I tell all my patients, you’ve simply got to say “no” to strangulation.  Me, I’m a freak, I get off on not being in pain.  That, and chocolate-covered marshmallow bunnies.
Yeah, he is.  A little.  But it’s got to stop.  Or he’ll die.
Well, lock him in a cage.  That should be fine, medically.
 You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it?  I think I’m coming down with a little bit of the clap.  I may have to go home for a few days.
You said this is the fifth time he’s missed a class this year!  Either he’s dying or he’s lying.
Fine, I’ll have Cameron do it.  She loves inspiring the inspired. [He starts to walk off.
[turning back] Why is it always me?
I’m not doing it.  [He leaves, stops at the door, and walks back in.]  You’re supposed to stop me.  Renegotiate.
I’ll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.
I’m outta here, take it up with Cuddy.
Hi, Stacy.
How am I doing?  Well, the last five years have been like… you ever see those “Girls Gone Wild” videos?
Is that why you’re here?  [Stacy shakes her head.]
Who am I looking at?
Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells.  No sign of tumors, no vasculitis.  Could be indigestion, or maybe a kidney stone.  A little one, can pack a lot of wallop.
Not to someone so poorly endowed.  This guy’s pancreas is pathetic.  [He walks off, Stacy follows.]
Well, maybe there’s nothing to be found.
The walks are out.  [Stacy grabs his arm.]
Interesting.  It means there’s either a neurological component or he’s having an affair.
I’m not too busy, but I’m not sure I want him to live.  It’s good seeing you again.  [He leaves, and Stacy is holding back tears.]
Three guys walk into a clinic.  Their legs hurt.  What’s wrong with them?  [A student – let’s call him Keen Student – raises his hand.]  I’m not going to like you, am I?
Statistically, you’re right.  Very good.  My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise.  Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents.  I said three people.  That’s six legs.  So, you’ve got three hurt jogging, two in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant. [Some chuckles.  Another student – let’s call her the Caring one – pipes up.]
I have no idea. [Enter the third student: the Rebellious one.]
Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened.  Person A, farmer, says he was fixing a fence. [Cut to a visual of the farmer.]  Tightness of the ankle, loss of muscle control. [The farmer groans and collapses.]  Person B, volleyball practice.  [Cut to a girls’ volleyball team, where there is one middle-aged man playing with them.  He dives for the ball and falls on the ground, clutching his leg.]  Coach figured it was a pulled muscle.  And C, [cut to a mini-golf course] we’ve got Carmen Electra.  Golfing.  [Her ball makes it into the golden Buddha, and she goes, “Yes!”]
The Baywatch thespian.  And no, I’ve gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged man.  Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative.  Also, she’s apparently quite the golfer.  [He stands.]  Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death.  Any guesses on which is which? [Silence.]  Okay, I say we start with the farmer.
Did you hike to the fence, and how far?
And where’s the pain localized?
So, what should we do first?  [He turns, and Keen Student is standing right next to him.]
Indicative of leg pain?  That’s a very short list.  Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma?  [The farmer shakes his head.  Caring Student pops up.]
Bzzt!  Sorry, thanks for playing.  Patient’s dead.  You killed him.  [The students look and sure enough, the farmer’s dead on the table.]
You had time to look at the leg.  [They look down, and the leg (and the overalls, and the whole farmer garb) is now the property of one Carmen Electra.  She takes the straw out of her mouth and smiles.]
We are.  But if we’re going to look at a leg…
I need you to take off your pants.  [House stands in the corner with a smug look on his face as Carmen takes off the overalls.  She gets back on the table, playing with her hair as she does so.  House looks at the wound, and then looks out as he proclaims --] Puncture.
That would be my guess.
That’s what he said.  Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, never saw a thing.
You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?
Oh, there are people to find those things out.
And while we wait for the Humane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?
It’s a leg.  A leg is a leg is a leg.
Would you worry about her more if she was younger?
Yeah, right.  I saw the way you were looking at Carmen.  She’s mine, stay away.  [Chuckles from the class.]  Would you operate on your mother?
Then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like they’re family?  The actual patient is 16.  Here’s what happens when doctors care to much.
You got all this from an examination of the knee?
She doesn’t have tendoni—
She’s depressed about having tendonitis.
Not the boy.
Ah.  Problems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.
No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule.  Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.
Here’s how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.
I’d rather you didn’t. [Caring Student shows up.]
First one.  The golfer.  [Enter Keen Student.]
[to Carmen]  You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon.  Anyone?  [Rebellious Student has shown up.]
Could be.  How bad does it hurt?
Yeah?
Oh, for God’s sake.  She’s here to play out my fantasy, not because she’s Meryl Streep. [Caring Student and Carmen both give him a look.]  Fine.  [Carmen disappears, and we see a man in his late 30s, now known as Late 30s Man.]
Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? [The last part is almost drowned out.]
 Sir, where are you getting pain?
Oooh.
[holding up the syringe] What do I do?
Apparently, he’s not allergic.
No, you did exactly what his attending did.
Yeah.
You’re going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there’s a reason: it works.  Meanwhile, back on the farm…
What say we take five?  Get some coffee, go pee.  [He leaves.]
She asked me the same question.
There’s probably nothing wrong with him.
So I should help her because she hates me.
The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you’d expect in a case of tendonitis.
What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?
No.  But that would make you interested, right?  What if her T4 came back low?  It’s not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.
No, I didn’t.  I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.  Apparently the patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.
You were right the first time.  Snakebite guy’s way more interesting.  Gross, actually.
[looking at the tests]  No, it’s not.  Notice the volume?
200mg.  Our guy got bit less than four hours ago.  There’s no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.
Nope.  Unless you’ve got a patient bit by one.  Then it might be helpful.  So what do we do now?
Or you go online and find there’s only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral.  The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.
Is that a question?
Very good.
No need.  Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.
Again, was that a question?  I asked what you would do.  It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do.  Who gives the guy the other antivenin? [Half of the class raises their hands.]  And who goes looking for the snake?
That’s usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.
Yeah.
I’m sure this goes against everything you’ve been taught, but right and wrong do exist.  Just because you don’t know what the right answer is – maybe there’s even no way you could know what the right answer is – doesn’t make your answer right or even okay.  It’s much simpler than that.  It’s just plain wrong.
[voiceovers] We gave the guy the antivenin.
[taking some Vicodin]  On average, drug addicts are stupid.
Good for you.  A lot of doctors wouldn’t risk their careers on a hunch.
I believe drug addicts get sick.  Actually, for some reason they tend to get sick more often than non-drug addicts.  Luckily, you don’t have to play your hunch, there’s a faster way.  Actually, there are several.  My preference is urine testing.
That’s not what I’m testing for.
We’re going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder.  It might be a little uncomfortable.
We’re concerned about allergic reactions today.
If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he’s really sick.
There’s easier ways to get a hold of drugs.  Other hospitals, for example.  [He takes a mug out of the desk and sniffs it.  He starts to walk off.]  The volleyball player is not responding to treatment.  [He leaves to go to the water fountain, and yells back -- ] At least we think it’s not working on account of the fact she’s getting worse.  Can you still hear me?
[filling the mug]  Well, if you can’t hear me, how do you know what I asked?
Not her real name!
The question is why.  Likely suspects?
[slowly] The adenoma is most likely.  Check her PTH –
-- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi.  Okay, that’s enough about the volleyball player.  What’s up with the farmer?  [They all look at him.]
Snakebite guy.  Oh, right, you guys don’t know about him.  He doesn’t get bitten until three months after we treat the volleyball player.  Luckily, it’s been well established that time is not a fixed construct.  [He walks over to the white board, which now has writing on it pertaining to the farmer.] His condition’s not improving; double the dosage.
There’s another antivenin, it’s not as effective, but –
The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to –
[to the camera] What does it all mean?
We tried every other antivenin we had.
Yep.  He’s dying.  His wife’s here, finally found a babysitter.  Who wants to let him know?  Actually, I’m kidding.
Oh, yeah, he’s dying, but there’s no wife and kid.  Which is great.  Makes the “breaking the news” thing way easier.  Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.
The drug addict is peeing blood.
How do they teach you how to tell someone that they’re dying?  It’s kind of like teaching architects how to explain why their building fell down.  Do you roleplay and stuff?
And what do you have to do to get an A in You’re Dying 101?  They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness?  Is there a scale for measuring compassion?  This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks every time somebody says “Thank you.”  Imagine that.  This guy’s so good, people thank him for telling them that they’re dying.  [He looks at his picture.]  Eh, needs brown.  I don’t get thanked that often.
You’re dying.  In a few hours.  There’s nothing we can do except deal with the pain.
You’re not going home.
Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions?  It’s a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies.  The only variable is about what.  The weird thing about telling someone they’re dying is it tends to focus their priorities.  You find out what matters to them.  What they’re willing to die for.  What they’re willing to lie for.
Well, you must have a neighbor who –
Then the Humane Society can take him in and –
It wasn’t a snakebite, was it?
Sure you do.  Just not by a snake.  I assume that Cujo bit one of your neighbors awhile back.  You tell me that he bit you, and I gotta report it.  Cujo’s got a record, he gets the chair.  The good news is, you might just live.  The bad news is, your dog’s gonna die.
What would you call that?  That’s tea-colored, right?  The guy who we thought was just after the drugs… what’s the differential diagnosis for urine that’s tea-colored?
Kidney stones would cause what?
What color is your pee?
What color is your blood?
What colors did I use?
And brown.  What causes brown?
Which means the kidneys are shutting down.  Why?
None that his history would indicate.
Treatment?
Other possible causes.
Start him on antibiotics.  What else?  [She pauses.]  Come on, come on!
You’re useless.  But at least you know it.  Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase, what does that tell you?
You sure?
You know what’s worse than useless?  Useless and oblivious.  [He goes to the Keen student.]  What are they missing?
Yeah?  You think it’s going to be easier when you’ve got a real patient really dying? [to everyone] What are you missing?]
Not your case.
Brilliant.  MRI his leg, see what’s killing it.
Because the neck scan revealed nothing and her doctor’s way more obsessive than she thinks she is.  [Cameron, sitting in the back, tries not to act like that was directed at her.]
Because Dr. Cameron back there said muscle death, not one of you said it!  Not one of this guy’s doctors said it.  They gave him bed rest and antibiotics, just like you guys would have.
No.
Three days.  It is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up.  You are gonna kill someone.  If you can’t handle that reality, pick another profession.  Or finish medical school and teach.
No, three days before the patient suggested it might have been muscle death.
His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn’t caused by the self-injection, wasn’t caused by an infection.  It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction.
I don’t care what you find.
I like my leg.  I’ve had it for as long as I can remember.
They’re not cutting it off.
Patient made the right choice.  Tell a surgeon it’s okay to cut a leg off and he’s going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.
Well, of course they care about their patients.  They just care about themselves more.  Which is not an unreasonable position.  Trying to maximize the tissue you save also maximizes the chances of something going wrong.  Which means you’ve gotta be extra careful.  Which is such a pain in the ass.
Yeah, they’re just not as pretty.  Do a bypass, restore the circulation.
For you, or me?
Four-day blockage.
If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system.  The cytokines could cause organ failure, the potassium could cause cardiac arrest.  On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back.
I’ll get through it.  I understand the risks, you’re in the clear.  Go schedule an OR.  [Cuddy leaves.]
I think I’m more of a jerk.
I’m not gonna die.
I think they gotta up that morphine.
The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.
Sure doesn’t mean they’re right.
I can handle it.
That’s why I need the damn morphine!
Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.
The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.
Well, you better make it fast, ‘cause I’m about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.
Listen, it’s not a narcotic!  I’m not looking for a buzz.  You’ve got about twenty seconds.  [His breathing quickens, and the monitors all go off.]  I was wrong.  [Nurses and doctors enter, including Cuddy.]
The patient was technically dead for over a minute.
Define real.  They were real experiences.  What they meant… Personally, I choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see visions, this patient saw.  They’re all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down.
There’s no conclusive science.  My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting.
I find it more comforting to believe that this isn’t simply a test.
It’s bad.
It’s just taking longer.
It’s my leg.  It’s my life.
Of course I would.
I would say it’s their choice.
I can’t, I can’t, I’m sorry.
I know, I know.  I need you to talk to the doctor.
Thank you.  [to Stacy] Hey.
I’ll see you when I wake up.  We’ll go golfing.  I love you.
[going under] You’ve got nothing to be sorry about.  [Stacy gets up and walks over to Cuddy.]
Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the patient’s leg was severely compromised.  Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, patient continues to experience chronic pain.
[half-laugh] They usually are.  Do you have a buzzer or something.  What time does this class end?
I’m not doing this again.  [picking up the “World’s greatest dad” mug and walking toward Cuddy] And this guy is not the world’s greatest dad.  Not even ranked.  Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint?  That’s why he’s always sick.  Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again.  [He leaves, leaving behind a full room of shellshocked students.]
Stacy, it’s Gregg.  I’ve got an opening for ten tomorrow morning.  Make sure your husband isn’t late.  [He hangs up, and enters his office.]
I gotta go.
He’s cancelled two exams, he’s not gonna –
Sure.  The ex-boy-toy.  Eh, that makes sense.
Right, you think being afraid of me is a symptom of a serious ailment.
He’s twenty minutes late.  I’m outta here.
Why?  Because he loves you and does everything he’s told?
He likes to see.
Hi.  I’m Gregg House.  You must be Matt.
Yeah.  Wow.
Makes sense to me.
What do you want me to do?
He says he’s healthy.  What’s to check out?
Oh, he’s good.  If you can fake sincerity, you can fake pretty much anything.  I can’t tell you how much I like your fella.
You know, we should do things together.  Maybe throw a ball around or something.  Guy stuff.
Hah!  He’s Oscar Wilde!
[raising his glass] Here’s to women.  You can’t live with ‘em, you can’t kill ‘em until the neighbors are stripping in Atlantic City.
I’m definitely taller.
Garçon! [Translation corner: Garçon means “boy” in French, and is a not-too-nice way to address a waiter.] [He snaps his fingers to get their attention.]  It’s okay, ladies and gentlemen, nothing to worry about.  Unless you had the veal.
I told you, I’d check him out.  I was a little worried they were gonna get here before he’d passed out.  Would have been tougher to get him to drink.  I’ll give you a ride.  We can talk.  [Stacy gives him a dirty look and walks out with the paramedics.]
Morning.  You guys got the file?  What’s wrong?
Then we’re done!  What do you think, ball game, zoo?  I don’t care, I just want to hang with you guys.
Yeah, sorry, that was me.  I had to dope him up to get him in here.  Guy doesn’t think he’s sick.
His wife.
That’s her Indian name.  On her driver’s license it’s Stacy.  I assume you have a point.
The truth, I hear voices.  All the time.  Telling me to do stuff, it’s crazy, huh?
I was lying.  Do the things, the, you know, blah blah blah blah blah, all that stuff the other docs did.  If that’s negative, ultrasound his belly.  If that’s negative, CT his abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast.  [heading to his office]  Did I miss anything?
Well, we could certainly give that a – oh, you minx.
She’s married.  Big clue I lost the game.
I thought she wanted me to treat him.
But what if they get close to each other?  What do I do then?
Please, don’t put me on a pedestal.
No, it means we have no idea what’s wrong with him. [Foreman walks up.]
No, today.  Call him.  Tell him I’ll make it work.
[to Foreman] Whoa, hold it!  There’s no need for exploratory surgery, Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.
No, it’s premature to put him on a list for hospice care.  [Chase and Foreman both roll their eyes.] And it’s maybe irresponsible to imply my actions are not rationally supported.
Who says that his stomach hurts.  Works for me.
His wife’s a lawyer.  She’s very convincing.  Call Goldstein, surgery’s on.  [House walks off, then Chase and Foreman, leaving Cameron standing in the hall with her mouth hanging open.]
Double milk, no sugar.
You know why people sit in waiting rooms?
People think the closer they’re sitting to the operating room, the more they care.
Are you doing anybody besides Mark?  [She looks at him.]  It’s a medical question.
Knew you’d understand.
Neurogenic bladder isn’t causing the pain.
Give me the video for the surgery.
Dr. Mandingo, you’re needed at the plantation house.
Well, don’t everybody talk at once. [He pops a couple of Vicodin.]
Stop looking at the suspiciously empty bottle and look at the screen.  Here’s why I get the big bucks.  This is nothing.  An enhanced version of nothing.  [He plays the tape a bit, then stops it.]  This is the problem.
A time bomb in his brain.  I forget, who said it was nothing?
Enough nerves die, he dies.
He won’t die right away.  He’ll just want to.
Last I heard Alzheimer’s had a genetic component.  Patient have parents?
Send CSF or CBC and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis, and get Tal proteins to check for Alzheimer’s.  And this [wielding the history] still feels a little light.
[to Foreman] Check out their house.  Take Sparky with you.
You can expense the tolls.
[to Foreman and Chase as they leave] Her secret diary: that’s the main thing.  But as long as you’re there, take a peek in the medicine cabinet.  Check for toxins, heavy metals… anything that would explain this other than encephalitis or Alzheimer’s.  [The men leave.]  And get receipts for the tolls!  [Cameron storms out, as well.]
On the other hand, prescribed to W. Brown.
Could be, but the prescribing doc, his name’s real.  This guy’s just had his license pulled for writing illegal prescriptions to high school kids.
And Mr. Brown’s birth date makes him 17-years-old.  You think maybe these were confiscated by a high school guidance counselor?  [He pockets the bottle.]  Anything else?
He’s getting older.  What did the CSF say about encephalitis?
Which means we’re back to Alzheimer’s.
Well, then you should have told her that.  He could still have it.  PET scan will reveal any change in metabolic activity in the cerebral cortex, run him through.  And check his memory.
I like all the pretty lights. [The tech injects the chemical, and Mark starts to enter the machine.]
Jeez, what a guy.  His frontal lobe is working way better than mine. [into the mike] You remember when you got married?
What?  There could be a problem with his long-term memory.  [in the mike]  Big church wedding?
He remembers voices.
I thought you skimped on the limbic system, there.  Emotional reactions, I just want to be thorough. [in the mike] Did the atheistic bride wear a pretty, white dress?
What jewelry did your bride wear?
I think I upset him.
A little defensive.
Here we go.  [Stacy shoves him.]
The questions were designed to define the operational parameters of his limbic system –
Medical screwing.  It’s what I do.
I haven’t been up here in five years. [a lengthy, awkward pause]  I don’t know what’s wrong with him.  It’s not Alzheimer’s, it’s not encephalitis, it’s not environmental, it’s not immunological.  Every test is negative, every time.  He’s perfectly healthy, but his brain is dying.
I haven’t given up.
We wait.
Something to change.  It’s one of the great tragedies of life, something always [they break apart], something always changes.
Time marches on.  He’s paralyzed.
It’s peripheral.  Guillain-Barre syndrome attacks there, not the brain.
Initiative!  Like that.  Start him on IV immunosuppress—
Period?  More like dot dot dot.  What if he has the virus but isn’t producing those antibodies?
I didn’t ask about the Vegas line, I said “what if?”
Fatal sounds very bad to me.
The treatment isn’t all that dangerous, plasmapheresis and IVIG.  If it works, we’re right.  If he dies, it was something else.
Stop that.
No, he’s not.  Look at his vitals.  O2 stats are within range.  I’m betting the only abnormal sign is sweaty palms.  [Stacy, still holding his hand, nods.]  Push two milligrams Ativan.  [She pushes it, and Mark calms down.]  Just a panic attack.  Something obviously freaked him out.  Can we talk now?
He’s had five visitors drive down.  I didn’t recognize any of them.  Six more have sent him flowers, candy and a teddy bear, which I’m sure he finds very comforting.  But I didn’t recognize any of the names on the cards.
No, it’s not shocking that you have new friends.  But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones.
No, I didn’t think so.  I just think you didn’t tell any of them that you were down here.  Now why would that be?  [A doctor comes to use the telephone at the desk; they move to another spot.]  Why would you not tell your oldest friends that you were taking Mark to Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital to try to save his life?
See, my old friends are telling me to be careful.   They seem to think –
Figures.  He seems to think that I’m not over you.  It might be dangerous for me to spend time with you.  I’m thinking your friends might have similar concerns.  And so you didn’t tell him you’d be here, with me.
No.
Love the bear, it was adorable.
I got Mark’s latest blood work, he’s not responding to treatment.
I was happy.  He’s my patient.  I’m sure he’s a good guy, he’s probably a great guy.  Probably a much better guy than I am.  And some part of me wants him to die.  I’m just not sure if it’s because I want to be with her or if it’s because I want her to suffer.
Hey.  Is it okay if I talk to Stacy for a minute?
You two are good together.
He took you to Paris, that’s good enough for me.
Your honeymoon.  It’s been your dream city, you wanted to go since you were sixteen, he actually took you.
When did Mark switch from mountain biking to yoga?
We have two more symptoms.
Patient was asked a series of questions to determine the functionality of his brain.
Whatever.  Yeah, point is he told us everything we needed to know to diagnose him, that is if we use your fancy PET scan as a lie detector.  See, it’s a very creative process, lying.  Now, telling the truth is a much simpler process.  See here.  Question nine, this is where Mark gives a long, rambling answer about taking Stacy to Paris.  What does the PET scan say?
They didn’t go.  They didn’t go to Paris, and yet Mark’s brain apparently thinks that he really did spend 40 francs on a tour of the Bastille.  [He starts to erase the white board.] So we have an intermittent syndrome that presents with abdominal pain, polyneuropathy, paranoia and delusions.  Now, here’s the thing about Acute Intermittent Porphyria.  It’ll jump you in a dark alley, beat the crap out of you, leave you bleeding.  But it leaves gloves, so no fingerprints.  Doesn’t show up in blood tests, urine tests, nothing.  Unless you catch it red handed in the middle of an attack.
Such as?
Yeah, well, one of the true tragedies of this condition is it makes you want to stick your cool, new mountain bike in the garage and take up an indoor sport like, say, yoga.  Start the treatment: hematin and glucose.
Sure there is.
Acute Intermittent Porphyria has very specific triggers.  Barbiturates, alcohol, high levels of protein set off an attack.
Not the faintest idea, that’s why I’m going to give him the combo plate.
Yeah.  But then we’ll know what it is and we can treat it.
No idea.  If we don’t know what’s messing up your brain we don’t know how you’ll react.
No idea.  Next attack could be fatal.  Could be six months from now, could be five minutes from now.
Fine.  I’ll send for a HMB synthetase mutation, genetic test.  Lab will get back to us in a month.
No.
Because he doesn’t want me to.
He might.
I’m not gonna do it.
You keep asking me that question; my answer doesn’t change.  I gave him the parameters, it’s his call.
I diagnosed him, I did my job.  You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment, well, you’re way better at that than I am.
Yeah, maybe.
No, he’s going to die because he’s too stubborn to make the right choice.
I’m respecting your husband’s decision, I don’t see why you’ve got a problem with that.
He’ll never forgive you.
[at the doorway] Boy, are my ears burning.
[holding up a syringe] Cocktail hour.  Just because you can’t hoist a few doesn’t mean you should be left out.
Smart.  Too bad you’re paralyzed.  [He takes the IV to push the syringe, but Foreman stops him.]  Bing!  Paging Dr. Foreman!  Leave the room.  It’s not your problem.
Doc, he ain’t right in the head!
Okay, then get one.  We’ll wait here.  I won’t do nothin’.  [The three Ducklings have moved so they’re forming a wall between House and Mark’s bed.]  Oh, love the Musketeer thing.  I got goosebumps.
So what’s your plan?  You take the big, dark one, I’ve got the little girl and the Aussie will run like a scared wombat if things turn rough.  I can’t do it.  [He turns away, everyone relaxes, and then BOOM!  House sticks the syringe in Mark’s leg.]
See what I did there?
Everyone’s different.
No, you’ll pollute the sample!  Chase, get urine from the catheter.
This is not a stroke!  Delta wave bursts just at the base of the spasm.  [The catheter falls to the floor.]
Hold him down!
No pain killers!
Straight from the bladder, that’s as fresh as it gets.  Will you give him the Ativan already?  He doesn’t need to be awake for this.
[grabbing a lamp] Move.
Organic chem..  More lights, more oxidation.  Ring any bells?  [The sample turns black.]  Start the patient on 150 milligrams glucose, 75 milligrams hematin.  [The three younger doctors leave, leaving House alone to breathe.]
[looking in again] Never better.
De nada.
He’s gonna be fine.
So I’m the guy, but you want the other guy, who by definition can never be the guy.
Okay. [Stacy kisses him on the cheek, then leaves.]
[loudly] I will not have sex with you!  Not again!  Miserable, that first time.  All that desperate, administrative need –
Did she say yes?
Fine.  Good.
Who are you, and why are you wearing a tie?
Yes. I would like to know why she gets a secretary and I don’t.
Hmm. I didn’t know they had a secretarial school. Well, I hope you took some classes in sexual harassment law. Does the word “ka-ching” mean anything to you? I’m going in now. [House enters.]
What’s with hiring a male secretary? JDate not working out?
She’s not like you. She can’t just walk into a bar and pick up her soul mate in twenty minutes.
You met me at a strip club.
What was I supposed to do? Ask her to leave? That’s just rude. Death row guy. I want the case.
No, but “partypants” does.
Hardly counts as stealing; it’s a pretty obvious choice.
Nolo? Well, I don’t want to say anything bad about another doctor, but… especially a useless drunk…
But I’m not useless. Tell Nolo I’m talking over.
Oh, good. I’m sure he’ll explore all the usual options for why a guy’s heart starts beating so fast it pumps out air instead of blood. Wait a second – there are no usual options!
I will give you two more clinic hours this week.
The patient’s not talking to anybody.
You are going to the clinic for two hours.
Talk to Cuddy. She’s got me going to Mercer State Prison, Capital Sentences unit, I don’t know.
Good question. What makes a person deserving? Is a man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a man who kills his wife?
What about a child molester? Certainly not a good guy, but he didn’t kill anybody. Maybe he can get antibiotics, but no MRIs. What about you? What medical care should you be denied for being a car thief? Tell you what: the three of you work out a list of what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed. I’ll review it when I get back. [House leaves the hospital. Chase and Foreman exit the lobby, which leaves Cameron to do the clinic hours.]
Relax, I’ve got a great bedside manner.
And yet, you’re staying out there.
Bluish tinge to the fingernails, lips… he’s hypoxic.
It means he’s not getting enough oxygen. You know how people say you can’t live without love? Well, oxygen’s even more important. He’s got fluid in his lungs, breathing rate of 50… he needs to be intubated and put on a respirator.
Better get one in about an hour, or you’re gonna lose him.
[flipping open his cell phone] I think the state was a tad more specific about “how”. [on the phone] This is Dr. Gregory House. I need an ambulance to pick-up at Mercer State Prison.
You work fast.
Was that a shot?
Stop, I’m getting turned on.
[in his best Scooby-Doo imitation] Ruh-row!
Did you do something to your hair?
Come on. You’ve known me how long and you still don’t know when I’m joshin’ ya?
No, can’t. See, ironically I’m bound by this court order which your ace attorney got. I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him. Is it just me, or is that weird? Anyway, we’re walking.
Somebody left this on my chair. It’s clever. Forces me to either deal with the file or never sit down again.
You shouldn’t have told her that. She’s got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, six months, tops.
No, just guessing. It’s a new game. If I’m wrong, she gets a stuffed bear.
I love children. So filled with hope.
Could be, if she didn’t already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung.
Exactly. Personally, I think it’s all just new-age crap, but from your tear-filled, puppy-dog eyes I think I’ve made my point. Now go tell Cindy Whatever-her-name-is that she’s dying. [He walks into Diagnostics, where Chase and Foreman are sitting.] Tachycardia, pulmonary edema, likely suspects?
God, I’ve got to learn not to beat around the bush. By dying, I meant no matter what we do. Very, very soon she is going to be dead. Is it still to subtle?
Yeah, well, it’s not like they make you sign it or anything.
He stays here and we don’t treat him, he dies, and I still don’t treat Cindy Lou-Who.
Yeah, I knew I could count on your help for your homie.
Makes sense to me.
The man knows prisons. When we’ve got a yachting question, we’ll come to you. Okay, drugs it is. Test his hair, blood, urine, the works. [Chase and Foreman get up, Cameron still has her angry face on. House makes an “after you” motion with his hand.]
What’s the differential for being thirsty?
Don’t do that.
Nope. Only I get to write on the board. [I’ll just take this moment to say that I love that the board is titled “Dead Man Dying”. All right, go on.] So it’s not drugs. What else can cause the heart to do wind sprints? You got the blood work back, any – [Stacy walks into his office and looks at him through the wall] – thing out of the ordinary?
Yeah, but which column? Could be the result of the tachycardia, could be the cause?
Why, because you want it to be? Let’s see how well that works with your other patient.
Right, buff his numbers. Don’t bother trying to figure out the underlying cause. I thought you cared about patients.
[closing the blinds so he can’t see Stacy] Our job is to diagnose him. What? Mommy and Daddy are having a little fight, it doesn’t mean we stop loving you. Now, go outside and play. Get Daddy some smokes and an arterial blood gas test. [They all exit. As House leaves, he nearly runs into Stacy, who does not look amused.] Wow. That was impressive. Okay, what number am I thinking of?
I just don’t want you working right here, in my office. But anywhere else in the building is fine. It’s a big hospital.
God, I hope that was a euphemism.
I hope that one means what I think it means.
The number was six, by the way.
If I hadn’t lied to you about Cuddy’s approval, my patient would be dead.
Which means two things. Most importantly, Cameron was wrong about the bi-carb, and less significantly, we have a new symptom. Anion gap acidosis. Who’s chubby? Come on, pretend he loves puppies. Pretend he’s a human being. What’ve you got?
What “something else” could lead to anion gap acidosis?
Well, you don’t have to ask. Just wash your hands before you come back.
Oh, it’s a mnemonic. That makes sense, too.
Rewind.
Yahtzee!
Clever entrepreneur like Foreman here, chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.
Who wants to head over to the prison and find Clarence’s secret stash? [No one looks too thrilled.]
Great, Chase it is.
You’ve got a prettier mouth. Better chance the inmates will open up to you.
He didn’t mind. I asked.
Why do you think they put TVs in coma patients’ rooms, anyway?
So leave them a radio. His eyes are closed; who thinks they can see? [Wilson sits on the opposite side of the bed.]
Oh, I know this one. Because people are good, decent and caring. Either that, or people are cowards. If I’m mean to you, you’ll be mean to me. Mutually assured destruction.
You gonna get to your point?
I don’t care if people like me.
Look I know you’re friends with her, but there is a code. Bros before hos, man. [He sticks his fist out, but his pager beeps. After looking at it -- ] Crap.
Death Row guy is dying.
Are you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?
Right. Don’t know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin. They’re just gonna have to have to take more. [He starts to push the Atropine into the IV.]
Just get out of here. [Foreman leaves as Clarence’s heart rate starts to climb.]
[from the hospital desk near Diagnostics] Did you beat any confessions out of anybody?
Does anybody do their jobs anymore?
I appreciate your candor. Did you even go to the prison or are you just out playing polo?
Unless he finished it.
Call it off. Come on back.
You’re dying. [ -- and takes out a bottle of rum and pours two shots’ worth.] A man deserves a last drink.
Thanks. That means a lot. [He helps Clarence to drink his shot.]
[slurred slightly] Thought you convicts knew how to drink. You’re at least three shots behind. [He looks as if he’s going to offer a shot to Clarence, but drinks it himself.] Now you’re four shots behind.
Little busy right now. Getting my drink on.
I could’ve hit that.
Eh.
Tell me something, I’ve been trying to figure this out. Why does a guy – [He gives Clarence another shot] – who’s on Death Row suddenly try to off himself? I know you drank that copier fluid. It’s not as visually dramatic as slitting your wrists with a homemade shiv, but it’ll do the trick.
[pouring more rum] And that thought just came to you. Just like that.
Mmm. Well, look. Here’s the good news. The copier fluid you drank contains about 90% methanol, which is very poisonous and you took more than enough to kill yourself. The bad news is the alcohol you just drank contains so much ethanol that it’s gonna bind with that nasty formic acid raging through your body, and you’re just gonna pee it out. Harmlessly.
Yes, I am. I also saved your life. [And, a shot for House! Laughing] At least for now.
No, you just have a very grating voice.
Why are you talking to me?
Absolutely. [He walks into the elevator. Oh elevator, I’ve missed you! The door of the elevator almost closes, but House stops it with his cane, and it opens again.] Can I trust you?
I still think the patient’s sick. I’m keeping him here. Now, either you can do your job and keep the hospital informed, or you can help me make sure the hospital is not informed and buy me some time. [The door closes.]
[entering] She’s done everything she needs to do except tell her patient that she’s dying. I told you, only I get to play with the markers. [He erases what she wrote.] Our prisoner has a new symptom.
I’m not buying that CLARENCE is trying to take control of his life by suicide. Healthy people don’t kill themselves.
Guy just filed an appeal in a state that hasn’t actually killed anybody in about 30 years.
Excellent. Explains everything, except the symptom that got him here. His heart went nuts before he got stuck in that storage cell and chugged a toner martini. I think there’s something going on in his head. Check for intracranial lesions, brain infections, autoimmune diseases… do a CT, LP, full workup. State’s paying, so go nuts. [They all leave, Cameron in a huff.]
Oh no. Now you’ve left your entire body in my chair. What does that mean you want?
I take it the CT with contrast came back.
Biopsy would be.
And definitive. But you don’t want definitive, you want to hang on to your delusions as long as you can.
But you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch. The answer is no.
Great. Let’s treat her.
Wow, that is remarkable. According to those patchouli-oli selling new-agers, it’s supposed to be the terminal patient, but you’re going through the five stages. You just made a completely seamless transition from anger to bargaining. Cover two more of my clinic hours, and you can have your one procedure. [Cameron nods and leaves.]
Yeah, sorry. Just gotta get him stabilized. Probably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes.
Figuring requires deductive reasoning. I’m figuring that you did no figuring. Stacy just ratted me out, right? So much for attorney-client privledge.
Right.
Whoa, can’t. Court order.
Where does it hurt?
Well, he’d know. Let me take a look.
I don’t think he’s faking this stuff. What do you think, Doctor? [Clarence screams a lot more for emphasis.]
No, you had to tell Cuddy. She’s your boss, I get it. Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too.
Gandhi didn’t march the sea because his buddies asked him too, Pol Pot didn’t wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends.
I trusted you.
Wilson’s a fool. I’m an idiot.
It’s the only reason anybody does anything.
I wonder. I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate.
Everything we do is dictated by motive. [As he erases the white board] Why did he kill his girlfriend?
Is that the reason he gave?
Jealousy. [He writes it on the board.] That gets him sent to prison, where he kills inmate number one. Why?
Revenge. Who’d he killed after that?
Who had a file full of abusive complaints. Probably been kicking Clarence’s ass for months.
Call that one “retribution”. Then he kills inmate number two. Anybody know why? [Chase looks through the file.] Nuh-uh. It’s not in there. [He draws a giant question mark.]
It’s an anomaly. Doctors love anomalies. Dark spot on an x-ray, bright spot on an MRI…. Killing that second inmate is the homicidal equivalent of blood in the urine. It doesn’t fit. I’m interested in things that don’t fit. Tell me why you did it. Your other victims you were almost bragging about. What was different about this guy?
So what’s the differential for raging out?
Prep Clarence for surgery.
Oh, come on. Do I have to spell it out for you? Pheochromocytoma. Actually, I’m not sure how you spell it. [Ed. – But I do!] But you said it yourself, adrenaline. Pheochomocytoma sits on top of the adrenal gland, randomly spits out oodles of the stuff. It’s perfect, it explains everything. The tachycardia, pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that caused the necrotic bowel –
I love rare. Set up an MRI. Where’s Cameron? [They shrug.] Like I don’t know.
I don’t even remember. It’s just a fancy way of saying small, adrenaline-secreting tumor. Yeah, that clarified it for you. All you need to know is if I’m right, we can fix it. Just gotta to find it first. We need an MRI. It’s completely painless for most people.
I assume you got those tattoos in prison. Prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals. The MRI’s basically a giant magnet. It’d suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.
Stop squirming. Don’t make us do this again. Big baby.
There’s Waldo. Found it, Clarence.
Keep him in there until you guys see it too. [He leaves.]
Clarence goes back to Death Row.
He’s cured.
My God, you’re right! Let’s call the surgeons, we’ve got to save that tumor. Put it on the witness stand.
[sniffs] You smell that? I think that is the stink of hypocrisy. You wouldn’t even consider the notion that Clarence’s social upbringing was responsible for what he became, but now you’re sprinting to the witness stand to blame everything on a little tumor.
Yeah. See, you only overcame one of them. Well, let’s just give Clarence a free pass, hmmm? Which, is probably going to piss off all those other pheo sufferers who managed to control their rage attacks and become lawyers, race car doctors, or even doctors. Removing that tumor puts a stop to those random shots adrenaline, it doesn’t absolve him.
That’s not what I’m saying.
Everyone’s got an opinion. [Foreman turns to leave as “Hallelujah”, the most overused great song in media begins to play.]
You’ll do what you think is right. On your own time. [He leaves.]
Uh uh, forget it. I’m going home.
Boy, you must be a doctor and everything!
No, the purple thingy on the file means that “whoever” is one of yours, which means cancer, which means no way is it two minutes.
Mystery of life.
I already did 1000 milligrams. [He sneezes]
Why Jimmy. We’ll talk about this in the morning.
Not yet.
So the Rhabdo’s in her brain. Make her comfortable she’s got about a week.
The cancer’s in remission? Which means the hallucinations are unconnected.
No. It’ll just fly by.
Don’t worry, anything happens to you nobody’s is going to lift a finger. Differential diagnosis on your marks, get set…
Whoa. Wait for it… [Pause] and go.
What a guy.
[Looking at the scan] But where there’s infection there’s meningial swelling.
True. Get a tox screen and MRI.
Sounds good.
Yes, there is a third option — she’s making it all up because she doesn’t want to get in trouble for breaking a mirror. Unfortunately we can’t test for that so… [He looks at Chase] Tox screen, MRI and you [He looks at Cameron] stay away from the patient.
Oh well, you’d just get all warm and cuddly around the dying girl and insinuate yourself; end up in a custody battle. Chase you handle the mom. Tell her that you’d just sit home and watch TV and die, but you’re going to go though the motions of trying to save her daughters life. It’s a doctor thing. [They begin to exit and he sips the tea] What the hell is this?
It’s nice.
Whoa look at the time I should have been out of here 20 minutes ago.
Can’t slip anything by you can I.
I’m taking a sick day.
Everyone’s a doctor suddenly.
Union rules. I can’t check out this guy’s seeping gonorrhea this close to lunch.
Well it’s sexist and a very dangerous precedent; if people could choose the sex of their doctors you gals would be out of business.
Sore throat? [We see the patient holding an open book in front of him, he removes it to reveal blood stained pants] Well it’s not lupus. Well not everyone can operate a zipper; the up, the down. What comes next?
Aha, and you wanted Rivkah to feel all gemutlicht. I get it it’s a shandah.
Just like Abraham did it.
Stop talking. I’m gonna get a plastic surgeon. Get the Twinkie back in the wrapper.
Oxygen saturation is 94%, check her heart.
It’s off by one percentage point.
If her DNA was off by one percentage point she’d be a dolphin. We’ve got a patient, who for no obvious reason is hallucinating. Since it’s not obvious, I thought we’d go with subtle.
Welcome to the end of the thought process.
I’m going home. While I’m resting you guys get some arterial blood gasses. Once you confirm she is hypoxic I want a plethysmography, Chest X-ray, CT and VQ. And if all that comes back negative then snake a catheter into her lungs. Don’t worry, I don’t sleep in. I’ll get bagels.
Bagels.
Didn’t sleep. Didn’t breathe. I’m dying.
Which gives us no explanation for the diminished sat percentage.
Sometime we can’t see why normal isn’t normal. Get her symptoms on the board.
It’s written down in my advanced health care directive, should I be incapacitated in any way you run the board, then Foreman. Chase you’re just not ready yet. What else?
Yeah, all girls who’ve been molested want to talk about it. Break out the rape kit.
Why are you so sure?
You read her diary too?
I rest my case. A regular nine year old girl does not have sex on the brain, not when a doctor is threading a catheter through her vein.
Cancer doesn’t make you special. Molestation on the other hand…
Tell that to all the hookers who won’t kiss me on the mouth. Hey, here’s a theory, she has been molested, seeks refuge in romantic fantasies with older men with great hair. And I think you left out the punch line, victims of molestation learn to work the angles. Manipulate people. You did it didn’t you. You kissed her.
This is exactly why you can’t touch my markers. Go see if she’s had sex.
Is she dying?
Then she can wait.
If only she’d been molested then we’d have something to go on. [He tries to open a jar of mentholatum] No forced entry.
She’s not fine. Her sat percentage dropped another point.
Lung wouldn’t explain the hallucination. CT scan showed both lungs were clean, which means there’s a tumor in her heart.
I loosened it.
Give me one other explanation for low oxygen saturation.
Perfect let’s go with that.
What’s the rate of cancer in the general population? 1 in 10,000?
The way I figure it 1 in 10,000 of them should have another cancer. Little girl won the lottery twice. It happens.
Exploratory surgery, gotta find this thing.
I know it's somewhere near the heart.
Better acoustics. Now listen to this.
No, get the wax out of your ears. This is the patient’s aortic valve. I downloaded the audio of her echocardiogram.
Tumor.
But we could hear an abnormality in the sound of the valve, which would indicate the presence of something; a tumor for example. If we can tell the surgeon where to look this is no longer exploratory surgery it’s a precision strike.
Too bad. Now listen to the dulcet tones of Andie’s tricuspid valve.
And this is her mitral valve.
You guys make me sad. Listen again.
Because Wilson thinks it’ll be nice to give the girl a year to say good bye to her mommy. I guess maybe she stutters or something. Now shut up and listen. Tricuspid. Mitral. Again.
I’m gonna ask the surgeon to look at the mitral valve first. Chase, I want you there. I don’t like reading surgeons reports, they’re boring.
She’ll be unconscious you’ll be safe.
Sure. Brave. She’s a wonder.
These cancer kids; you can’t put them all on a pedestal. It’s basic statistics some of them have to be whiny little fraidy cats.
If there’s not one yellow-belly in the group then being brave doesn’t have any meaning.
You see grace because you wanna to see grace.
Idolizing is pathological with you people. You see things to admire where there’s nothing.
You find things to admire where you shouldn’t be sniffing at all; like Debbie in accounting.
You shouldn’t know that, you’re married.
If you’re dying suddenly everybody loves you.
I’m not terminal, merely pathetic; you wouldn’t believe the crap people let me get away with.
They got the tumor, repaired her heart but she bled out of her eye.
True. The cardiac tumor was benign.
Statistically.
That’s why I’m mentioning it.
This is bad you’re starting to state the obvious.
A nine year old with terminal cancer gets an unrelated benign tumor growing in her heart why?
Talk to Wilson.
The tumor is Afghanistan the clot is Buffalo. Does that need more explanation? Ok the tumor is Al Qaeda. Big bad guy with brains. We went in and wiped it out but it had already sent out a splinter cell; a small team of low level terrorists quietly living in some suburb of Buffalo, waiting to kill us all.
It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest.
Angio was clean.
There’s a clot, we just can’t find it.
Are you sure you’re not a neurologist?
Well the clots not gonna to go away quietly. It could blow at anytime. Are you gonna let them know?
She’s such a brave girl. I want to see how brave she is when you tell her she’s gonna die.
What would you do if you were told you were gonna die?
You’d cry like a baby, everybody would, but she’s not doing anything. She’s a rock.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why?
So what? Does that mean she’s ready to die? What if her bravery is a symptom? The clot is causing hallucinations and messing with her emotions.
Would tell us where to look for the clot. Where’s the fears center?
Then let’s do that.
Is it still illegal to perform an autopsy on a living person?
If it’s Tuesday, I’m wasted.
I want to induce a hypothermic cardiac arrest. Once the patients on bypass we siphon off two liters of blood then perfuse the brain while she’s in an MRI.
Just for a little while, I’ll bring her right back.
If we do nothing she’s dead in a day, maybe a week; the kind that lasts.
Absolutely. If we were doing anything invasive; but there’s nothing invasive. [He almost sneezes] Gah. You know, I’m not cutting into her head I’m just looking for a clot.
Don’t split hairs, if it works she lives.
I’ll see that Wilson passes that along.
Great. Thanks.
I stacked a combo of mentholatum, a few vicodin and something else which I can’t remember. Should be able to ride the high for a couple hours; what did Andie say?
About this.
What if you’re right about her? What if she just is that brave?
Either she understands or she’s not brave. You can’t have it both ways. If she does understand… then she deserves to know what’s going on.
I’m doctor House.
Did your mom tell you what we’re gonna try?
Tomorrow’s test could take ten hours, in your present condition you might not even make it through.
How do you feel about it? If we figured maturity came from how much time you’ve got left instead how long you’ve been here, this would be your call.
I could give you one.
You’ve got cancer. I fix this…
A year of this. A lot of people wouldn’t want that. A lot of people would just want it to be over.
Nobody wants to die. But you’re going to. The question is how, how much you’re gonna suffer and how long. I’m asking if you want this to be over.
I could give her ten excellent medical reasons why we can’t do this procedure.
But you can’t stay for her either.
This is your life, you can’t do this just for her.
Thank you for joining me for tonight’s dress rehearsal. Playing the part of Andie is Morty Randolph. [He gestures at a cadaver] For his donation to science we give our thanks. Once Andie is cool and goes off bypass we have 60 seconds to get 2 liters of blood out of her body and back into her for the pictures to find the clot in her head. IF our star is bumped tomorrow [He barely touches the cadaver and lights start to flash] while my MRI is on these red lights will go off which will mean we have no useable test results. No test results; its goodbye Broadway. You guys will be wearing bad cat suits in Des Moines. Neurosurgeons here, with a view of the monitors. Cardiac surgeon there, in case we need to open her up. Anesthesiologists, one by the cardiac bypass machine, one by the cooling apparatus. Girls in the chorus if you’re over 5’ 10” stick with me. Okay give me 60 seconds on the clock. Showtime. A five, six, seven, eight… siphon off the blood through the arterial line WHOOSH, sound of blood draining. More whoosh. Glug, glug, glug and we… [Red lights] Kill her. Again.
How hard can this be?
Again!
Again!
Again!
Gruesome and low tech. Kiss me I love it. A five, six, seven, eight…
This’ll make you sleep.
Big musical number kiddo; a lot of people here to make you look good.
Okay go.
Start the cooling. You. Go.
200 milligrams of vecuronium.
What? She’s dead; that’s the whole idea. Go.
Okay put the blood back in; reperfuse the circuit.
Anything people? Anything at all?
Keep looking.
I didn’t see anything.
Are you sure?
That’s good enough for me.
Diphenhydramine. Antihistamine. New delivery system; it’s a blood brain barrier thing.
I know my way around a razor blade.
Just a couple more rocks.
Right, parade of the small bald circus freaks. Sorry, I got a thing.
Oh?
Yeah.
Yeah. I was wrong; she genuinely is a self sacrificing saint whose life will bring her nothing but pain, which she will stoically withstand just so that her mom doesn’t have to cry quite so soon. I’m beside myself with joy. [He does a line] Whoa!
Right.
I’m pacing myself; unlike her I have the luxury of time.
I’m not gonna kiss you no matter what you say. [She hugs him]
Huh?
No thanks. [He starts to leave and then turns back] Could I test drive one of these things?
Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck. Could have pinged on the ulnar…[House is staring down at a red stain on Cuddy’s tank top just below her breasts.] Sorry, trouble concentrating. That tank top really absorbs moisture.
Could have pinged the ulnar nerve, cut the blood flow. Or it could be
Trauma can activate the clotting enzymes. Guy could loose more than his hand.
Cervical MRI, work up for DIC, and start him on a heparin drip
You want to know his name? [throws file down on the table] I’m sure it’s in the file.
Or you could ask her. She’s his oldest, bestest friend. They were in Cub Scouts together.
You haven’t been a real doctor in ten years, you’ll make a mess all over the sheet.
Get me blood. Lots of blood.
They’re better. They’ve showered.
Well, obviously not that mild. This keeps up and his hand will literally be dead meat. His hand is connected to his arm, his arm is connected to…I’m not sure, but I bet it’s important.
Yeah, if only he’d fallen on his head. Then he wouldn’t have any of these symptoms.
Looks like Cuddy, same cleavage. Protein C is indicated only for severe sepsis.
But this stuff is crazy dangerous. It can cause internal bleeding. If he bleeds, he could stroke, he could die.
You know, if I tried a scheme like this, you’d give me that nasty, wrinkly face and screech like a hyena. [House approached Cuddy until he is barely a foot away.] It’s very sexy, I admit.
Protein C is border-line irresponsible. ‘Cept that the safe stuff isn’t doing squat.
Well, obviously.
You seriously thought I wanted to stop her?
No, first causality of this case is her sense of humor.
The good news is he won’t be bitching about losing his hand if he can’t breathe.
Right, I forgot. Your roof.
The only question is why?
Why her weird psychopathology requires a diagnosis formed entirely by personal guilt. Let’s assume we’ve been wrong up until now. Let’s assume, just for one second, that the earth doesn’t revolve around Cuddy’s roof. What if he was sick before he had his run-in with gravity? He just didn’t notice anything.
Sure, only pavement hits that fast. It’s not pneumonia. Might have missed a finger turning dark, he’s not going to miss breathing problems. What else?
Well, why didn’t you just take out a gun and shoot him?
Might have mentioned this earlier, Doctor. Maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab, instead of wasting a day indulging your self-loathing.
So give him garden-variety Levaquin and a garden-variety echo-cardiogram. And go check out the kid’s house.
If he’s huffing nail polish, or pulling the wings off his pet parrot, this way will be faster. I bet Julio is just dying to find out what’s wrong with him. [nods to Cameron]. Go with her.
Rico and I no longer trust you deciding what’s important and what’s not.
Trust me. It would be a lot worse if I told her you have to break into her house.
See, it is shocking. Guy’s been working there every day for the last three weeks. Do you think it’s impossible that he could have picked something up?
I’m your boss.
Oh, she’s a woman. Relax, I’m coming with.
What do you think? Red thongs? I think red thongs. ‘Kay…
Twenty bucks says I can get through this door in twenty seconds.
Someone as obsessive and insecure as Cuddy probably has three extra keys hidden within ten feet of the door.
Insecticide is organic, soap is hypoallergenic.
I got the bedroom.
This is where it all happens.
Does this count as red?
Oh my God. She’s got pictures of you in here.
Just you. It’s like some kind of weird shrine.
Yeah.
She uses super tampons. What does that mean?
Hey, I can be a jerk to people I haven’t slept with. I am that good.
Whoa. Check this out. It’s fuzzy. It’s black. It’s alive.
I’m glad you learned to take his impending death in stride.
Scars on his hand…
But he says they’re from construction work so he won’t have to admit he’s got rats in the home. Catholics are right. Pride will kill you.
Boogy, oggy, oogy.
It’s certainly one possibility. What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?
You ought to clean your bathroom better.
No, that would be wrong. I had a key.
You’re right I’m right. On the bright side, it has the advantage of keeping you totally responsible.
Going the dangerous and aggressive route didn’t work last time. It’s bound to work this time. Start him on the amphotericin.
With a patient.
It’s three-fifteen.
She’s not acting like Cuddy. It’s a pleasure.
Technical term is narcissism. You can’t believe everything is your fault unless you also believe you’re all-powerful.
I don’t believe I can fix everything. I don’t lie awake at night tormented by that fact.
We were talking about Cuddy here.
She enjoys feeling guilty.
My God, it’s contagious. You’re feeling guilty, too.
Commercial’s over.
Snap, crackle, pop. Got some Rice Crispies in there?
You were here yesterday. I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman prescribed medicine, not a miracle. Got to give this stuff more than a day.
On the theory that you didn’t trust him because he’s black…well, I’m going to prescribe the same medicine. See if you fill it this time.
It’s racist because it helps black people more than white people? Well, on behalf of my peeps, let me say, thanks for dying on principle for us.
You know, I have found a difference. Admittedly, it’s a limited sample, but it’s my experience in the last ninety seconds that all black people are morons. Sorry, African-Americans.
Fine. Fine.
I’ll give you the same medicine we give Republicans.
Geez, it’s the cops.
Guess she understands a little English.
That wasn’t a complete waste of time. His reaction shows that you don’t need to clean under your sink. It wasn’t aspergilllus.
There’s still plenty of other cool pneumonias…
Well, that all sucks…
See my lapdog agrees with me. How high?
What about on St. Alban's Day? Only temperature I’m interested in right now is his temperature right now.
Open up.
Okay, let me clarify. Open up and keep it open.
Under your tongue.
You’re using your left hand. Right one hurt?
It really doesn’t hurt? Or you just figure if you say no you’ll get out of the hospital sooner?
You don’t smell too hot.
Your hand is starting to rot.
Why are we here?
Yes, we’re talking about cutting it off, not subdividing it and putting in condos. It’s not a legal issue.
Huh?
What? She says one word and you take her side. You should wait until she at least gives a medical reason. Otherwise I might take it personally.
What underlying problem? You have no idea what the underlying problem is.
Fine. It’s all my fault. Does that make you feel better?
His hand is a cesspool. And the crap is spreading.
Don’t give a damn about his livelihood.
He can’t work as a cripple?
American dream destroyed. Very sad, very emotional. Not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale. You’ve lost perspective, Cuddy. You’ve stopped looking at this as a doctor. You’re acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof. You want to make things right? Too bad. Nothing’s ever right.
I’m happy to report that we’re now so in synch we’re actually wearing each other’s underwear. Chop, chop time.
No, I’m lying. Stupid to do with her in the room, I guess.
We made it.
NO! [throws hands up]. Look. She is making a medical decision based on never wanting to feel regret. You’re making a legal decision on wanting me to be wrong.
You wanted superficial agreement. You wanted everybody’s asses covered. You got it. Now can I do the surgery? Pretty, pretty please?
I’m guessing an old black guy that thinks the CIA invented rap music to make your people want to kill each other.
This isn’t about race. Unless annoying is a race. Is he not getting better?
Oh, relax, Foreman. He already is.
I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.
It’s just a white lie.
Right, I’m a racist. Too bad that idiot will never know for the rest of his long, long life.
I’m getting distracted by the multi-system organ failure. Pinkies are supposed to be pink, right? They’re not called grayies.
But the pinky is weirder…[sits up] What does it tell us?
But at a different time. His blood work indicates mild DIC. What if it’s mild in the way you get out of the ocean, the water clinging to your body makes the sea level drop. It’s technically true, but completely irrelevant.
Endocarditis. His heart’s infected.
Little bacteria cauliflowers clinging to his bowels. Except sometimes they can’t hold on. They go swimming in his bloodstream. Thursday, one breaks off, goes to his right hand. Black fingers, gangrene. Friday’s child heads for the kidneys. We all know what Saturday’s are all about. Party with the left hand. Also explains the fever.
Which either means he is negative or what infection could cause pneumonia and culture negative for endocarditis? Prize value goes down with every clue.
Which are squawking. Give him doxycycline.
I liked you better when you were coming up with wacky drugs for us to try. We give him the doxy now, damnit, maybe we can save his pinky. He can teach his brother how to count all the way to five.
Technically, if I’m wrong, he’ll end up dead. But I take your point. What’s his night job?
Since when do fast food joints allow twelve-year-olds to mop floors?
Really? Looks younger.
What job do you do on Saturday nights?
Wake him up.
Yeah. We need to talk about it.
Donde trabaja su hijo los sábados por la noche? (Where does your son work on Saturday nights?)
Well, because, she’d want to talk to me.
Dígame! (Tell me!)
She says he doesn’t work Saturday nights. Give me the talking juice.
When she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was going to cover for Alfredo at work tonight.
Que hace Alfredo los sábados por la noche? (What does Alfredo do on Saturday nights?)
Saturday nights he goes dancing. Either it’s a lie or he’s dancing with birds.
A dónde? (Where?)
Give her the talking juice.
Odds are, it’s going to be close to his house. Probably an abandoned warehouse or factory. Take the Scooby gang and spread out.
Find somebody who looks like crap, tell him you want to place a bet.
Sayonara!
I already put him on the psittacosis meds. Soon as you left. You’re welcome.
What do you think the record for one-handed juggling is?
Good point.
Hello.
if you’re wallowing in self loathing, I’ve got something that might help.
We’re getting sued.
Ca-ching. The new American dream. Happy ending. Kid’s gonna be just fine.
Cuddy.
Your guilt. It’s perverse, and it makes you a crappy doctor. It also makes you okay at what you do.
Now would the world be a better place if people never felt guilty? Makes sex better. [points to Stacy with his cane] Should have seen her in the last months of our relationship. Lot of guilt. Lot of screaming. I know this wasn’t just because it was your roof. Cuddy…you see the world as it is and you see the world as it could be. What you don’t see is what everybody else sees. The giant, gaping chasm in between.
If you did, you never would have hired me.
You’re not happy unless things are just right. Which means two things. You’re a good boss. And you’ll never be happy.
By the way, why does everybody think you and I had sex? Think there could be something to it? I don’t know.
Think so?
No. No way she could have.
It’s raining.
Selling subscriptions? I heard twenty and you get a new bike.
Really? Crushed under the weight of his own ego?
Well, there was this gal I met in ‘Nam who could blow out a candle without using her –
Good thing he’s not the syphilis expert.
Second to his own. Okay. [Closes chart] It’s not TB.
Oh, you want specifics?
Patients aren’t usually part of the diagnostic process.
[writing on the board] Wow, how can you sleep at night?
Yeah, I know. I saw the concert. Seriously, let’s say you sleep six hours; that means every night you kill 1440 people. I guess you got to get some sleep, but come on, if you’d stayed up another 10 minutes you could have saved 40 lives. Do you send notes to the families in the morning? That’s going to take at least ten minutes so that’s another 40 dead, another 40 notes…. Why don’t you go wrack yourself with guilt in your own room?
Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor why it’s not a good idea for the patient to be here.
That’ll be very useful if we need somebody to say the words, “I think it’s TB.” [He sniffs.] What is that?
Who thinks it smells like an elephant dung smoothie?
That is exactly why the patient shouldn’t be in the room. If you can’t tell a man that his cologne makes you want to puke, how are you going to tell him that he’s an idiot?
Sure, you say that now, while he’s in the room.
Nope. The symptoms are too varied.
Told you he’s an idiot. You said you wanted a second opinion.
Yeah, doesn’t look good if you drop dead while wearing your shoes sponsor’s logo.
Wouldn’t want that. [Sebastian’s cell rings. He answers it.]
The nameless poor have a face, and it’s a pompous white man. [Cameron enters.]
[looking at his yo-yo] I can’t remember how to do Walk the Dog. The guy’s sick, he may be dying. We’ve forgotten all about doing a differential diagnosis.
I had to get him out of there. Now we can all sit around and call him an idiot. Who wants to go first?
Well, by that logic, everyone in the hospital should be treated.
TB takes years to kill you. Two weeks ago he was perfectly healthy, now he’s got a white board full of symptoms.
Welcome aboard the Good Ship Asskisser. [Chase glares.] Nice day for a sail. Pucker up, me hearties.
Obviously big as all out doors.
It’s subtle, but it’s there.
Loose throttle. Sometimes beats too fast, sometimes too slow.
Treat him like every other hospital patient. I want to see that pious, body powered toosh hanging out of his gown.
Every minute that we refuse to love one another, another puppy cries another tear.
And yet I’ve nailed more Swedish babes. Crazy, crazy world.
Seriously? No wonder everyone’s going after that peace thing. [The elevator dings, and they walkout into the hospital lobby.]
McDonald’s makes a better hamburger than your mother because they make more?
Yup, that’s the reason. Nobel invented dynamite. I won’t accept his blood money.
Hmmm. We spent a week doing ‘top of head’ in Anatomy. I know just where it is. [He sticks his fingers right against her sinuses, and she flinches. (Ed. – And I flinch in sympathy.)]
Eh, close enough for clinic. Your sinuses are clogged. Judging by the scratches on your hands, I’m guessing a new cat.
You keep a dead cat?
Oh. Poor cat. You’re allergic. We can control it with antihistamine, one pill a day.
You don’t like to swallow. Not surprised. Forget the pills. I’ll give you a nasal spray.
Well, if you lived by the river, I’ve got a bag.
But his EKG was not normal.
Two for you, one for me. We need a tie-breaker.
Tilt-table test.
Bet you a week’s clinic duty it does.
You like this guy? [And up.]
Medically, it’s irrelevant. [Down.] That says something about you. [Up.]
Yes. There’s an evolutionary imperative why we give a crap about our family and friends. And there’s an evolutionary imperative why we don’t give a crap about anybody else. If we loved all people indiscriminately, we couldn’t function.
Just not as honest about it.
What does this knobby thing do?
The way I figure it is, if this could show you problems at 6, imagine what could happen if you crank it to10. [The table starts going up and down much faster.]
Does it go to 11?
I win.
I’m not talking about the nausea. [He points to the screen with the readout.]
Hey, I have feelings. I’m trying my best. Isn’t that enough for you?
Well, thank God we found out before we put the pacemaker in. And thank God you dragged him into a stairwell to get his heart racing.
Because he’s been talking to Foreman. [The phone rings.]
Excellent briefing.
Get an MRI. [Picks up phone] Hello? Oh, I’m sorry, I’ll be right down. No problem, I’ll do an extra hour to make up. I’m late for my clinic duty. Here, go be me for a couple hours. [He tosses Foreman his nametag, looking smug.]
Did I ask you to plant a PPD?
Well, of course he’s got TB! The guy’s been in the jungle for 20 years! If he tested positive for pink-eye would you think that was his big problem?
Because now he’s got the big red target on his arm, the stubborn jerk thinks he’s right! He won’t let us do any more tests.
Not everything!
You’re right. Got to treat the TB.
You’d like that, wouldn’t you? [Cameron leaves.]
I’m complicated.
He’s not even a real doctor, he’s a human telethon.
You think I have a hypocritical attitude to hypocrisy? The problem is there are 26 letters in the alphabet and he only uses two of them. He treats thousands of patients with one diagnosis. He knows the answer going in. It’s cheating.
Oh, did I hurt the big time oncologist’s itty bitty feelings? [House, at this point, start covering his steak with salad greens.] You’re a big help to patients who actually have cancer. Other times you’re just annoying. [Cuddy walks up.]
I’ll say. My salad’s covering a free t-bone steak.
Last week they said it was “Mystery Stew”, they owe me.
Then it probably wasn’t.
Let me ask you something: if this were another doctor, if this patient were complaining about, let’s say, I don’t know, Foreman, you’d just dismiss this as the paranoid bitching of another paranoid bitch and file it under ‘P’ for –
Am not.
Good.
I have no idea. [to the cashier] Just a salad today, big breakfast.
So he won’t take the pills.
And he won’t agree to any more tests.
See what happens when you don’t listen to me?
Yeah, that’s my point. Increased heart rate, night sweats, loss of consciousness… besides rough sex, what do they all have in common?
It’s not TB!
[on phone] In my opinion, Dr. Sebastian Charles is an idiot. Yeah, you can quote me. C-u-d-d-y. [Chase and Foreman laugh to themselves.]
Sebastian is refusing life-saving treatment.
He won’t let me test him.
Hold him down.
Trust me; she doesn’t want to hear it from me. Look, the guy is killing himself, am I the only one who realizes this is a bad thing? [Cuddy begins to put on lipstick.] If he was a Christian Scientist refusing meds we’d have 18 attorneys…. You’re putting on make-up. That’s not a good sign for my side, is it?
You are as big a media whore as he is.
Oh, whores can like the sex. Doesn’t mean they’re not whores. And with that eye shadow… I am totally screwed, aren’t I?
You want third-world treatment? [turns up the thermostat] You got it. Boy, is it hot here in Jani!
What am I doing? [He knocks all of Sebastian’s things off of the tray of the bed.] Putting everything on the floor of the hut. Uh oh, wicked magic box with the moving pictures!
[unplugging the TV] Hypocrite? No, everyone in Africa’s got cell phones or running water. [Speaking of cell phones, it just got dropped in the toilet. It’s a tight fit, though, so House prods it down the hole with his cane.] Hah, this thing just will not flush.
[wiping his cane on Sebastian’s blanket] Lousy sanitation over there, too. You are not the same as them; your life is not the same. And you are cheapening everything they’re going through by pretending you are.
You can’t demand to be treated like any third-world sick person and call a press conference!
[keeps snapping] Sure, they’re dying, but it’s got a great beat.
Yup. [Foreman enters.]
He’s in a coma. I need you to apologize to Ceci, Cecily…
For whatever I did.
That has been my position all along.
Do you notice how all the self-sacrificing women in history – Joan of Arc, Mother Theresa, can’t think of any others – they all die alone. The men on the other hand get so much fuzz it’s crazy.
Insulting a woman with breast cancer – that’s a move best left to the pros. Frankly, you don’t have the chops.
What did you do, call ‘em perky? You are years away from mad skills [Ed. – m4d sk1llz?] like that. I need you to apologize.
Welcome to the world. Everyone’s different, everyone gets treated different. You try fighting that, you end up dying of TB. [House hits the TV.]
Testing the patient’s autonomic nervous system.
His internal heating and ventilation should be off, shouldn’t be able to sweat. That’s why he’s got that awful body powder. Take it away, crank up the heat, stick him under the lights, can’t cool himself. He should be turning bright red.
He’s sweating like a pig.
He’s disoriented.
His arteries are clamping down. [A monitor starts beeping.]
Get the crash cart, he’s having a cardiac arrest! [More beeping.]
[in the camera’s face] That is not TB!
I want to treat you for TB. Dr. Cameron found low sugar in your cerebrospinal fluid. It’s a classic finding of TB.
Nah. If TB caused cardiac arrest on a hot day, your work in Africa would be even more futile than it already is.
That white board in my office, we’re up to about a dozen symptoms now. Cardiac arrest, clearly not TB. CSF sugar clearly is TB. The rest of them could go either way. Unless we know which ones are which I can’t diagnose you. [He holds out the pills, which Sebastian takes and places on the tray next to him.]
So you’re not special, but TB is.
People die of malaria because we let them, they die of dysentery –
You own a disease? Well, I’m sorry I missed the IPO on dengue fever.
Right now, I’m just trying to save your life.
Can’t we just agree that you’re incredibly annoying? Take the pills or I let you die, do an autopsy, call my own press conference, and make sure the world knows that you didn’t die of TB. Corporate sponsors will be disappointed, but they’ll find another disease.
Because I’m just a mean son of a bitch. [House leaves, and Sebastian takes the pills.]
So we still have to explain P-R variability, syncope, headaches, and… low sugar?
This is good!
Bizarre is good! Common has hundreds of explanations. Bizarre has hardly any.
Uh-uh. I get to ask the questions. I’ve found you look a lot smarter asking the questions than dumbly not answering.
See how smart she looks? Cause she asked the question.
Which just leaves the tumour. [He leaves, they all follow.]
Small tumour. Really, really tiny. So small we can’t see it. Nesidioblastoma.
It responds to stress. Like if, oh, I don’t know, if someone accidentally puts the mechanical bull on11. [They pile into the elevator.] Easily removed by surgery.
“She asked, looking clever.”
How do you prove something exists when you can’t see it? Does God exist? Does the wind blow?
Look for effects. [They get out of the elevator, where Cuddy and Cecelia are moving toward them.]
Dr. House has an emergency.
Eventually she’ll die. You sure she doesn’t have breast cancer?
We think you have a tumour, easily removed surgically. We’re going to poke it with a stick.
Nothing happens. Splenic artery, it’s a hard left off the celiac. [Chase goes for the artery.]
What usually happens when you poke something with a stick? It pokes back.
I knew we should have stopped for directions. Men.
We’re going to inject calcium into your pancreas. The beta cells will release insulin. If there are too many beta cells because of a tumor, your blood sugar will drop precipitously.
Fingers and toes crossed.[to Chase] Go ahead. [Chase injects the calcium. CGI shot of it entering the artery.]
No leaves rustling. Blow harder.
Well, I guess now would be the time to give him more than 1 amp. [CGI of more calcium entering.]
Not yet.
Not fast enough. [Monitor beeps.]
Push an amp of D-50, you want to kill the guy? [CGI of the meds entering the system.]
Congratulations, you have a tumor.
Are you going to go out with him?
Nope.
Two days ago you were holding his hand. What’s changed?
On the other hand, maybe there’s too much of a future now. You weren’t attracted to him because he was prepared to die for a cause, you were attracted to him because he was actually doing it.
That was simple?
Everybody does it. We are who people think we are. People think he’s a great doctor so they give him stuff.
The reality is irrelevant. [House looks into the clinic and sees Cecelia sitting there.] I’ll prove it. People who know me see me as an ass, treat me as an ass. People who don’t know me see a cripple, treat me as a cripple. What kind of selfish jerk wouldn’t take advantage of that fact? [He enters the clinic, and walks by Cecelia, deliberately leaning his cane on her boot.]
Oh, my goodness, are you okay?
[exaggerated, toward Cuddy]I am so sorry. It was completely my fault.
Well, I’m very relieved, I feel terrible.
You sure? Okay. [They shake hands. Cuddy and House make faces at each other. As House leaves, Cuddy walks through her office door to Cecelia.]
It’s not about the kids dying every 8 seconds, it’s about the media stroking. Adulation and pats on the head.
Look at him, he loves it. Eats it up.
Listen, I saved his life. That means I get credit for every life he saves from here on out.
Good morning!
Really? That must be why I’m so hungry. Who’s up for lunch?
[poses] It keeps me warm, and cool. How does it know?
Must be a boring discussion, considering that I haven’t accepted a new patient.
Oh, wait, wait, when I said I’d do anything for the money, obviously I didn’t mean it.
Thank you for saving me the trouble of deflecting that personal question with a joke. [Chase smiles, and House turns to Wilson] College student? Nitrous oxide is fun at parties. ’Cause the shocks and drinking 'til you puke every night can cause everything else. Give him some B12.
[sighs] Cervical spondylosis?
He’s black, I’m assuming he’s not just really dirty, but is of African descent. Which means he’d have a lower white count.
He’s a wrestler, probably uses diuretics to cut weight, can also cause low white count.
[Mockingly] Not this low. Tieshets(??).
Something’s missing. Find out what it is. [Tosses the chart on the table in front of the ducklings.]
Well figure it out, find it out, and then find me, I’ll be at lunch.
Invite me to dinner Thursday night. [Wilson looks blankly at him] Come on we haven’t had a nice meal together since, oh…
[tosses his cane up in the air and catches it near the top, then hands it over to Wilson] My treat. [House limps over to the bike]
Actually two-wheeled vehicles that go 180 miles an hour do not go well with healthy responsible architects who don’t know how to separate breaking and turning. [While he is saying this, House is lifting his right leg over the bike, and settling down onto the seat.] Good news is, it brings the price right down.
Thank you. See that’s how you do it, compliments, dinner.
If he buys me dinner, he’ll find out. [House takes his cane back from Wilson and twirls it, then clicks it into place on the side of the bike. A special holder is there for that purpose.] Evel Knievel had the same setup.
I don’t want hand-me-downs. I want brand new stuff.
Sorry I didn’t catch that last part!
You checked the police report?
On his mom's car accident.
She veered off a straight dry road in broad daylight. That doesn't seem odd to you?
That's what the police thought. Of course, they didn't know that she has a family member who is frequently incapacitated by shock-like sensations
It's interesting. Type 2 neurofibromatosis could cause the shocks.
[shrugs] I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22
You'd rather have dinner with your wife?
[smiles] Unlike her, I could make it worth your while [leers]
Should I drive?
He lied to his son about how his mom died? [takes a Vicodin]
Manipulating him.
They lie to us because they love us. Who's getting teary?
SO, what exactly are we talking about here? A little peeker, or did the prairie dog actually come out to play?
Are we talking explosive?
Good, now we're getting somewhere [checks the caller ID]
I have no idea [picks up the phone] Hello?
Hi mom! Look, err, I have a business dinner on Thursday night, I can't get out of it. I know, I really I wanted to see you too. Uhh, actually, can I call you back? I'm in a meeting right now. Okay, thanks. [The ducklings look confused and startled, House puts down the phone]
Angelina Jolie. I call her mom. Who thinks that's sexy? [turns back to the whiteboard] So, explosive or gushing...
Great, yeah. My dad's taking her to Europe, they got a nine-hour layover in Newark on Thursday. If it's gastrointestinal...
Are you kidding? I can't lie to my mom. [Cameron's look clearly says that's obviously bullshit] Seriously, I can't! Wilson's invited me to dinner. It'd be rude to stand up a guy who just loaned me 5 grand. [Cameron looks shocked]
Thank you for taking no interest in my mother. But that begs the question, what caused the transverse myelitis?
Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin level and an electrophoresis
[talking to the symptoms on the whiteboard] You're good my friend, I'm sure we'll meet again.
Are these people completely incapable of telling the truth to each other?
[sighs] No wonder he lied. Children aren't supposed to have good times.
Where have you been?
The boys have uncovered the shocking fact that the patient has a crappy relationship with his dad.
Well I don't. There's only one reason any kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.
He say that to you or his pops?
[thoughtful] Spring break was over a month ago, even pot would have washed out by now
True. But the stuff they put on it does.
Or he could have smoked it. A lot of it. And then lied about it because that's what this family does. Start him on IV of pralidoxime. 2 grams per litre and then 1 gram every eight hours until you see some improvement.
Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.
Cameron, who were you making dinner plans with?
You bastard! [Wilson turns around and sees House] You invited my parents to dinner.
Hah! Not as big as yours!
Well what do you care?
You could have just asked.
And you would have believed me! Which would have kept us both happy. [Wilson looks utterly confused] You want your money back? Is this what this is about?
I didn't. [takes out his chequebook and starts writing a cheque] Just wanted to see if you could give it to me. I've been borrowing increasing amounts ever since you lent me 40 dollars a year ago. A little experiment to see where you draw the line.
Hey, it's 5 grand. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. [tears the cheque out of his chequebook] So what do you say? One little phone call and one big cheque?
[shocked] What do you mean? You just said that--
He's healthy, so all is forgiven. Now I'm feeling nauseous.
The shocks have also decreased
And he's out of the diaper, which is good news for everyone.
The little buggers need time to grow. Don't worry, our wrestling Rastafarian will be back on his feet and sneaking around behind pap's back again in no time. [the phone in his office starts ringing, House picks it up] Yeah. [pause] Check it again. I'll be right there. [puts down the phone]
Apparently I can save money by switching to another long-distance carrier.
Oh yeah, it's always about you isn't it?
You want the truth? Or you want me to make something up to protect you? We think a drunk driver broke into his room.
The truth is... I have no idea.
There's the fever that Cameron was looking for
Yeah, except in this universe, effect follows cause. I've complained about it, but--
No, the tests were right. Yesterday he had no fever, no infection.
Yeah. Because his white blood cell count was down he was vulnerable, because it's really down it might kill him. That's ALL this is. Is he still pooping his pants?
Again?
He was feeling better, he was never getting better.
That would be the ideal. You [points to Chase] intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics. You [points to Foreman] get a cervical thoracic and lumbar T2-weighted fast spin echo MRIs, and you [points to Cameron] track down all those Richie Riches who went to Jamaica. See if any of them have got the shocks, the trots or the hots. Hots is the... fever
To apologise. [Cuddy smiles, not trusting House one bit] I realise that my attention to the clinic has been somewhat lax of late and I want to make amends. How about tomorrow night, I take the night shift?
Yeah but I'm sure there's plenty of things to be done, there's charts to be reviewed, supplies inventoried--
You're going too?
Give me a reason to get out of this, and I'll tell you who started the rumour about you being a transsexual.
There will be, unless you get me out of this dinner.
You lie to your mother?
My mom's a human polygraph. My dad should be taking her to Vegas, not the Louvre.
I don't hate her. I hate him.
What did it look like? Aside from not ringworm.
Get him in here, we all want to take a look.
What are the odds of two friends who've just returned from a trip outside the country coming down with unexplained, but unrelated illnesses? Get him in here.
Tell him his friend's life hangs in the balance.
Tell him his life hangs in the balance. Tell him the rash is flesh-eating and the next course in the menu is his frank and beans.
Double the dose. And add tygacil to the list.
Where's Richie Rich?
Yeah, you told me that two hours ago.
Why, 'cause it's wrong? Or because you're a coward?
You've been wasting 2 hours of the kid's time. Is that deeply and unforgivably morally wrong? No. Because it's not a waste of his time. Unless we're wrong, unless his condition has got nothing to do with his friend's. You're just afraid of being wrong.
You Taddy?
Love the name. If I ever have a dog... take off his pants.
Don't talk to her, listen to me
You wanted to be a doctor, maybe you should have buckled down a little more in high school [takes a pair of scissors and starts cutting up Taddy's pants]
Exactly how close were you and Carnell?
Spend a lot of time together in Jamaica? Share a room?
Not saying you're gay, I'm saying you had sex. [tears the pants open and starts inspecting the rash near Taddy's groin. Fortunately, Taddy's still got his briefs on]
Right, so you just flew him down to Jamaica because he won a contest.
It's not fungus.
There's no pustules, it's not Staph... [suddenly looks up at Taddy] His dad's what?
You lied.
Oh, yeah, problems with this family, probably need more specifics. You told us you owned a construction company, not a salvage yard.
Right. That's why I'm mad. 'Cause we wasted all that filet mignon on you. Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you?
Braided wire, metal weights, lead canister, maybe just a lid. Probably used it as a door stop or paperweight.
Okay, here it comes
So he can lie about it later. Where's the keychain?
Kept it where?
Where are the kid's clothes?
[gestures at Chase and Foreman] You two get it to radiology.
The bureau. Don't open it. [they rush off, he turns to Cameron] You come with me.
Set it down there. Now get out of here, this thing is radioactive. [he takes a Geiger counter out of the small box and turns it on. Chase runs out]
Call the boys in the lead pyjamas. [Foreman runs out]
And caused tumours.
Do a PET scan. Check his cervical spine. It's not going to be good news.
Mom.
[gets up and hugs her] It's great to see you.
Actually, yeah. I uh... I have to take a rain check.
I asked him to cancel. I'm dealing with kind of a complicated case right now, so...
My team is busy.
Mom, don't make me feel guilty.
I've got a patient who's probably going to die of radiation poisoning.
Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Nope. Just gullible.
Not much.
It's always the answer.
Got a new motorcycle. Might have seen it out front, it's orange with a gigantic scrape.
Yeah. Looks like crap, but it drives great.
Actually, three [holds up his cane]
Shifting gears?
[turns to his mother] Well, good thing we got that cleared up
I don't need help.
[sprawled out on an arm chair and one leg on a foot rest] Thank you. For not eating. [He gives her a look that looks thankful but also uncomfortable with the situation]
[nods] They seem perfectly pleasant don't they? They are. He was a marine pilot. She was a housewife. Married 47 years. They had one child. Mom was just like everyone else, nice enough, no great sense of humour, hates confrontation. My dad's just like you. Not the caring 'til your eyes pop out part, just the insane moral compass that won't let you lie to anybody about anything. It's a great quality for boy scouts and police witnesses. Crappy quality for a dad.
Yeah!
Oh god. Are you pregnant? ‘Cause I really want to finish high school
They're good for two more months
You know; our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together. Why'd we stop doing that? Did you get married?
Rice isn’t r— Oh I get it!
I don't do dictations. Cameron does them, or somebody.
Joke killer
[sighs] Sorry, can't play anymore, my mom's calling me [walks out of his office]
You’ve got to fire Stacy
She's loading me up with pointless paperwork
She's hostile. You know me, hostility makes me shrink up like a... can't think of a non-sexual metaphor. She's going to stand over my desk with a ruler checking my spelling!
Professional athletes, Cuddy! It's like watching an old movie at 2am, re-living all the classic moments. Part where he denies it's drugs, part where the good guys ride in, tests a-blazing, prove that it IS drugs. Oscar clip, he can't imagine how that got into his body! So familiar, so comforting. [Points back at his office where Stacy still is] She can't handle working with me
Anyway, thanks for getting me out of that meeting. [Starts to walk away]
I'm a doctor, you're a sick person. [Looks at the manager] And you are a loved one
So what's the drug du jour on the bike circuit these days? Still erythropoietin? Or are you guys just chugging battery acid?
Damn! [Looks at Cuddy] Ten bucks for the tickets, six for the popcorn
That's a very daring confession
Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.
So, injecting yourself with donor red blood cells for fun and profit. Any other tricks up your sleeve?
So you go slower they see you longer. Let's say that our health could be affected by things we did before last Friday.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but why would you be sick?
This guy doesn't even get sick like a regular person. Instead of a list of symptoms and no cause, we have a list of possible causes for one symptom
Respiratory distress. And insanity doesn't cause it, I looked it up.
Not with a clean spiral chest CT
That'd cause pulmonary oedema which he doesn't have
Tox screen was normal. All the tests were normal. There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see.
Come to papa!
The air is keeping him from breathing air. Let's go with that for the irony. Get a VQ scan, check his veins for bubbles.
Now there were 3 wasted words.
I love when you do both sides of the conversation. It's like white noise, it's very peaceful.
Green for food, orange for beverages, red for impure thoughts. That bulb burns out every 2 weeks.
Pumped an air bubble into a vein in his lung.
Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?
I'm just trying to function. He's trying to win himself some little yellow jerseys. [The cafeteria door opens to admit Stacy wheeling Mark in on a wheelchair] Uh oh.
[rubs his forehead] Trouble in paradise, 2 o' clock
[points] there.
She was unbelievably pissy 3 hours ago
When she's angry, she gets sarcastic. When she's annoyed, she's funny, but when she's frustrated, she gets pissy
She's miserable with Mark because he's not me. So she's gotta make me not me, so she makes my professional life miserable, if I can't do my job--
Oh I get some "some" all the time, I always need to borrow "some" money
I've been pissy.
I've been busy. [Picks up Mark's fork and deliberately eats some of Mark's food off his plate] When you save someone's life, they owe you forever.
How's your recovery going? Gotten around to the small muscles yet?
[turns back to Wilson] How awkward was that? [Wilson gives him an annoyed but knowing look] What's he doing here anyway? He's got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.
Hey! Your [stutters a little in exaggerated excitement] you again!
What's there to say? It’s only the responsible thing. I'm sure he's got a lot to deal with
What makes a guy start drooling? Chase, were you wearing your short shorts?
Why?
Maybe the problem is not the embolus itself. Maybe it's the treatment. Maybe you hit a nerve, literally.
So what would be just right, Goldilocks? Full blood workup, including ANA for lupus. And get a muscle biopsy; find out if we're talking myopathy or neuropathy. I'm late for my session [gets up and walks out]
Not today. I've come for the healing. Dr Harper, as you know, I err, I have a bum leg. What you don't know is, I'm upset about it. I need to talk.
You've been telling me for years that I should come by. Here I am. [to the group] Hi guys
Poker night.
Book club. Well look, if it's a problem, I'll just go deal with my rage privately.
[nods thoughtfully] I'm tired of fighting.
Oh god, I know that feeling.
Yeah I know, but you're starting to walk. You're going to get better.
You have a wife, which gives greater meaning. Wife could make things harder too I suppose.
When it happened to me, Stacy was great. She kept telling me not to rush it. I never believed her.
I know, but... Stacy... She shouldn't have to wait, right? And you know she feels it too. Needs more time at work, needs more satisfaction from work. She didn't get married to be a nursemaid. She wants a man.
That's an interesting question. Maybe she was attracted to different things in the two of us.
But why was she with me to begin with?
Maybe it's that simple. Or maybe she saw something in me, something that she doesn't get from you.
Maybe she wanted an ass. She obviously did once.
You think that's the kind of thing you can just turn off?
Here's my new theory. The drooling is another competitive edge. Nobody can drive behind him, the road gets slick, he's the only one not racing in the rain!
[sighs] Paralysis?
So why is he normal?
He's shooting for extraordinary, so why is everything so ordinary? I mean this guy's breathing, drinking and injecting himself with everything he can find to amp up his body chemistry, and yet every test is normal. He's artificially raising his red blood count, so why isn't it raised?
Can't slip anything by you.
Yeah, but it's been over an hour since we poked the patient with something sharp so, get a lumbar puncture. And order broad spectrum antibiotics.
So glad we cured his respiratory arrest, freed him up to develop respiratory arrest.
What was my theory yesterday?
Why would you be so petty, Chase? He's down a court. Either he's losing blood because you nicked something, or he's just not producing blood in which case we're talking acute anaemia combined with a muscular disorder.
Either you screwed up, or he's got cancer.
You want a medical opinion supporting that decision?
Symptoms meaning [flips open the chart] diarrhoea. A lot of diarrhoea.
Well, if you're upset, my hiccups are gone.
Well you were the one who was all ‘Greg, you need to confront your feelings’.
I've been pissy.
Mark's looking for help because... what? He’s resentful? Overwhelmed? I'm asking because I care.
Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder.
How many packs? [Turns back to the patient]
Yeah. What was I thinking? I'm talking about the gum you're chewing; you ever play smoking as an oral fixation. How many packs?
You're pissy.
Pissy. You only get pissy when you're frustrated.
Ok, I'm wrong.
Right. The cripple boys. We should start a band.
And none of this has anything to do with me?
You're being poisoned.
Sugarless gum uses sorbitol as a sweetener. We use sorbitol as a laxative.
Congratulations, Chase. It's cancer. Clean him up and let Oncology have him, it's their party now.
Why would he lie?
People lie for thousands of reasons, but there's always a reason.
Unless he's not lying.
Wilson's chatty. Plus he's got two ex-wives to support. You want me to tell him he's fired?
How am I supposed to practice medicine with a lawyer sitting on my shoulder?
You know I can't do that!
He doesn't have cancer.
Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? [Lengthy pause] He's on EPO. [Rushes out]
Your anaemia is caused by pure red cell aplasia. This is going to hurt, but we got to talk.
He'll be fine. Sort of. I don't have time to watch him write out answers [he pulls out an oxygen mask and puts it over Jeff's nose and mouth] PRCA comes in two varieties, chronic and acute. Since it came on fast, you have the acute version.
That's the good news. Bad news is, pants are on fire. Acute PRCA is caused by drugs, most commonly, EPO. Ready, and... action! [he pulls the gas mask off]
[puts the gas mask back on] Ok, this time, more anger! Remember, this guy's accusing you of cheating. [Takes the gas mask off again]
Oh [kisses his fingertips] mwah, I believed it. It was simple, it was pure. Did you believe it? [Takes the gas mask off] I guess it's silly to cancel someone over the first audition. Why don't you do a reading?
Hmm...what do you think? That was a different way to go but, I don't know, I just didn't buy it. Does she handle any of your injections?
Gee, that's a great idea. I sure hope that EPO's not one of those drugs that's undetectable after six hours. Hey you know what we can test for? Phone calls. Take her cell phone, push the redial button, even money says it'll be connected to the newspaper that leaked your cancer story [Manager glares at him] Okay... [He reaches over to grab the phone at the foot of the bed but she grabs it first]
[scoffs at them by mimicking Jeff] Come on, give her a break. She's only doing what she has to to advance her career. Don't you have that tattooed on your tushie?
Who're you going to believe? Manager you've trusted for years? [Snorts] I've been to college
Can't leave if they don't exist.
The only problem with that theory is it's based on the assumption that the universe is a just place. If it were, then his poor manager wouldn't have been fired for no reason.
What's his red count now?
He needed a transfusion?
[makes a dramatic gesture with the stirring stick] Go forth and scan his neck.
Or repeat everything I say in question form.
She came into the clinic and yelled at me. Then she left. Then she came back and yelled some more.
I know what the yelling means, it's the coming and going I find interesting. It's not rational.
Some anger is. She could have pulled me aside, screamed at me privately. Her beef is simple and well-founded. She was out of control.
She's in my face, I need to know why.
Oh, why else?
I knew it wasn't in his chest. All we've done since he checked in is look at his chest.
There are two types of PRCA. Acute comes on suddenly, chronic takes its time. We all thought Jeff's was acute because it happened right in front of us. What if it had been there for months? Maybe years?
Which he was getting in convenient blood-doping form.
Up to half of patients with chronic PRCA have a thymoma. And up to half of patients with a thymoma… [takes out a syringe] I’ve always wanted to do this.
You are healed! Rise and walk.
In the Bible, you just say "Yes Lord" and then, start right in on the praising.
No, what did you Lord. Thymoma is a tumour in the thymus gland. He's a bit of a wimp, but he hangs with the tough guys. PRCA and an auto-immune disease called myasthenia gravis. MG causes muscle fatigue, including respiratory problems and difficulty swallowing.
Treatment for PRCA is blood transfusions, treatment for MG is hyperbaria. You were doing both as part of your regular freak show. When you took a break everything went to hell…which is not an uncommon reaction in Jersey.
[raises his hand to his lips] Ooops. No, no EPO. This has nothing to do with anything you did. You can let her know she's in the clear.
[makes a snarky face when Jeff isn't looking] You don't need your thymus. Take it out, everything else is manageable.
Nuh uh, this is just diagnostic. This just erases the symptoms of MG for five or six minutes [Jeff suddenly starts wheezing again and suddenly drops like a ton of bricks onto the floor. House stands there without raising a hair] Sometimes less. This is exactly why I created nurses. [Calls out from the room] Cleanup on aisle three!
I want to apologise [he solemnly sits down] Maybe I've been punishing you for a little too long. And maybe you've been punishing me. If we're going to work together, I need to know - do you hate me? Or do you love me? Either way, I think we've got a problem.
You don't hate him?
So what do we do?
Right. That plan's been working great so far.
Why?
Hey, I need you to open that door.
Yeah er... I was having therapy in here today, and er, I left my cane.
Dude! I'm crippled.
Got it, you're morally outraged. Now can we get through this part? 'Cause the next part's awesome. [He takes a bite of toast.]
Borrowed a key
Nope! I made copies. Mark is, and I quote [Wilson groans.] "Withdrawn, passive-aggressive, won't communicate, like he resents me because I can walk."
Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up. Meanwhile, she can't stop thinking about [Walks up to Wilson and shows him the notes.] I can't read that, is she obsessed with a Grey Horse? Or me?
It's a pet name. [Picks the notes back up.] Here's the kicker. [Shows the notes to Wilson again; Wilson reads it again with interest this time.]
Doctor cleared him, but no liftoff. She's frustrated so she's doc-blocking me. Paperwork, seminars, meddling with my patients
While looking for my newspaper, efficient huh?
[Sighs.] Dr Wilson, I want you to meet my stalker
I am not treating you.
[Turns around to give Wilson a look.] He is so self-loathing. [Grabs the newspaper from Kalvin.] Well, we've got to go now, so maybe see you after work--
[Doesn't bother to look at the file.] Well your shirt is gaping at the collar, means you lost weight, you're flushed, that's fever, and you're short of breath. And finally there's the KS lesion on your face; means you're HIV positive, you've progressed to full-blown AIDS. So you're sick because your immune system is shot and someone sneezed on you. [Shoves file back to Kalvin.] Can I be excused now?
Your concentration camp physique begs to differ. Get your T-cell count re-checked.
All of this will be fascinating to an HIV specialist. Now let go of my cane before it becomes your new boyfriend.
Congress says you can't, so...
I didn't touch him. [He’s intrigued.]
We gave him epi, he's fine.
Four words, two mistakes. He's not a patient, and I didn't hit him.
I didn't cause the anaphylaxis. It's probably one of his HIV meds abacavir.
Medically, this case is a snooze-fest. AIDS plus infection.
Just 'cause he says I hit him doesn't make it true. Watch, [Looks up at the ceiling.] I am surrounded by naked cheerleaders [Nothing happens.] See? [Stacy hands him a mug of coffee.] Although I like my chances of some action this morning.
You make me meet you at your house. Your husband is conveniently absent.
Well, I'm surprised your feet are touching the floor.
[Takes off his jacket.] What was Mark up to? Memory serves, quick climb up Mt. Gregory, and you dozed through a seal hunt. Clubbing, shrieking. [Walks to the sink and starts washing the dishes.]
Sorry, it's driving me nuts.
People change. I could make sure you’d sleep like a baby tonight.
I was referring to the rat.
It's not what you think. I know it looks like we're cleaning dishes, but actually we're having sex.
I give you Kalvin Ryan; so flamboyant in person, so boring on paper. Obviously got an opportunistic infection, probably TB or PCP.
I started, but I found the characters two-dimensional.
HIV clinic. So few patients, so much money; [Sorts his mail.] re-do the tests.
Fine, parasite.
What if his immune system is too strong?
His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep. It wakes up hungry, cranky, spoiling for a fight. When it doesn't find an active infection, starts attacking the harmless remnants of old infections. Immune reconstitution syndrome.
BORING! This is so not interesting. Chest X-ray and find the old infections, start him on steroids.
Now THAT would be interesting. Where's the coumadin?
It's for Stacy's rat; death by anti-coagulation. [He reaches for a bottle.]
I don't want her back. I just want her to admit her feelings for me. I go to Cuddy, Cuddy fires her or re-assigns her. Either way, I'm happy.
[Picks up the phone.] Hi, this is Mark Warner, 1724 Spring Street. Listen, you don't need to send that guy down, we caught him. No, you should send the bill to Princeton-Plainsboro hospital. Attn: Dr James Wilson, yeah. [Puts down the phone; Wilson nods thoughtfully and rather acceptingly but also seems to have been left speechless.]
Hopefully Mark's anger will go away eventually.
Didn't seem really wild about you, either.
He's angry. Said so in group.
[Smells a ball of cheese he brought wrapped in foil.] He's mad at you.
[Sighs.] No, but it's true. He resents you for being able to walk. Been there. I resented you for hell of a long time.
[Picks up the cell phone.] What!?
At your girlfriend's place. Ignore the moaning and squeaking.
He a smoker?
Not surprising. Not medically relevant.
That's a typical side-effect of AZT. What are Kalvin's most recent infections?
[Whispers into the phone.] Well let's assume it's one of those. Give him Ganciclovir for the CMV...
In a closet. Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up. Ganciclovir for the CMV, Sulfadiazine for the Toxo, Bactrim for PCP. Gotta go. It's killing time. [Puts down the phone.]
Very interesting.
The coughing part, not the in Cameron part. New symptom, blood vessel ruptured in his lung.
Well it takes immune reconstitution off the table. What's it put on the table? [Chase and Foreman are silent.] Its ok, she's not here. You can skip the nice guy acts.
My giving a damn or not is not going to change what happened.
No edema, no blood in urine.
Oh this is good, he's pretending to care, you're pretending not to.
Concerned enough about his health to stalk me while indulging in deadly street drugs. [Takes a vicodin.] Study in contradictions. Interesting. Still not medically relevant.
Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins [Ducklings start to walk out.] Foreman, you're with me.
I need a consult on another case.
It's a hip-pocket deal. Patient presents with a distinct neck tilt.
He's a regular runner.
None that he's complained of [They reach a vending machine, House gestures for Foreman to hand him some coins which Foreman does automatically.]
Uhh… I don't think so [Gets his drink from the vending machine.] No insurance.
Phew! For a moment there I thought you were smart. Cameron, get a biopsy of Calvin's lung tissue. Run a spectrographic analysis.
No reason to risk exposing the entire team. Then who would I torment?
Well I had to, Mark isn't here.
Oh really? How's he doing?
I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen ate any coumadin. I named your rat. [Stacy gives a look of disbelief.] Steve's tilting his head. Any neurologist will tell you that suggests an infection or brain stem tumor.
Well we can't kill him. If it's an infection, it could be caused by something in your house, something that could affect you guys [He scrapes something off the floor and goes to sit beside Stacy]. Smell this, [Stacy sniffs it.] does it smell like urine?
[Sniffs it.] You missing any asparagus? Ok, stuff these. [He hands her a bottle of antibiotics.] He doesn't get better, then it’s a tumor.
Steve McQueen without hair? [Shakes his head.] It's a blessing he died young. [They both smile.]
She's fine, probably getting bored with the question. Masses in the heart and lungs, what kind of cancer are we looking at?
So's an ear infection, but since he didn't test positive for that either…
[Splutters.] Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? [Cameron doesn't budge; House seems to like that idea a lot.] Do it.
So… how is the patient's father?
‘Tell my dad I'm sorry?’ Might as well wave the red flag at a bull.
Well it's not a tragedy, dad doesn't want to see him, he doesn't want to see the dad. You're the only one who wants them together.
He thought he was dying. Dying people lie too. Wish they'd work less, they'd been nicer, they'd opened orphanages for kittens. If you really want to do something, you do it; you don't save it for sound bite.
[Pregnant pause.] On the other hand, [Cameron sighs, not getting an answer as usual.] his dad tossed him out. So what's our guy want to apologize for?
'Course not! Also when he's at group therapy, or out for dinner with friends.
You tell your wife everything?
My bet is she mentions me to Mark as little as possible, 'cause she thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me. And you know why she thinks that?
If you're right, she did tell him, and I don't get through the door tonight. But if I'm right… [House gets into the elevator, the door closes.]
'Til something happens.
We are downwind, and he seems to have hearing loss.
Steve McQueen does not run from danger. Antibiotics on the other hand… [He picks a pill up from the floor.]
Admit it, you like him.
You wanna now how cool he is? His urine showed traces of hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead. He's a smoker. Your husband's been lighting up; which is particularly stupid, it could cause his AIP to…
I always knew.
You started two weeks after my surgery. Menthols, then lights after a month.
'Cause it helped me monitor your misery level. One trip outside was a good day, upwards of six you were in hell.
I already knew. Sorry you were miserable.
You're late… and hung over. [Looks carefully at Cameron.] Or maybe not.
Jealous?
Don't mind me. Just here for the show.
What happened to the big apology? Yesterday he was all ‘Daddy, I'm so sowwy.’
You should have thought of that before you stalked me. Now I'm interested. [To the dad.] So what's he got to apologize for? You're the one who tossed him out.
I don't know. 'Cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies that your son knows all the words of The Wiz.
42nd Street? Much easier to just get drunk and beat him. Explains his hating you; [Dad is facepalming.] also your cirrhosis. Also why the more I talk, the more you sweat. What it doesn't explain, is why he's gotta apologize to you. [To Kalvin.] Residual guilt for sharing your special toy with other boys?
Just want to leave the bigot with some peace of mind after you're gone?
He steal her signature look?
Yeah, that certainly is shocking.
Tragic tale. Undercut slightly by the rapid fire delivery and constant movement. Too much coffee this morning?
Brother's on the down-low got to
Working girls are sticklers. You're not going to poll Chase? [She looks at him sharply.]
Obviously not. Who doesn't sleep with a drugged out colleague when they have a chance? [He gives Cameron and Chase a pointed look that plainly speaks of levels of satisfaction for finding out; Foreman looks surprised, but grins.]
We got the result for the Kveim test. [Shakes his head slightly. Cameron sighs.]
Nyah, don't like to repeat myself. People will say I'm formulaic.
I can't do that, Steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smoke-free environment. Cigarettes aggravated his infection.
Steve's infection is not contagious to humans. I'm an idiot. How did I miss mycoplasmosis? Was that the kid's father?
What's he doing in the hallway? His kid getting his biopsy already?
Kid doesn't have parasites.
Was he still sweating?
Not the rat, the dad! [Wilson doesn't have an answer. House starts walking back towards the dad.] Where are they from?
You were right, it's a parasite. Cancel the biopsy. It’ll kill him. [Bangs his cane against the glass wall of the room the dad is in.] Hey daddy, come with me!
Your son asked to talk to you.
[Slides the door closed.] He wanted to talk to you.
Did you two use to hunt together? Foxes. Did you kill foxes?
[Walks towards Kalvin.] Those masses in your chest are not tumors. They're parasitic cysts from a bug called echinococcus. Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard, they can hunker down for decades -- growing, spawning, shopping, putting on plays.
Okay, it's cancer. You happy? The cysts isolate the parasites, keeping them from showing up in stool samples, even in blood tests, cardiac--
But you've got the same things in your liver.
Liver cysts have identical symptoms with one addition, fever. Now liver cysts we can test for. Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's. So, option A, we draw some blood--
You see, this is why I need you here. I want you to tell your son that you won't take a simple painless blood test to save his life.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it! You're really mad at him for killing himself and for destroying everything you love. I don't have time for this, are you going to apologize?
[To the dad.] Are you going to give me some blood?
Okay. Option B. Why did your wife kill herself? Did she hate you?
Either Suzanne wanted to die, or she was both fat AND stupid. Used a Twinkie instead of a gun. And girls with big appetites, well they just can't get enough - of anything!
Probably nibbled on every devil dog in the county!
Just in case I'm not making myself clear, I don't mean the delicious snack…
[Pats his jaw very calmly.] Thank you, means I can do this [Uses the head of his cane to whack the father exactly where his liver is situated.] We're going to need some epi in here, stat!
You said you didn't care. [House uses his cane to push the dad back against the wall by pushing it against his neck.] Notice how you can't breathe? [The father sounds like he's choking/wheezing/going into shock.] Now either that's the cane, or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about and you've gone into anaphylactic shock, exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friend's car. I'm just SO excited to find out which! [House takes his cane off and the father slips to the floor clutching at his middle section.] I'm gonna schedule surgery.
Two successful surgeries, two lives saved. I'm over my quota. Can I have next week off?
It was self defense.
You're right. I was asking for it. The low-cut blouse, the 'Do-Me' pumps.
Okay. [Gets up to leave.]
I like this T-shirt.
Yeah, sure. Why not? He hit me first.
I'm the doctor.
A little.
There's no way that Mark doesn't know; [Stacy turns around.] about the smoking.
Then he hasn't been near you in months.
Can't be easy.
Why would you lie about this?
I don't care if you're sleeping with him or not, but you're not, so…
You're lying.
I just know you.
You knew I had an angle the moment I poured soap onto a scrub brush. [Stacy walks back behind her desk.] You could have thrown me out, or ignored me, or found another exterminator. You didn't even tell Mark that I kept coming by. You LET this happen because you wanna be with me.
She's over-reacting.
So you're saying I'm not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either?
The file got me on the floor of her attic with her pouring out her soul. The only thing I did wrong was get caught. [He tosses the coin and it almost hits Wilson's face.]
He's too busy to service you until after work. I got a couple of minutes though. Feel free to say something like "What'll we do with the time left over?" Or you could just stew. That works as well. [He turns to Wilson.] She stews before she gets violent.
Uh huh, any legal rights I should know about?
Great. [To Wilson.] And you thought this was going to be awkward. [He signs the papers.]
Get a sed rate and serologies. [He keeps struggling as he can't get the lid open.] Child proof. How many kids are hopped up on vicodin?
Right, like I'd ever get it back. Chase. [He tosses the bottle to Chase.]
Or genital. [To Chase.] Go find them.
Or genital. Go find them.
Whoa, whoa Foreman… Chase can handle the pelvic.
Well what's the committee going to do to me? I haven't even met this patient.
Which is why this doesn't matter; she protects Chase, she protects me.
Chase loves me. And isn't Turkish.
[Is about to enter an exam room in the clinic.] You really think Stacy hates me that much?
Where's the ulcer?
Not anymore. It perforated.
Let me guess, no insurance, just heard about the free clinic. It's a good move. You don't want to skimp on the essentials like wristwatches, MP3 players…
From the doorway?
Cool. I love gossip. [He puts the ear pieces of his stethoscope into the patient's ears and lets the patient hear his own lungs.] Hear that crackling sound like crumpling up paper? Keep listening. Let me know if it changes.
Wow. Talk about efficient. I only need one answer - Chase didn't screw up.
Well I'm not a lawyer, but that seems like a sucky legal strategy.
If I thought he was a 'reasonable' doctor, I wouldn't have hired him.
Stacy.
If by ‘fine’, you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of every orifice then yeah, I believe you.
I'm guessing those are celebratory bells.
Show me the ulcer.
Sweep back, show me the whole stomach. [Chase sweeps the camera back.] Stop.
Not anymore. It perforated.
She was not fine 2 hours ago. She mentioned stomach pain?
You didn't do an exam.
Did you listen to her stomach? Check her vitals?
Yeah, why didn't she go to med school like you did?! Diarrhea! Blood in the stool! These are routine questions--
Mistakes are as serious as the results they cause! This woman could die because you were too lazy to ask one simple question!
And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.
Unless you convince Chase to roll on me.
Uhh… [Checks the patient's file.] Chuck. I'm going to break from the parable of the wicked doctor and tell a little story about a patient. Let's call him… Buck, who has low O2 stats and crackling lung sounds.
Buck has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. His lung tissue's turning to rock. There's no known cause, no treatment. He is slowly suffocating.
Lung transplant's about a half a million dollars, but this poor sucker's got no insurance. If he tried to sign up now, he'd be excluded, pre-existing condition. But let me confirm with my lawyer [He turns to Stacy who doesn't respond.]. She confirms. If only Buck hadn't been diagnosed with fibrosis before he got insurance. So... back to the exam.
Oh relax. He's got a cold, and soon, health insurance.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you and Buck were so close. [Walks out of the exam room.]
Right. It's got nothing to do with what I did to you.
[Takes some lollipops from the clinic counter and puts them in his pocket.] That's why you're following me. I read some notes--
I was wrong. Terribly, terribly, sorry.
He has great hair.
I'm gay. Oh, that's not what you meant. It does explain a lot though. No girlfriend, always with Wilson, obsession with sneakers...
Do you listen to what you're saying?
You know what's really killing her? Chase forgot to ask a standard question about stomach pain, so he missed the diagnosis, so she perforated, so she got sepsis, so her BP tanks, so she got blood clots, so she lost her liver. [Chase is facepalming and looking very dejected.] Livers are important, Cuddy; can't live without them, hence the name. And here's the big issue, Chase is a hospital employee, and Kayla is the sympathetic mother of those 2 jury-friendly moppets Caleb and Cody.
That is a medical reason! [Cuddy's confused.] The family wins this hospital in a lawsuit; they'll turn it into condos. And people will die waiting outside a condo for medical care.
Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma pre-op.
Well that's why I came to the best transplant surgeon in the hospital. She's dead without you.
[Sighs.] Thank you very much.
Was it the part where he warmly clasped my hands in thanks, was that too much?
The hospital lawyer asks me if I did something unethical. If I did, the last person I tell is the hospital lawyer, especially since she's gone all 'old testament' on me.
Oh. Ok then. One caveat, I've moved past threesomes. I'm now into foursomes. If someone backs out then you've still got a threesome. [Stacy's glaring at House at this point.] If two people back out, you're still having sex. You'd be amazed. Even if three people--
[He winks.] Actually, it is kinda cool.
5 grand. And that's just ante money. After the surgery, you get another 15. Though I warn you, that includes the tip.
[Shrugs.] It's tax free.
[Nods.] Great; [He pockets the envelope.] means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery, [He starts to walk away.] I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?
Last Christmas party, Nurse Cutler handed you one of those little hotdogs. And you didn't thank her. Well that only happens when you're very, very intimate. That and the fact that you've been practically dancing around with your zipper open, used condom stuck in your shoe. [He walks over to pick up a sweet in a bowl nonchalantly.] Your wife is apparently the only one who doesn't know.
Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly. [Ayersman looks defeated.] No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free? [Eats the sweet.]
Hmm. Oh, and for the record, you are the worst transplant surgeon in this hospital. But unfortunately, you're the only one who's currently cheating on his wife. [He walks out, passing by the figures of himself and Stacy watching the scene.]
She'd have been dead in 2 days if I hadn't made Ayersman do the surgery.
Tried to leave it out of the story I told you.
Apparently, someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife.
Doesn't seem fair, does it?
To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you? You're not mad because I broke into your psychiatrist's office.
Okay, it was a lousy thing to do, but if what I'd found was that everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it.
You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going. And for that I actually am sorry. It was stupid. [Stacy turns and leaves, House throws his head back and looks fairly heartbroken and dejected.]
Let me tell you a story about a patient; [He takes the earpieces out of her ears.] the patient we'll call, [He checks her file.] Fusan.
Please, Chase, you and this strep. Get a room already.
Umm... well that depends. Are you going to hit [Goes to stand next to Foreman and points at him.] Dr. House? [Foreman looks at House and House stops pointing with an innocent expression on his face.]
You know a lot about hepatitis.
You're flushed. You sick?
You're hiding the fact that you're sick. Now why would you do that? [He grabs Sam's right arm which has two tattoos on the forearm.]
Now either you specifically asked for a tattoo of a heart that's been left out in the sun too long, or that is a really bad home job. It's a very common way of getting Hep C, which you have. You've had it a long time.
[Sarcastic.] You paid someone off? That is TOTALLY unethical! Get an MRI for him and his sister right now.
No! No, no, no, God no! [Serious.] I think she got cancer from you.
You're surprised they're suing? You think people love Chase so much they're gonna just forgo--
Ooh! I've been sued by him.
I haven't lied about anything. Except for the parts that I admitted I was lying about. And I'm not the one being sued. I feel funny. [He walks around to stand beside Cuddy behind her desk.]
May I speak to my future former employee?
Great story.
I'm sure it is. But you lied to him. You want him to sue you.
I ordered black coffee this morning and got cream. Everybody screws up.
I've seen you hung-over. You weren't the day you blew his sister's diagnosis.
If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you.
You were depressed and distracted. I assumed you'd gotten a phone call from your stepmom.
Good news is, both your parents are dead now so… no reason to screw up this bad again.
There's this interconnected network of computers, or interweb where you can--
[Sighs.] When he visited he told me he only had two months left. When you screwed up I did the math.
He asked me not to.
[Softly.] Yeah Chase, it was all my fault. Look, you got a choice. You can either tell the truth, hospital settles, family gets some money, they get to keep their house. Or you can keep up this lie, family gets punitive damages, they buy a jet, they move to Park Avenue, and you have to find another career.
I'm going to keep my mouth shut. Legally, it's better for me if you go down in flames.
I don't know. I thought you were going to get him to sell me out.
Why not?
Yeah. And that's not going to change unless you leave this job. Or I do. So how do you deal with a coworker that you have feelings for - positive or negative. I don't want to end up like Chase, I don't want to get emotionally caught up and kill… you.
So what do we do?
Not of the patient, I met the brother. Never met her. You want me to go to a family reunion every time I take on a patient?
[To Cuddy.] Did you know this was coming?
[To Chase as he walks in.] Now you're fired!
Out of the way, cripple coming through.
Take your time, don’t worry that there’s only thirty seconds to post.
Ninth at Gulf Street and Park; five hundred on the 3 horse, Seminole Uprising to win.
I’ll burn my winnings. Bigger flame.
Well, fat ass over there just saved you money.
I don’t bet on the horses, I bet on the jocks. My rider’s bulimic; purges after his weigh-ins; leaves a two pound pile at the starting gate, shaves valuable time off that final eighth.
Is anybody here a doctor? [Anica is seizing, and one man straddles her and prepares to start CPR.] You trying to cop a feel?
That would be useful if she was having a heart attack instead of a seizure.
If you want to get a finger bitten off. Call an ambulance.
Just make the call. [House sees something interesting, and pulls up Anica’s shirt slightly to see very discolored stretch marks/bruises.]
How should I know? Tell the paramedics to take her to Princeton-Plainsboro. The doctor’s name is House.
It does when I win. [He throws a chart on the table.] Hot OTB babe, has grand mal and inexplicable bruising. What up with that?
Spend as much time around the real people as I do, someone gets sick.
No fever, no infection.
Except for the fact that the bruises are not petechial, which means it’s not DIC.
What’s that called when you judge someone before ever meeting them?
I was there. I have a 9-to-3 job.
Good. Start with those.
Cushing’s. Explains the seizure and the bruising.
So she doesn’t eat a lot of meat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you just, ever so subtly, order me to get her medical history?
It was a pretend “in charge”, formality to get past the suits in Legal.
You can have it. You’ll also need my handicap placard. Bend over.
Chase killed that woman, now Foreman’s in charge?
Skip it.
[Looking at races.] Will I like Teeny Tiny Moe in the fifth?
It does not ask that. [It does, and he puts the form aside.]
What’s your excuse?
Yeah? What else turns you on? Drugs? Casual sex? Rough sex? Casual rough sex? I’m a doctor, I need to know.
Came here without a job. That means you didn’t move here, you moved away from somewhere else. [He pokes at the marks on her torso.] Does that hurt?
Are you on prescription meds? Hormones? Prednisone?
Well yeah, and I could reach down and get it, but that would kinda spoil the whole “cool move.”
You vegetarian?
Because you might have something called Cushing’s syndrome, which basically means that –
What a coincidence. I’m a doctor, too.
Huh? What did you just say? “You were right, House, her pituitary tumor regrew, it is Cushing’s, uncanny how you do that….”
Nope, Cameron had three ideas. I chose one to encourage, to nurture –
You need a hug?
“Work smart, not hard,” that’s my philosophy, boss.
Okay, so it’s a micro-adenoma, too small to see.
Right, it’s just a coincidence that I predicted a rare condition that she happened to have a year ago.
Didn’t do an LP. Knew what she had. [Foreman stops the test.]
Okay, I need you to roll over on your side, kiss your kneecaps.
She’s here to make sure I don’t paralyze you.
Successfully?
I’m gonna numb the area with some lidocaine, and then we’re off to the races! See what I did there? I used horse racing jargon to make the patient feel more comfortable. Okay, here we go. [He inserts the needle, Anica starts and gasps.]
Felt like bone. Does that hurt?
You’re perfect just the way you are. Oops, that was all me.
This is actually much harder than I remember.
Eighth time’s the charm. [Anica cries out again.]
Just let – [Alarm beeps.]
Turn that thing off, will you?
Okay. [To nurse.] It’s a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she’ll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office.
At the risk of sounding redundant, and right, again, she has Cushing’s. Cushing’s.
Actually, it has everything to do with it. Cushing’s plus stress equals hypertensive crisis. Smart move, sending the rookie.
The exact same moment that I’m futilely trying to give her an LP?
Why didn’t they put you in charge instead of Foreman? Oh yeah, you’re the guy that killed that woman. Get a pan-man scan before she dies of cortisol OD. [He makes a begging, pleading face to Foreman.]
I was in a crazy mood. Good thing I got a new boss to back me up. Although I think one of those is actually necessary. Better comb through before you cancel them all. [Foreman turns off the TV.]
Actually, I expect you to act like what you are, my employee, my subordinate, my bitch.
My God, I can’t believe I got more than a year behind on my discharge summaries. Gotta get caught up. Oh no, wait! I’m not authorized to sign these anymore! Only you are.
On the bright side, it still means I was right.
Good afternoon. I’m going to be looking at your – Perfect. Excuse me. [Picks up phone.] Need Dr. Foreman in Exam Room 1 for a consult. So when did this start?
You have an infection. Gonna need a sample.
No, I meant a sample of your – [He looks up to see her holding a bottle of strawberry jelly. [Oh boy.] Okay, we have a neurological problem here.
Oh yeah. You can cover yourself up, got what I need. [Foreman enters.]
Smell this. [He waves the swab in Foreman’s face.] Smells like vaginosis, but it’s not really my call.
Okay, I’m gonna give you some antibiotics, and you probably shouldn’t have sex for awhile.
On an evolutionary basis, I’d recommend forever.
The labs you sent yesterday put her ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter. She’s got Cushing’s, something set it off. It’s gotta be in her brain, set her up for a venous sampling. [Chase starts to leave.]
How’d you get him trained so fast? Electronic collar? Got treats in your pocket?
Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you.
She’s had brain surgery. You can fake a stomach ache; you can’t fake a brain tumor.
Venous sampling’s easier.
Not if you get caught breaking in.
Would you shut up if I told you she wanted someone black?
Nonexistent. Otherwise, excellent.
The world will never know. [He goes to his motorbike and turns it on.]
Yesterday, streets are clear. [He throws her a helmet.]
There’s construction on Elm. Bike will be faster. [Cameron puts on the helmet and gets on behind House.]
Well, either she’s very smart or she has a severe fiber deficiency.
Or, just thinking outside the box, here, she has a vagina, and trouble reading. There’s three pairs of reading glasses, each with different prescriptions, which would be explained by a tumor pressing on the optic nerve.
And you are looking for… A person with Munchausen’s syndrome drinks battery acid; they don’t go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.
How many hospitals have you contacted? Has one doctor said she’s crazy? It’s not Munchausen’s!
If you think she’s got Munchausen’s then obviously you’ve got something to show the man! A syringe in her apartment, a bottle of ACTH.
Oh, right, so the fact that we found nothing proves that there’s something.
Of course! We’re both right! Excellent solution. Everybody’s happy. Come on, step up, Foreman. If you think I’m right, order me and stick a needle in her brain, and if you think Cameron’s right, send the patient home. Either she’ll be fine or she’ll die.
Nice move, boss. Way to cover your ass.
Not because you think I’m right. You’re just taking the safe route. You’re a wuss. Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me. [He starts to leave.] Hey Wilson, guess what Foreman just did!
What did Mommy say; I don’t get any candy in my stocking?
Correcting your last note. We can’t discharge her, she’s sick. Anybody ever tell you, you write like a girl?
Correct, but not complete.
At the end of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” the wolf really does come, and he eats the sheep, and the boy, and his parents.
It does when I tell it.
Look, I checked her records. All her hospitalizations were for different things. Brain tumor, fainting spells, skin rashes, seizures… she’s had every blood test known to man and the results are all over the map. There’s only one constant, low HCT. The anemia’s real.
True. Could just be her MO. She self-induces two illnesses, one always changes, one never does. Or maybe she has Munchausen’s and aplastic anemia, which would mean without proper treatment she’d continue to get sicker, weaker; eventually she’ll start bleeding internally and die.
She will!
So far. We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.
Look, you kick her to the curb with a Munchausen’s diagnosis; you’re guaranteeing that no doctor will ever listen to her again.
What if she doesn’t know we’re testing her?
There’s probably some blood left over from previous tests.
Yes, I know. That’s why I want to do a bone marrow biopsy. But blood tests could show a systemic disease, viral or a toxin cause.
And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It’s the safe way to go.
I need all of these tests and a PCR done on this sample.
Patient’s empty.
You can try.
You may not have Salma’s ass, but she doesn’t have your eyes.
“See him walking down that street, so I ask you very confidentially, ain’t he sweet?” Epstein-Barr titers are through the roof, most common viral cause of aplastic anemia. So what I’m saying is, “Just cast an eye in his direction, oh me oh my, ain’t that perfection –“
Eh, just a wee bit. Could indicate –
Not all sickle-cell patients are black.
Of course it is! Metaphorically. Look, I couldn’t do the tests. I tried, there wasn’t enough blood left over. If you just let me do the biopsy…
And if it wasn’t for me, you would have been fired.
I don’t care what anybody says, I care what they do. Right now, Blackpoleon Blackaparte has got the nurses on red alert, I can’t get into the patient’s room. So come on, I’ll draw the enemy fire, you outflank them, get in there, get the bone marrow sample.
Who are you more afraid of?
All the tests have not been done. You do realize that Blackaparte’s reign is only temporary.
Crap is a relative term.
You used her real name?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait up! It’s all right, she’s going to stay.
Oh, bite me.
How’d you like another medical test?
Sit.
So you don’t crack your skull when you pass out. Just do it. You know what colchicine is?
Well, don’t feel bad. It’s for gout. It’s got nothing to do with anything you’ve ever pretended to have.
Shut up. Colchicine decimates your white blood cells, leaves almost no trace. Great for faking your way into hospitals.
Shut up. You’ve been doing this for years. Don’t worry, it’s probably not your fault. When you were a kid, you had a close relative with a chronic disease, probably sister. And you saw all the attention she got while you were left alone, ignored, and it really, seriously screwed you up.
Shut up! I’m trying to give you what you want, and save your life. You have aplastic anemia.
It means you’re not just sick in the head. The problem is, the rest of you appears well, so I’ve got to make you seem as sick as you’re supposed to be by injecting you with a drug that simulates the symptoms that you actually have. All you need to know is, you’ve hit the Munchausen’s jackpot. I’m going to give you a cocktail of insulin for seizure, and colchicine to kill your white blood count. This will absolutely confirm my diagnosis of aplastic anemia. There is one small catch. If you’ve actually done something to yourself to cause the anemia, then I’m wrong, and if I do what I plan to do, then the treatment will kill you instead of saving you. So I need to know, have you been taking anything besides the insulin, the ACTH, and the pills Cameron left in your room?
Good. Give me your arm. [House sticks her with the needle.]
Boo hoo.
Well, I obviously can’t be around when it happens.
Relax. You know the drill. People walk by here all the time, you’ll be fine. [House walks back inside as Anica collapses and starts to seize.]
Sorry, I missed that. My hearing’s been off since the Ricky Martin concert, some chulo kicked me in the head.
Say what?
Labs schmabs. A good diagnostician reads between the labs.
Hey, hey, hey, we’re not here to play the blame game. These things happen. Sometimes doctors send people out on the street to die after other doctors warned them that they were sending them out on the street to die. There’s no way you could know.
Turn it off.
How long has she been in there?
She doesn’t have aplastic anemia. She has an infection.
The body does crazy things.
Because her self-inflicted Cushing’s suppressed her immune system, stopped her from having a fever, hid the infection. Clostridium perfringens could cause the bruising, the schistocytes, the anemia…
Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system, why don’t we try that?
There’s lots of explanations for low white count.
Colchicine. I figured that she got her hands on it and just, uh, self-medicated.
People do crazy things.
She consented.
She smells oh, so sweet.
She would have gotten sicker when I said she was gonna get sicker except Cameron dosed her with antibiotics. Just hold this.
Hold my finger. [He cuts one of her bruises and smells it.] Grapey. You have a bacterium. It’s on all of us, but the bruises you gave yourself with the Cushing’s made it a lovely home. [It’s CGI time!] Bacteria moved in, parked their cars on the lawn, there goes the neighborhood. And by neighborhood, I mean your internal organs. So, should we put her on the Augmentin, boss, or do you think she infected herself with grapes? I love the smell of pus in the morning. Smells like… victory.
Kinda digging this whole “Foreman in charge” thing. Frees me up to watch my soaps, catch a movie in the afternoon, have lunch with you…
Now Cuddy’s on Foreman’s ass, not mine. [They walk out of the hospital together.]
Why not? People could change, you know?
Last race at Belmont, put it all on the five. To win.
We've been over this.
That makes no sense at all.
All of these?
She had a heart condition.
She also had low blood pressure, so nitro would be dangerous. Little blue pills improve blood flow, they’re vasodilators. That's why you sometimes get the headaches.
Well of course I do. The woman has a heart condition and she’s on her own. A man can't nail his office assistant, its national crisis time.
Fine, I'll pay for it. [He reaches for his wallet.] How much are the pills? She took how many?
No! I could. There's an ATM in the lobby.
Absolutely! [He is pathetically insincere.]
You do background checks on Medicaid personnel?
Yeah, time's good for me too; got a reservation at a little place in the inner harbor.
Best Maryland crab in... Maryland.
Not for hours.
You did a background check on me?
You checked on my flight, so you could be sure to be on a different one. Thought we were past the avoidance stage.
Where's your crucifix?
Riiight.
Hey honey, how are the kids? They miss me?
What's new with Mr. Aphasia?
Everybody covers their ass.
I'm betting there's another shoe.
I know the way you tell stories.
So it's not the drugs. He's just got such a bad rep. [Ball bounces on the back of the chair again; House turns around and glares at the kid AGAIN.]
Ok, I gotta hang up. They're probably trying to reach me.
I'm hanging up on you now.
How high a fever? [Foreman raises his eyebrows in surprise.] Put me on speakerphone. And why haven't you called me?
What, you think you guys could have a party as soon as the parents are gone and I won't hear about it? [Chase and Cameron get up from their seats to surround the speakerphone.] Start with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible bacterial meningitis, and an anti-viral in case we luck out and its herpes encephalitis.
Well then we're screwed. Which is why we need more information. [The kid from before is scrambling under House’s chair trying to look for his ball.] Any genetic issue with the family?
MRI show anything?
CT... that's like, short for MRI, right? Excellent, well I guess that saves us a lot of time.
I teach you to lie, and cheat, and steal, and as soon as my back is turned you wait in line? [the kid has gone back to his seat and House takes out the kid's ball from his jacket pocket] Get an MRI, and get a better medical history.
Who cares? He's probably going to lie anyway. My flight’s a little late; we'll be back in a few hours.
Got you some coffee. [He takes out another cup for himself and throws the bag away. He proceeds to fidget and tap his fingers on the coffee cup.] So... what do you want to talk about?
When people give themselves away, it's by little things. That woman over there, she's not sneering at her coffee, she’s recovering from Bell's palsy. And the cashier at the coffee place, she doesn't want anybody to know she's dying of ALS. There's a particular sort of twitchy stiff arm that’s characteristic. [Pause.] And then there's you. Why aren't you wearing your cross?
You keep jewelery cleaner under the sink so you won’t have to go a day without it. True, you forgot it that morning that our pipes burst, but then you went back and waded through the flood to retrieve it. Soo... why no wading today?
[Reading a book entitled "LESBIAN PRISON STORIES". ;)] Either you left it behind on purpose, or by mistake. The only reason you'd leave it behind intentionally, is if it no longer meant anything to you. [Stacy gives him a long-suffering look] But since it was a gift from your mom, that would mean you had a fight with her. But since you don't talk to ghosts, that’s unlikely.
Yeah, I'm good at that. So that leaves forgetting it unintentionally, but then we'd have to explain why you didn’t go back for it when you realized.
Nope, you were in make-up when you got to the airport. Can't put on make-up without looking at yourself and you can’t look at yourself without touching that thing.
It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.
I suppose it's also possible that the clasp broke, but then you'd be carrying the thing around in your purse.
[Immediately contrite.] So you had a fight, I'm sure it’ll blow over.
Of course it was. Mark's tired, he's worried, he's got mobility problems. It's normal that he'd blow up over little things.
You fought over mail delivery? [He winces.]
You were.
Maybe you're misinterpreting.
[He rolls his eyes.] Yeah, it's all your fault. You know Stacy in the original Greek means relationship killer.
House.
They recharge? I just keep buying new phones.
What's his creatinine?
You have to do it just right.
Either you've decided to do a lumbar puncture, or you have to fire me so that I can't fire all of you as soon as I get back in charge. Is Cuddy there ranting?
They can handle it.
Ok, they can't. Doesn't matter, guy's not stable enough to move. So go rant in your own office.
The odds are this guy knows something we don't.
Have you had any indication that he's tried to communicate something important?
That's cause you guys haven't scared him enough. I'm sure you’ve been all "oh we'll take read good care of you", why should he say anything? When you prep him, tell him he's going to die. Crush all hope. Don't let Cameron do it. Cuddy, you got a problem with any of that?
Want me to run down and reserve you a cot with view?
Checked it through.
Thanks. [He looks shocked and stunned into quietness.]
Right.
Does Mark know about this?
[He closes the door.] I have to know what's going on here, cause when you have a fight with Mark, and you try to avoid me, I have to think that--
Right. But then a hotel room...
Hmm. So... which is it?
Really good drugs?
Ok, sure...
I know what it is! Didn't think it was addictive.
[He puts his hand under her chin and raises her face up so he can see her face.]
I know [He smiles and dumps his cane on the bed as he moves in closer to put his hands on her waist and then leans in kiss her on the lips. After several kisses, he moves back.] If you hadn’t just had a fight with Mark...
House.
How did the LP go? Give me the reader's digest condensed version.
From infinity, yeah.
Ok! Well, call me back when you have something. [He takes the phone away from his ear, probably about to put it down even as Stacy leans in for another kiss, when Cameron’s voice cuts through.]
[He hesitates, then reluctantly puts the phone back against his ear.] What did he say?
Sympathetic presence after a traumatic moment. [He steps away from Stacy reluctantly.] Classic interrogation technique. What did he say?
Act the way you always do? Yeah, I did. What did he say?
A fluent aphasic retrieves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants. They can be filed by sounds or by meaning. So if he wants to say table, he could say... label, or he could say chair. Or he could just say Jabberwocky, there's no way to tell.
Hold on. [He puts the phone against his chest; Stacy sits up on the bed.] Uhh... I'm going to take this phone downstairs, so I don't disturb you. Is that ok? [He takes his cane from her.]
[Into the phone.] Keep him talking. Write down everything he says. [As he opens the door of the room, he looks back at her.] Stacy, that new make-up you bought, do you mind if I borrow it?
Crimson desire shows up well on sheet rock.
Well you must have gotten one new phrase out of him, something?
Are you sure you told me everything you found in his home and office?
[Surprised.] Hope that's not the end of the thought. [He unplugs the charger so he can pace further afield.]
That's cynical!
No, I'm just kvelling. [He exaggerates in a voice filled with tears.] Our little girl is growing up! Ok, what's the best way to rip a woman from the side of her dying husband?
I'll take a later one.
Are we in?
Hi, I'm Gregory House; I'm your attending physician, your wife's not there, start talking.
Ok, shut up now. Nice work, Cameron. Give him the list again.
Come on Chase, drugs didn't do this to him. Even if he is an addict.
Oh please. Mr. sleeping pills, amphetamines, bring me up, bring me down.
Ever hear this one? Build a house, each wall has a southern exposure, big bear comes wandering by, what colour’s the bear?
Polar. Whatever your name is, patient! Are you bipolar?
What's that? I can't see, is he nodding?
Topamax isn't just off-labeled for weight loss. It's off-labeled for mood disorders. Plenty of bipolars are manic in the daytime, depressive at night. He's been medicating for years with alcohol and sleeping through the bad hours. It explains the danger journalism, explains everything including the kitchen sink. Ok, technically it's kitchen cabinets. He starts a project, then he stops.
And it doesn't shut down your kidneys, but what it does do--
I'm on the phone— I’m on the phone—
Look, I'm a Doctor, and this is an emergency call.
I'm not going anywhere.
I kick, and I bite.
Being bipolar makes you take risks, you seek excitement. You make up stories.
Fine, maybe your stories are legit. People would start to wonder. Annoyed politicians, entire governments would be on your ass. You couldn't tell anybody you were bipolar, which was fine. Until you fell in love. [He turns to look at Stacy.] And you wanted that life. And you hear that there's a surgical cure, give the woman you love the life she wants. All you have to do is change. Bilateral cingulotomy, an experimental surgery that some people claim helps mood disorders.
It's not the surgery, it's the secrecy! What causes recurring fever? [Stacy is now seated on one of the airport chairs listening in on what House is saying.] Neurological problems, lethargies that you fight with caffeine pills and amphetamines. [The door to Fletcher's room opens, Elizabeth and Cuddy walk in. The Ducklings and Fletcher panic, House on the other end of the phone line is oblivious.] It wasn't your secret psych disorder; it was your secret daily drug use. It was the secret trip, and your secret surgery in Caracas or Buenos Aires, which by the way didn't work given the state of your kitchen cabinets.
What's going on?
Get some blood on a slide. Do not put it through a computer this time.
I'm counting on you to get me off the no-fly list.
Physically, his chances are good.
Two people who weren't meant to be together. Maybe they’ll get a happy ending just because they both want it so much.
He loved her enough to convince himself he could change.
--we need the curry".
Morning, Jimmy. Anybody die while I was gone?
Thought about shaving; couldn't find a razor.
Sorry, chief. I never kiss and tell. [They get into elevator.]
Did you iron *your* shirt? Everybody's flash today.
Not sure. Cameron keeps my calendar.
Didn't have a lot of time for talking. [Blatant wink.] If you know what I mean.
Gosh, wish I could. [To Cameron.] How did the HIV test go? Did you study up?
Movement disorder? Fascinating.
No. But maybe you will.
What does the flailing look like?
Demonstration?
Ooo, snarky. Was he like this the whole time I was gone?
It's a great idea, if you want to kill her baby. [He writes "Pregnancy" on board.] Movement disorder can present in the first trimester.
Peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate. Get a real pregnancy test. You know, the one with the blood and the hormones and the rabbit. [Foreman looks put off.] Oh, I'm sorry. It's still your limo. Whaddya say, Miss Daisy?
Lame duck's done quacking.
Okay. Get an MRI. See if it's in her head, or in her uterus. [They start to go.] You're gonna want to paralyze her. [They pause, stare at him.] You run tests on a flailer, somebody's gonna lose an eye.
Symptomatic of… lunch with Cuddy?
Then what do you need me for? Start her on Huntington's meds.
If we wait, she could progress to full blown psychosis. Then her kid will never get the chance to say goodbye. [To Chase.] Wanna tell the class how that feels?
She went from 0 to 60 in world-record time. [Foreman's beeper goes off.]
Yeah. That'd certainly make your job easier. Well good news for Margo, it's not Huntington's. Bad news for us, the psychotic break eliminates fertility meds; which means we have no idea what's wrong with her. [Sighs impatiently and shakes hands at the white board.] We give you so much, and you give so little!
So she raises a daughter, runs a business, she does charity work, she volunteers at school, attends PTA. What makes mommy run?
Cocaine. [All but Chase roll eyes.] Explains the psychosis and the flailing, and the uncanny ability to bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and never ever let Teddy forget that he's a man.
Take Foreman. There's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.
The door was locked.
Paranoia; must be the good stuff. [Sniffs.] Times like these I wish I had cancer. So what did she say?
We both know that as soon as we talked you ran to Stacy so you could gossip and giggle. I need to know what she said.
Because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.
What exactly did she say?
She's not gonna leave Mark in the middle of his rehab; too much guilt.
Harsh toke, dude.
Killjoy.
Mommy does everything for her family these days. Even swallows their pills.
Pop enough Ritalin, it can explain everything.
Half-life's 12 hours. The drugs'll be out of her system. We're done. Get rid of her.
Oh yes, the power tastes so sweet. You just can't resist. You're like a diabetic at the ice cream counter. You want to say no, but you need that chocolaty goodness.
Wuss.
So we don't ask *her.*
Candy striper. [Hooks chair with his cane pulls it toward himself. To Stella:] So, you like dogs? [Stella nods. House whistles; bends the balloon into… a shape.]
Well that's strange, because this bottle has her name on it. [Shakes it.] And I think these are medical pills inside.
Hmm. That's funny, 'cause the bottle's almost empty. [To Stella.] You missed a couple of days. Take five.
Why? Unless they're not hers. [To Stella.] You need some water, sweetie?
Come on. All the cool moms are doing it. And tox screen says you're cool too. [Pulls out paper and holds it out to her.]
Working late? Or are you just avoiding Mark?
So far. [Comes in.] I'm planning on keeping a chart.
You're leaving?
Yeah. Much better. Except for the whole walking thing.
Right; saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream. You're running away because the kiss meant something.
With Mark.
This better be important.
No I don't.
Oh, my God. Well, I'll be right there.
Traffic. Cinco de Mayo. [To Foreman.] You owe me a 100 bucks.
Fear trumps anal every time.
You have the test and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point. But if it's positive you lose… nearly 100, right?
Fine. Let's play doctors.
Nothing explains everything. What if it's a crime syndicate? Let's say Ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper. Ritalin takes care of the psychosis, the flailing--
Fertility meds are competitive by nature. They gotta do something bigger. Something really unexpected.
So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie. [They all get up and walk toward the door.]
Cameron. [She turns.] I love you. [Her jaw drops; he swabs her cheek.] Get your test results tomorrow. [She looks bewildered and leaves.]
I was trying for romantic. [They smile at each other and hug.] Still fits.
Did you tell Mark?
Pithy.
You already did the hurting part. He just doesn't know it yet.
She's on fertility treatments. She had a blood clot. It's there.
Right. They get babies. She had a blood clot and a stroke. She'll get another one and probably die if we don't find that tumor. Do an endometrial biopsy.
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Your four weeks just expired. Your reign of terror is over. Mine is just begun. Now go stick a needle up her hoo-hoo and find that cancer. [Goes into his office.]
TV. What are you doing here?
What nurse?
No.
Nope. [Raises eyebrows, takes feet down, and turns off the TV. Taking her hand they exit together and walk down the hall.]
Don't know.
War wound.
Every day.
They say that a lot?
Not ever?
Right. Forgot that. [The elevator arrives.] What floor was that nurse on who was watching you?
What?
What about her?
Your wife, your problem. [Walks away, Mark rolls after him.]
So what, you're gonna talk to me instead? Talk to your shrink.
Find a bar and talk to a stranger.
Didn't. [Turns and walks away again.]
Sorry; gotta go, people dying. [He turns and walks away.]
You're not ready for this.
You're an idiot. You probably just set your rehab back three months.
Liver tumor doesn't make sense.
I'm saying the symptoms don't add up. A + B does not equal liver tumor. We gotta solve for X. [He approaches board.] We gotta look at this differently. What do we know about her?
No. We've examined the file up and down. Come here. Give me that. Why do you people always overlook the human element? [Takes the file and tosses it in the garbage.] What do we know about her? Margo… [Checks the garbage.] Dalton; the woman.
Never fights with her husband.
So if she can't manage now, why does she want another kid?
Foreman. Need your help here. You want to pull a bank job. Would you go it alone? If you're gonna rob a home, sure. It's a one or two man crew. But a bank. Lookout. Getaway driver.
So here's the caper. Fertility meds create a distraction. Mommy had 3 refills on the Ritalin in the last 3 weeks. That team goes straight for the top floor. Has no trouble taking out communications [Crosses out Psychosis.], but--the specialist, Safe Cracker. All he does is stroke, blood clot, liver tumor. [Circles these on the board.] Foreman was right. This bad ass even does flailing. Come on. Only one guy I know does that kind of work.
While the surgeons are cutting out a chunk of your liver, should I have them do a hysterectomy too?
You don't have to lie to me. We're not married. You're supermom. You can do anything. You work seven days a week. You volunteer. Raise a kid. Yet you still somehow find the time to lie to hubby number two that you really, really want to give him a child with his chin and pretty brown eyes.
Because it fits. Birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma. Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained by your other lies.
[Pulls out a paper.] Also.
That I'm canceling the surgery. You can do the explaining. It's tricky, huh? It's one thing to say you can't have a baby. It's another to say you don't want one. Personally I'd make up some other lie.
Could you die if you tell him the truth?
If she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own.
Well if we do the surgery, maybe we'll kill her on the table. Then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy.
Why don't you take it up with Stacy? See which option minimizes your risk.
Shocking. It's benign.
No. Crazy is hanging out in the park all day talking to pigeons. Margo knows what she's doing. She gave up half her liver to save her marriage.
It's twisted and manipulative, I give you that. But it's also...romantic. [Wilson looks at him like he's nuts.] I'm barely willing to put the seat down after I pee.
Nope. I'm fine.
Something you need to see. [He holds out envelope. She looks at him nervously.] Knowing is always better than not knowing.
Right. HIV thing came in earlier. [He holds it up.] You're fine.
It said confidential. I wanted to know.
Comforting, isn't it? [She leaves.]
Hi.
Don’t do it.
I know.
Nothing. Nothing changes. I'm not going to change.
Mark is willing to do whatever it takes. I'm not. Never was.
You were happy with Mark. You'll be happy again.
How do you think this is gonna end? We'll be happy for what? A few weeks, few months; and then I'll say something insensitive, or I'll start ignoring you. And at first it'll be okay. It's just House being House. And then at some point, you will need something more. You'll need someone who can give you something I can't. [Stacy sighs.] You know I’m right. I've been there before.
It does. It does. [They sigh.] I don’t want to go there again. I'm sorry, Stacy. [He leaves, and she exhales forcefully.]
I told her she's better off without me.
Right. I sent her off on a whim.
Don't do this.
Deia rei marki. Deia rei marki! [Pronouncing something out of the book, Foreman enters.]
Been avoiding you. Burn unit can handle it.
Friend wrote an article.
They have a cutting edge neuroscience program in India. Says so right on the cover [He hands it over to Foreman and looks at the file.] Kid's heart rate's a mess. [He gets up.]
I assume the burn unit knew that.
His potassium's low.
Except I'm sure the burn unit's pumping him with fluids, which means his potassium should be going up, not down.
Or a bacteria lunching on his heart; or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.
Eww. 'Kay, no skin, no EKG.
What have you got a date or something? [He draws a deep breath.] 40% of his body, if the burns unit can prevent an infection, his body will regenerate maybe 10%, surgeons will do 20 or so grafts, 6 months in this room he'll end up with a series of nasty scars, maybe some pain but he'll live. [Some nurses in scrubs are washing Adam's burns and scrubbing away the burnt flesh.] Unless his heart shuts down because we can't figure out what's causing the low potassium and tachycardia. We need help from a Belgian doc named Eindhoven.
While he was alive he invented a little ditty called the galvanometer.
Go to an electronics store that's been open since before nineteen-o-five. There's a good chance they got one in the corner of the basement.
[Seemingly pleased with the results.] Oh yeah!
Look at that.
Oh no, no, no, no, no I gave him medication to prevent a migraine.
I did subsequently give him nitroglycerine which could possibly--
Gave him a little headache, similar to the one you're giving me now.
Well if you are to try out a new migraine prevention medication on someone who can actually feel pain...
Errr... yeah. [Grabs his cane.] We can talk later about the appropriate discipline. [Gives a low sexy growl and then limps out.]
[Walking in.] Who electrocuted my patient?
[Searching through some books on his shelves.] What does the seizure tell us? [Turns around to see Chase leaning against the desk.] Move.
Same as you - love, acceptance, solid return on investment. [Searching the papers on the desk.] Differential diagnosis, go.
[Finally finds the file he was looking for on another table and picks it up.] Well let's find out which, get an MRI. [Walks out.]
[Big sigh.] Ok. Lumbar puncture will tell us if his proteins are elevated and at least we can exclude MS. [Walks out again.]
You're cramping my exits. Don't tell me, no skin on his spine.
Transcranial doppler sonography.
I used one to look at a brain this morning.
[Looks behind to check if anyone's listening in.] Obviously I was doing something illegal and using nuclear imaging would have raised questions.
Not definitively, but patients with MS have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex. [He walks out yet again, but quickly peers back in.] Ok then.
[He shrugs.] No idea.
Sudden chills, and light sensitivity. Inexplicable.
Shhh...
The Dean threw me out. Von Lieberman just ratted on me.
I call him Weber von Lieberman. Way eviler. Shh.
I'm not here about the past, he's a bad scientist.
He got the answer wrong.
Shh! I'm trying to learn.
He doesn't even know what that means.
If I have a question.
Why can't you just enjoy this? Why can't you just be happy for me?
But I'm better at this.
Bleed in the head isn't causing seizures.
[Slightly too loud.] Shut up!
Not you.
Bahut shukriya (Thank you very much). [Wilson furrows his eyebrows in confusion.] As your people say in India, 'preciate it. [To Foreman.] We'll figure out why later. And fix the bleed or he dies. Talk to you in a couple of hours [Foreman leaves, to Weber.] Teri maa ki (Roughly translated "in your mother's.." yep he is cursing!) [He puts his hands together and nods his head in a gesture that clearly is supposed to mean thank you. The expression of confusion on Wilson's face is priceless.]
Err... excuse me doctor.
It's always been my understanding that err, unless you follow a daily regimen, no drug can prevent a migraine.
That's why YOU call it a breakthrough.
I'm sure your wife and lawyer do too. Is there anybody who doesn't stand to make a fortune from it calling a breakthrough?
And how exactly did these studies work? You give this drug to a bunch of people and if they don't get a migraine you go "voila, my drug works"? [He points to a lady sitting a few rows below him.] Erm, excuse me miss, uh do you have cancer? [She frowns in disbelief and shakes her head; House looks back up at Weber.] Wow! [He points to the bottle she's been drinking from.] Mango juice prevents cancer!
Sure, in India. Two plus two equals five there, right?
I know your math skills. They blow.
Why did you publish it in an obscure journal in India? Why not publish it in really, really cool head cases of South Philly?
Yeah. The guy running Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me its one of the best.
See I'm thinking that publishing studies is probably the easiest way to get a pharmaceutical company to give you a reach around. And choosing a journal that no one can actually read well that's... that's shrewd. [Wilson is going facepalm beside him.]
Sure you do. Dick.
Oh, my bad. Something to do with your face. I always think your name is Dick.
Here.
Yeah, you were always the grown-up. Do the responsible thing. Tattletale!
I cheated then, you're cheating now! Your drug doesn't work.
I tested it.
[Quickly looks over at Wilson.] Room 2134.
That's so close-minded. He's not abnormal, he's... special.
What? You mean while he was se-- [He suddenly gasps in the middle of the word and slams his hand down hard on to the table. Cameron jumps a little in surprise. House's expression could really either be interpreted as immense pleasure of the orgasmic variety, or immense pain.]
I'm having a migraine.
Hah. Yes. I was right. [A strong burst of pain hits him hard and he groans before pushing his clenched fists against his forehead.]
[Weakly.] No, I got work to do. Just give me sumatriptan for the pain and Verapamil so it doesn't recur. I heard the patient had fun in the hyperbaric chamber.
Gotta schedule me some time in there.
It’s legal in India. I was disoriented.
Nothing can hurt my heart.
Differential diagnosis for getting off. [Sits himself down on a chair at the big table.]
[Pushes the chair aside and lies down on the floor under the table.] Different diagnosis for ejaculation. [He takes a huge book off the table top and uses it as a pillow.] Don't make me say that again.
Then guess.
I wish.
Actually Chase has a point; the brain is like a huge train station. If the switches get-- [Looks like the pain is back full swing, he gasps.] -- you're the neurologist, talk for me.
He's a lucky kid. Let's not fix him until the burns heal.
All very bad things. No way to look for any of them in his condition.
Heyy! I do the metaphors.
Dominic Larrey.
He was Napoleon's Surgeon in Chief. Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.
And with bugs.
Ohh! [He grimaces.]
[Points at the mug.] Need something to wash it down.
Coffee's closer.
I had to prove--
Right. This isn't a migraine.
The meds are supposed to prevent migraine.
God I wish the pain, [Turns his head to give Wilson a pointed look.] would go away.
[Suddenly wakes up and looks at the Ducklings all looking worriedly at him.] Lower.
Not softer, lower. Frequency of your voice is grating.
I'm super. Patient?
Which means your regular old infection isn't causing his brain dysfunction, which means there's an underlying condition which means we gotta get inside his head. Do a lumbar puncture.
C2, C3.
Ask the parents if they prefer to have their son in a wheelchair, or dead.
His proteins aren't elevated?
What if there was tingling in his extremities prior to the crash?
I gotta be on something. Something's interrupting his neurons chitchat, like lesions.
What about Adam?
Good point.
Yeah, you can finish the sponge bath in a minute.
I didn't page you to put him out; I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?
Thank you. Come on, I need to talk to him.
He won't remember.
God you're good, you're putting me to sleep! I know he's going to be in pain, I know you disapprove, I'm his attending. Wake him up.
I'm Doctor House.
It's going to get a lot worse so answer fast. Before the accident did you experience any numbness or tingling in your fingers? [Adam looks down at the burns on his chest, he's panicking and scared and in a LOT of pain.] You got burned, it's healing. I need an answer!
Any tingling in your arms or legs?
Adam! You gotta listen to me! Did you feel anything?
Get everyone in my office. [He limps past her.]
Kid's screaming gave me a headache. Gotta take an aspirin.
[He slowly looks up at her.] I'm hallucinating.
I saw music.
Shhh... [We see Cameron through House's eyes, she's all blurred up. We also hear her from House's ears and she echoes badly.]
Why's it so dark in here? Beautiful day outside, open the shades, let the sun shine in.
It’s still Tuesday, right?
I took something.
Err... a little of this, little of that. And I was wrong with our patient, he's depressed.
Nope. Told me he pissed his pants and he blacked out.
Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what?
Which means the seizure he had when you tested his heart was at least a second seizure.
No, but you know what is? Depression and anti-depression medicine.
Yeah, but you know how much crap he's got in his system from dealing with those burns, the guy could have the Spanish Armada floating through his bloodstream and we wouldn't know about it. Until they started firing cannons.
This is a brain with too much serotonin.
Antidepressants fake brains into thinking they have more serotonin than they actually do. Every 10 million or so cases, sets off a chain reaction; produces too much, enough to fry itself.
Going to talk to the kid again, seems nice.
Why? Did he say he doesn't like me?
Everyone's a tattletale. [He switches off the lights in the office and leaves.]
Is your son depressed?
I'm doctor House.
If I didn't wake him, I wouldn't have learned what caused the crash. We think he had a seizure.
Well if he hadn't had the brain problem, he wouldn't have the burns. On the other hand, if you hadn't put him on the ATV, he also wouldn't have the burns. You can debate your personal responsibility after I leave. I need to wake him up again. I need to know if he's taking antidepressants.
But you don't know, do you?
Hmm... that's sorta my point. At sixteen, they'll tell anyone anything, except their parents.
Yeah, I know about the pot and the cocaine.
You sure? Are you having him followed?
Sixteen. Way to go.
But if he was depressed...
Bet-his-life-on-it sure? Just hypothetically.
Okay.
Kid's happy; happy, happy, happy.
Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms.
Would have seen it on the sonogram.
[Shakes his head.] Liver enzyme tests were normal. [He looks like he's thought of something and gets up to go out again.]
To take a leak.
Can't come in here, you're not sterile.
Seriously, millions of bacteria, microbes on you. He'll die of sepsis.
Oh if I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. Relax. Are they going to sue us? If I'm right, I save his life. If I'm wrong, he's dead no matter what I do. Either way, how much have I really hurt them? [House has loaded up a syringe with whatever it is he plans to inject Adam with.]
You're not sterile; do you want to kill the kid?
[Prepares to use the syringe.] No pain, no gain.
[Has paused by that point and is inspecting something on Adam's wrist.] They're right, he's not depressed.
What's that on his wrist?
Why on his wrist?
His back, his torso, everything's a mess, forearms are clean. Except right there.
It's a perfect circle.
Maybe. [He inspects Adam's fingers and finds a yellow nicotine stain on the side of Adam's middle finger.]
Does your son smoke?
[Smiles.] So, he talks to you about sex, crack, anything except cigarettes. He has a cigarette burn on his wrist, also a fading nicotine stain between two fingers. Bad news, your son has a filthy, unhealthy habit. Good news, he's trying to quit. Bad news, the quitting is killing him. Good news, I can cure him. Bad news... nope, that's the end of it.
No-smoke meds are antidepressants. Crappy ones you can get over the internet are loaded with whatever antidepressants they can get cheap. [Foreman walks out and hands House his cane.] Since mommy and daddy obviously didn’t take him to a pediatrician. Sorry I was wrong about him being depressed. [To Foreman.] Treat him.
[Swivels his chair around.] Why would I do that?
How about because LSD acts on serotonin receptors in the brain which can stop a migraine in its tracks? I'm just saying that's also a possibility. How did you know about it?
Well, either that or I also took a whole bunch of antidepressants which short-circuited the LSD. I'm just saying that would also explain it.
You're kidding, really?
I didn't know people actually read emails. The delete button is so conveniently located--
Why would I do that?
No. We're even.
An eye for an eye, LSD and antidepressants. Everything in balance. [He starts tossing the ball into the air and then catching it.] Buddhists call it karma and Christians call it the golden rule, Jews call it... [Cuddy gives inquiring look.] I don't know. Rabbi Hillel said something poignant. Universe always settles the score.
No, but it should.
Hey Paula.
I'm looking for a distraction. You don't need to talk to do that, do you?
By osmosis.
Didn’t seem like riding weather.
Infarctions hurt that’s what they do.
Could be good, could be bad. Thanks for the differential. Any other options?
I did the rehab thing.
The guy wanted me to visualize the healing. (e opens his pills.) I can do that at home.
It’s a very simple equation; more pain, more pills. (He takes a pill.)
You had me at teenage supermodel. (He enters the elevator.)
Wow you should be a model. Are you really 15?
I’ll be the one saving her life today; assuming she’s dying. Who are you?
From the looks of it, not a single thing. I probably should stop staring and check out the file. So what set off the brawl? She stand in your light?
I’m sure she was delightful in her youth. And then you passed out.
Yeah, sounds like a medical thing. It’s called cataplexy; cat fight and cataplexy on the catwalk. Cool. How much were you drinking?
Forget it. We’ll find out from the tox screen.
No. How long have you had the sweats?
Any other complaints?
Okay. Here’s how this works; my lackeys will be by shortly to draw some blood, collect some urine, any other fluids you’ve got, they’ll do some other doctorly stuff and we’ll be in touch. (He walks out into the hall where Cameron is waiting.)
Have you seen her?
Yeah, but there’s something about her. Something in her eyes, a kind maturity.
She’s a fashion model, on the cover of magazines. They hold her up as a sexual ideal; the law says we can’t touch her for three more years. How hypocritical is that?
History. Right, knew I was forgetting something. You should do one of those while you’re writing the labs and the tox screen. (He hands her the file.)
He’s right.
Evidence to the contrary; the rounded hips, the perfectly sculpted bountiful breasts.
Symptomatic of turning fourteen. Two clinic hours says that those love apples were hand crafted by God. (Foreman scoffs.)
I do now.
Could be relevant. Come on Cameron, there’s nothing to be ashamed of, many women develop breasts -- (He gets up while he’s talking and stumbles, they all look at him.) No, I’m fine.
Detox her.
And in four weeks we’ll know you’re right. Or we’ll know that Cameron’s right and the pretty girl will do Milan next fall in a wheelchair. Put her in a coma, pump her full of naltrexone.  Cut the four weeks to one night.
She’s not dead.
I don’t think so. (He starts to walk away.)
(He stops and faces the father.) Did you ever get a paper cut? A really nasty one, between the fingers? Multiply that by about a billion and you just barely approach the kind of suffering she’ll experience if we wake her up now. We’re committed to this. She’s out till morning go get a book. (He walks away.)
Oh, poor you. (He pulls out his pills.)
I take it you’re married. (He takes a pill.)
You must be witty. When’s she due?
Because I’m doing her. You’ve got couvades syndrome; which is just a fancy way of saying you should stop whining. Millions of women have got the same thing, they’re not bugging me. You’re suffering from sympathetic pregnancy. Gotta go. People dying. Whole circle of life thing. (He gets up to leave.)
No, it’s all in your hormones. Good news is no ones gonna lecture you if you smoke and get drunk.
Cameron, Chase and the dark one; Foreman, right? Patient flat lined for like 30 seconds, got to be oxygen deprived for longer than that to lose brain function.
Her brain’s fine.
No. I’m saying what I’m saying. Her brain’s fine.
She’s got post traumatic stress disorder.
Show me a woman on heroin who looks like that (He hold up a magazine picture of Alex.) and I’ll show you a woman who’s been sexually abused.
He manages her career, travels the world with her, at her side 24/7; he’s either a very good dad or a very bad dad. You saw that tuchas, would the fact that she’s your daughter really stop you?
Her brain is running away from reality.  When the drugs can’t do it anymore it starts to shut down.
When you guys are done talking do an MRI and an LP; when her brain checks out as normal then we’ll know that daddy really, really loves her.
I had a funny uncle.
It’s personal.
You got a problem with a call I make, question the call don’t make it personal.
(House looks like it may have made an impact.) Thank you. Are you doing your daughter?
We should probably talk privately huh, come on, walk with me. (Foreman shakes his head.)
He’s not. Sure he’s not. She is a babe though.
Your glands are fine. So now you’re my patient. You’ve got doctor-patient confidentiality, no worries. So what did you do to her?
Hard to imagine anyone not wanting to nail her.
It’s a compliment. The heart shaped ass, those perfect perky all natural breasts.
No, that’s your daughter you were talking about. (House opens his magazine.) ‘She just instinctively knows how to walk. Designers just love that heart shaped ass, those perfect perky--’
Oh, that makes sense. So you compartmentalize. When you’re dealing with the press you’re her manager. When you’re helping with homework you’re her dad. When you’re making sweet, sweet love you’re her manager.
Do you love her?
Do you love her?
Do you love her enough to admit that you slept with her? Psychological conditions can manifest themselves in physical problems. Sometimes these can be extreme enough to kill. There are treatments, but only if there’s a diagnosis. Are you going to admit that you slept with your daughter or are you just gonna let her die?
PTSD. Get her a psych referral and pack her bags. He did her.
Daddy thinks so. Could be mistaken, said he was drunk, could be some other daughter.
Doctor-patient confidentiality.
Is it okay if I save her life first or do you want to make sure daddy doesn’t get visitation rights to the grave site?
It’s got windows. (She glares at him.) Fine, arrest him. Use Cuddy’s handcuffs.
(Loud and angrily.) Yeah, I’m distracted. I’m all hung up on this fifteen year old patient who’s cataplectic, can’t remember what she had for lunch and is rapidly losing control of her body. And I want her father here in case they’ve got any more secrets that I need to know about. Now, if you’re not too distracted go take out a piece of her brain and stick it under a microscope. (He sees Wilson out in the hall.) Wilson! (Wilson stops and waits.)
No, lets keep playing pin the diagnosis on the supermodel until she’s dead. (House joins Wilson in the hallway.)
Only for a minute.
Three. I need your help.
Look, I’m a little busy right now. Not supposed to talk during these things. Got time Thursday?
(Smiling.) You’ll have to check with Cameron.
Quick, God, smite the evil witch! (Wilson wisely says nothing.)
God, why have you forsaken me?
I figured as much.
You think I have a conversion disorder? You want me to see a shrink.
Listen none of this has anything to do with Stacey.
Aw. You miss Stacey too?
Cameron, you going to tell Cuddy or has she already got you wired for sound?
So white is out, that just leaves grey.
You had to do what you thought was right. They call it grey area because you never really know what’s there. We can’t test for any of those things.
You can torture yourself all you want. What if everything we’re seeing, is just smoke signals.
Tumor. If she has cancer anywhere in her body, she could also have paraneoplastic syndrome which could be causing antibodies to attack her brain. Antibodies are stupid that way.
Fifteen year olds who look like that are awfully rare. It would explain the aggressive behavior, the cataplexy, the memory loss, even the twitching. It’s perfect.
Then let’s make sure it is there.
Sure there is, the squeeze the tube test.
But the twitching should stop right about now. (The twitching stops.)
Could’ve just been a coincidence. Twitching does tend to stop and start. Let’s be sure. (He squeezes the tube and she twitches.) The IVIG vacuums her blood neutralizes the stuff that’s making her twitch. It’s actually kind of cool. (He does it again.) I wonder if could make you dance.
No, all I did was prove that she has cancer.
I need a favor.
It’ll help us both. I need a shot of morphine in my spine.
It’s not enough. Get a syringe.
Yeah, write that on the insert.
I don’t want them knowing.
That I’m in this much pain. I don’t want them questioning my judgment. I can’t ask Wilson because he figures its all in my head.
(He throws his cane and pulls his pants down.) Well, what about this?
Is this in my head? (Whoa, he has a wicked scar.) Cause I could swear I remember a thigh muscle being here. (He breathes heavily.)
It’s gotta be cancer.
So I just randomly predicted she’d respond to IVIG? Her twitches are gone, her memory’s getting better.
If the increased pain’s psychological, no drugs gonna help.
You’re right. The more I talk to you, the more the pain floods back. (He looks at a scan.) Knew the twins were real. Chase owes me. You check the pancreas?
You check the bones? There are a lot if bones, I think.
Ovaries?
Differential diagnosis.
You gotta learn to let go Foreman.
(Snaps fingers.) Wrong. What it wouldn’t have done was medically disappear, nothing to stop it from magically disappearing. She was watching me start and stop the medicine.
Not consciously, but if her subconscious is trying to get away from it all cancer’s got to be a lovely vacation spot. Tell her you’ve got to give her a fresh IV. Don’t tell her you’re starting her on saline. See if the twitching comes back.
How did you get my pager number?
Problem is if I give you an epidural you won’t be able to feel when to push.
Pretty sure I am. You just can’t appreciate it because you’re in pain.
Oh shut up! You’ve got yourself the perfect man; a woman. He’s got more estrogen coursing through his veins—(Light bulb.)
Who did her vaginal exam?
Did she have hair?
Right now I’m getting at whether or not she had hair down there.
She’s manipulative, yet completely docile. Everybody tells us that outburst on the catwalk was out of character. She’s never had a period.
I’m thinking she’s the ultimate woman. (He stops to speak to a nurse who is on the phone.) I… (He hangs up the phone by pressing the button.) I need to schedule an MRI.
Because we changed your medicine back to the real stuff. Stop talking.
That’s what I said; in the vain hope that you wouldn’t feel the need to also say it. Stop talking.
The ultrasound would be the way to go if you were looking for ovarian cancer.
That.
Looks like a tumor doesn’t it?
Yep.
We found a tumor.
Technically, no.
No, it’s cancer. But, he has cancer, on his left testicle.
His DNA says you’re wrong. Frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. You’ve got male pseudohermaphroditism. See we all start out as girls and then we’re differentiated based on our genes. The ovaries develop into testes and drop. But in about 1 in 150,000 pregnancies a fetus with an XY chromosome, a boy, develops into something else. Like you. Your testes never descended because you’re immune to testosterone. You’re pure estrogen, which is why you get heightened female characteristics; clear skin, great breasts. The ultimate woman is a man. Nature’s cruel, huh?
No, a joke would be me calling you a homo. See the difference? I’ll schedule him for surgery.
Anger, it’s just the cancer talking. Put your clothes back on. I’m going to cut your balls off. Then you’ll be fine. (She covers up, crying and looks at her dad who turns to look out the window.)
Post op. I sent him slash her up for a psyche visit.
Good news is, I don’t think dad’s going to be sleeping with him slash her again. See, now it’s gross. I need another shot.
A few hours ago.
If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed I’d get Wilson to give me the shot.
If you would be more comfortable, I might be able to deal with a few CC’s less morphine.
What did you give me? I told you I wanted--
Cool.
No. That's impossible.
The shoes aren't right. [Chase and Cameron are confused of course] Here's how testicular cancer would manifest itself. First the patient would get the exact symptoms that he's got, then Foreman would examine him, then he'd suspect testicular cancer on the count of the symptoms being so perfect, then he'd stick a needle in it, then he'd call a surgeon. And while that guy operates, the rest of us would be out bowling. And since we're not wearing bowling shoes, the disease obviously did not progress in that fashion.
Sure, if you call a micro-abscess in his brain "clean".
What you don't trust me?
Neat! You can see through my hand!
Or it's an infection. When guys have brain-crotch problems, it's usually the result of using one too much and the other too little.
So treat him for all 3. Stat.
No, negative means he probably doesn't have it, which means he probably has cancer.
We're wearing the wrong shoes for testicular cancer. They're perfect for lymphoma. [he looks down at their shoes] Except Chase's, they're just goofy.
Lymphoma could cause infiltrates in his reproductive organs and his brain. If it does advance he's dead no matter what we do. [he starts to walk out the door] So give him the STD meds, and hope the tests were wrong.
Spinook. [takes up the box of chocs] Who's the lucky woman?
No, I don't want to know who gets the chocolates; I want to know who you're having the affair with.
Norwegian chocolate. Frankly, you buy that stuff the terrorists win.
Gifts express guilt. The more expensive the expression, the deeper the guilt. That's a 12 dollar box so that means you haven't slept with her yet, or she wasn't that good.
Really? When did that change?
[is surprised, but hides it as he closes the door] Actually, at your age, as long as you're careful, the risk of you getting pregnant is pretty limited.
You mean calm as in... peaceful lake on a cool summer evening? Or in the lesser used meaning of nothing can ever bother you again because life has absolutely no meaning? High dose of depo provera will chemically castrate you.
[draws a deep breath] Ok... I'm going to get up to leave now. I'm going to walk to that door, turn the handle, and then you're suddenly going to decide that you have to tell me the truth. I'm going to have to turn around and come all the way back. You see the thing is, my leg hurts. Can we cut the walking out of the equation?
[is puzzled. Pops a vicodin] Any particular variety? Guernseys? Holstein?
Oh god.
Make love, not belts. Beautiful.
Oh relax; it's something we doctors deal with all the time. And I'm going to write you the name of a drug, you don't need a prescription and looks just like depo provera.
Oh god no. That stuff has all sorts of nasty side effects. It's real medicine. Now this is all you need, your frat buddies will be completely fooled. You tell them how appalling the doctor was, lots of laughs.
I didn't ask him to take the medicine; I asked you do give him the medicine.
He's lying.
[spots Wilson talking to a nurse] Wilson! How long can you go without sex?
No seriously, a week? A month?
I didn't say you were. Not in this conversation. [Wilson looks fed up and walks away] I'm talking about a patient!
Well not like air, but as a biological imperative, sure we do. There's two things we get stupid for - money and sex, and since money rarely enters the bloodstream. Was his daughter in the room when you asked if he had sex?
[checks his watch] It's almost noon. The little girl would go to lunch. Soon as she's out the door, you're going to get paged. Then you page me.
Lunch is early huh?
Hi, I'm doctor House. I hear you'd rather die than admit you had sex.
Right, coz she's what? 22?
She probably knows that's happened already. Roll over.
[he takes out some needles and preps them] So smart. You must be very proud. Roll over.
Is that the one that makes you pants feel funny? I'm starting you on a cocktail of STD meds.
Cheese is the devil's plaything.
Well you're obviously completely over her.
You're certainly setting a good example for her.
He met a woman in church.
Crash cart!
Shut up.
40 milligrams (some drug, I can't make out what he's saying above the beeping of the monitors) Knock him out.
It wouldn't.
So what is it? A disease that attacks his brain, heart and testicles. I think Byron wrote about that.
Way to a man's heart is through his stomach. [he circles "Acid Reflux" on the whiteboard]
Seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them. [He tosses the marker to Chase; Foreman looks suspicious as he tries to work out what House is thinking]
You don't need this so much. [he extubates Henry] Problem is not your lungs, it's your heart. That Italian cheese thing at the church - what sort of cheese?
I'm having a fondue party. Was it sheep cheese?
Was it soft?
Taste like crap?
[takes a container out of his pocket and pops a small cube of cheese into Henry's mouth] Taste like this?
That was regular low fat American. I added some bacteria for flavour.
It's pretty much on everything. Especially the unpasteurised sheep cheese they make in the Alps. That stuff will give you brucellosis. Key to a long life - exotic women, and boring cheese. I'm going to start you on rifampin and doxycycline.
99.9% of "Christians" have so much acid in their stomach they become churning cauldrons of death for all those nasty brucellosis bugs. But you were taking antacids for your acid reflux, so that turns your digestive tract into a pleasant scenic river for all those bacterial tourists. [CGI of acid in stomach killing bacteria, then of Henry's stomach where the bacteria just float through]
Absolutely. Your socks don't match, which means you got out dressed in the dark, which means you don't want to wake your wife which means you don't want to talk to her, which means--
Oh that. No. Come on, I'm basing it on cheese!
We'll know before that. If I'm wrong, he'll just keep getting worse and slowly die. And if I'm right, either we caught it in time he gets better, or we didn't and he goes into cardiac arrest at any moment. [House SCORES at foosball!]
Are you going to tell her?
Because you think that getting it off your chest will let you sleep better. It won't. You'll end up sleeping on my lumpy couch.
Why are you playing foosball here at 8 o' clock at night?
[starts walking off] Go home and have sex with your wife.
Other than that, how's he doing? [the Ducklings look a little disbelieving] Seriously. His brain, testicle, lungs, tonsils. How's all that other stuff doing?
So... all he needs is a heart, and he's out of here.
He's a prime candidate for transplant. Doesn't smoke. Drinks moderately. His tox screen is negative for illegal drugs, and legal ones. Surveillance blood culture show absolutely no sign of any lingering brucella bacteria.
Told me he was 65. Liar. I'm out of here.
He's in excellent health. This was his first hospitalisation since breaking his leg at 23. Or 22, I'm not sure anymore.
So you're saying that old people aren't as worth saving as young people?
No I get it; women live longer so they should get preference, right? The African-Americans, they die a lot younger so to hell with them.
If the test is who gets to use it the longest, you can either be a racist or a hypocrite.
How old are you, doctor? When do we get to toss you on an ice flow?
Oh I'm on pins and needles. I wonder how you'll decide.
They made the right call.
I was advocating for my patient. [he signs the letter anyway]
Advocating for my patient. I gotta go clinic duty. I need you to get me the files on everybody who dies here today.
[as he walks out] Nope!
Moooo!
Which one?
Not which type, which one? I want a name.
Not "it", she. Or he. I wanna know her dreams, her hopes.
Hey, I'm not the one who said he was in love. People who actually have this condition rationalise it, they dismiss it, they don't elevate it to the level of poetry. Plus there's a wooden splinter in there. So either you hit yourself with a 2 by 4 or Elsie has a pick leg. I'm off duty at 6, give yourself another whack and come back and scam somebody else.
Technically I don't have to treat anybody before running a series of painful and often humiliating tests. [he takes out a needle and shows it off to intimidate the patient]
Unless she has a bionic heart. What's next?
Babies are useless, they got hearts the size of ping-pong balls. Next.
Yes?
If you really cared about me, you'd find me a better corpse.
Bad one I hope.
Give me her file.
Age?
Young, damn.
Smoker?
Find out. [pops a vicodin]
Overweight?
Excellent. Our odds just went up.
60% of potential donor hearts get tossed in the trash because there's something wrong with them. With fat people, it's closer to 80.
Big fat sloppy heart beats no heart all [he winks at her before getting into the elevator and the door closes]
Are you Mr Neuberger?
I'm Doctor House. Need to ask you a few questions about your wife.
I'm afraid I don't know that. Could you tell me about her accident?
Any problems with her health until now?
Police say it's important.
How high?
Any other symptoms?
I didn't know. Shouldn't have made assumptions.
I'm sorry for your loss, but I need your wife's heart.
Means we got lucky, either that or she's getting lunch. [he chases Cameron away from the computer] Dead woman's last name have a 'u' or a 'w'?
Is that a problem for you?
[types it into the computer then starts reading the file] Three minutes ago... her organs were officially declared not viable. Time to go dumpster diving.
Fortunately, she didn't have Hep C.
Her history says otherwise. Her husband told me she was running a fever with stomach pains, not symptomatic of Hep C.
Again, sorry. But we need to talk.
His wife signed an organ donor card.
I can use them! I just need some time! Committee says they won't take her heart. Another committee says a guy can't have a heart. It's a marriage made in heaven. I can find a surgical team that can do this. Classify it as experimental, it's not going to screw with any numbers. This is what she wanted; she wanted her organs to help another--
She's not, she's dead! She's not in pain, she's not suffering. It's just her... meat we're dealing with here.
Not anymore.
I respect the living.
I never said that I was her doctor.
It's not over.
This girl's father will die by next weekend unless he gets your wife's heart.
No, it's hugely manipulative.
Hey listen, you take your wife off life support, and I'll have forgotten about this in two weeks. Gale here on the other hand--
Whatever. You're mad at me, fine I get that, take it out on me, not on her.
Fever, stomach pain, raised liver enzymes.
Worse than that, she's dead.
Yeah. So what is it? Enzymes indicate--
We're going to cure her.
MWAHAHAHAHA. Doubt it. Just want to get the infection out of her heart before we get the heart out of her. The fever indicates an infection.
Let's assume, just for fun, that the answer is something that might be helpful.
Like that. Do an MRI, stat.
Question was never is it Hep C? Question was given that it's not Hep C, what is it?
What if she was sloppy about washing her hands after pooping?
The amebias started in her liver and spread to her blood, that would explain all her symptoms. Except for the crushed skull but I'm assuming that's from the car crash.
[taking a patient file] 10 grams each.
Right. So we'll destroy her retinas and damage her hearing. Whoever wants those parts is having a very bad day. Couple of hours on the meds and she'll be feeling great.
Got your labs. Do you eat guinea pigs?
How about hamsters? Or mice? Humans?
Absolutely nothing. Blood work is perfect. You got lots of vitamins, minerals, all kinds of proteins. Including a little something I like to call 'bovine serum albumin' which you get from eating the animals mentioned. Or cow. You don't really worship cows. So I have to wonder, what could be more humiliating than someone calling your girlfriend a cow and not being metaphorical.
[takes the photo] Nice.
Well either that's a very old photograph or it's your step mom.
Still. Cows.
Step.
[takes out paper to write the prescription] You're not going to have any fun at graduation. [Patient sighs in relief]
Keep up the good work. [he walks around to the other side of the counter] Your shirt is ironed. That means you haven't told your wife anything.
[halts on his way out of the clinic] You're saying I'm right?
[is silent. His pager goes off] Does it occur to you that if you need that kind of a friend, that you may have made some deeper errors.
Stop the meds.
Either we're wrong, and our heart is unusable, or we're right, but the treatment we have to give her will make her heart unusable. I'm sorry. You can pull the plug now. Find me another body. That fat guy on the other end of the service didn't look so hot.
You were ready this morning.
Alternate theories?
What's our second best hope?
She's a fridge with the power out. We start poking around inside, the vegetable goes bad. No offence.
Those things never cover for any of the really cool toxins. [to Foreman] Run the screen again for... whatever you can think of. [to Chase] You keep the other patient alive, [to Cameron] you check out her school, and I seem to need to hire another doctor to go search her home. [to Donald] Come on.
[inspects some stuff inside a cupboard] Does your wife dye her hair?
[takes out a bottle of hair dye and closes the cupboard] Guess this must be yours then. Can you think of anything else she might have lied to you about? Any drugs she "gave up" when she married you?
Do you use this drawer?
[checks the bottles] And sleeping pills.
Ok. [shows another bottle] You on a diet?
Quite the insight. She lied to you about her hair colour, and didn't want you to know she thought she was fat. Unless you never lied to her about anything that huge, I think you can probably let those slide.
But not the fever.
Like what?
[takes the photos from her and starts going through them] Neither interesting nor helpful. [until he finds photos of naked boys doing interesting things] This at least is interesting.
Sex with teenagers isn't interesting? Where did you grow up?
[deep in thought] What if the cyst isn't a cyst?
I said it's not a cyst, I didn't say it was nothing. What if it's a scar?
You have anything better? Test her. Then start her on ceftriaxone.
I think that's the first time those words have been uttered in joy.
Start him on dobutamine.
[thinking for a moment] Hopefully tomorrow, it'll be in his system. [he picks up the phone and makes the call] I need two ORs and the transplant team.
She... had amebiasis. We just found a different way to get rid of it.
I didn't want him going postal on us. Soon as his wife's heart's in our hands, you can tell him about the gonorrhea. [Cameron gives him a look] He's gotta be tested. Preferably before he gets any sympathy sex.
You idiot. You told her.
Want a beer?
You blow dry your hair?
You blow dry your hair?!
I think the word you’re looking for is obsessing. You’ve been at it for almost an hour.
I don’t want in, I want sleep!
This isn’t gonna work.
You. Staying here. [Taking Vicodin.]
You think we should try counseling first? Why d’you want to sleep on a couch, anyway? You’ve got money. At least until the divorce is finalized.
Awesome, a sex fiend with a swollen tongue. Just think of all the places I can make Foreman search. [He appears to be trying to poke a hole off of a pop-top can with a sharp object. Smart.]
No such thing. [He gets a hole, and quickly drinks the can from the hole in the bottom. Now, that’s a way to consume an energy drink!]
Testing a new caffeine delivery system.
A hundred bucks says they’re as miserable as the next couple.
You’re looking for something. If you’re happy, you’ve got nothing to look for.
Okay, I say we stop the DDX and discuss that comment.
[writing on the whiteboard] What if the problem’s not in his throat?
Says who?
Since most patients can’t tell their ulna from their anus, I’m guessing this guy also doesn’t know the difference between choking and suffocating. His throat might be fine, his lungs might be messed up. Get more blood, a chest CT and a body plethysmograph. Unless, of course, you think we should be asking the patient where his anus is, first. [He leaves.]
Pull up your pants.
Nope, not your prostate. Herpes.
Herpes. Your turn. If it makes you feel any better, half the patients who come into this place have some sort of crotch rot.
Had any sex in those 20 years?
Then that’s how you got it.
Bummer. Take this, once a day. Tell your wife to do the same. It’s not going to cure it, but it’ll lessen the frequency of the outbreaks.
You got any kids?
Any of them take guitar lessons?
Tennis, art, acting?
Give this to her sensei. Oh, wait, does your wife play tennis?
That’s what I figured. It never hurts to make sure. [gives him another script] For Miyagi.
Can’t be idiopathic. Idiopathic means “without a known cause.”
What you meant was you don’t know what the cause is, just say that and we can avoid this conversation. [He stops juggling, catching the oversized tennis ball behind his back.] No applause? [Chase starts to move his hands, but stops. Bwah.] What’s his current condition?
Then we can wait.
For whatever you can’t figure out to cause something else. You know it’s going to.
Now we’ve got something to discuss. What causes both lung scarring and the itchy, red blotches?
Right, but what besides what’s obviously not caused both the lung scarring and the splotches? [He heads toward the bathroom.]
To complete the second half of the caffeine delivery system. Either talk loud or get in here. [Foreman and Chase enter, Cameron decides to talk loud.] Same color coming out as going in – think that’s a marketing thing?
Did we? Where’s Cameron?
[yelling] Need an allergy expert in here! [Cameron rolls her eyes and enters.]
You don’t know that. Chase thinks that food allergies should still be on the table.
No. Lungs, skin. Skin, lungs. Sklungs? Lungs, skin. Throat. [He stares at the rust on the urinal’s plumbing.] Heavy metal toxicity. It explains the lungs, the itching, the swelling in the tongue and throat.
I never said I didn’t believe it. I just said I had good reason to doubt it.
Now I have good reason to doubt those doubts.
Now aren’t you glad you joined us? Search their house, and screen his hair and blood for lead. And test for mercury and arsenic while you’re at it. Chase, find out what the resort cooks with, if they’ve repainted recently or did any plumbing repairs.
Then it’ll be challenging.
Good Lord, what is that smell?
Stuffed with what? Vomit? [He opens the closet to put in his coat, and has to kick things out of the way to close it again.] I thought you were going to a hotel.
What’s today? Where’d you get all that stuff?
Don’t you ever eat anything that doesn’t look like it’s been rolled onto your plate by a dung beetle?
No. Just better than it looks. How much beans and rice d’you think you’d have to eat from a ceramic pot painted with lead-based paint to get enough lead in your system to damage your lungs?
Adult.
It’s a complete moron working with power tools – how much more suspenseful can you get? [He grabs the remote.]
No, you’re about to watch something. I’m watching something. See the difference.
You think ants are the problem?
These aren’t pancakes. These are macadamia nut pancakes. Wilson made them and they’re amazing.
Little silver dollar slices of heaven.
Forget the 72 virgins. If I blow myself up in a crowded restaurant, I think I’m asking for a plate of these babies. [Cameron has naked desire on her face.] Was the ant small and red or big and black?
Halle Berry brown or Beyonce brown?
[to Foreman] Is there a difference. Army ants could devour, dissolve, eat a cow in a matter of hours. Australian bull ants, on the other hand, are nasty little bastards, but more of a nuisance than a threat. [Chase nods his agreement.] No surprise there.
Well then, that’s not it. How much clay did he eat at the resort?
Tox screen?
Run them again. Call the resort, find some disgruntled employee to talk to. Go back to the home –
The symptoms say it is.
Well, who’re you gonna believe? The symptoms or the test?
Cameron says it’s not.
Start treating him for lead poisoning, it’s the most likely heavy metal. And yeah, you can test him for allergies for dairy, wheat, and legume. [The team leaves. Chase tries to steal a pancake but House slaps his hand away.]
More significantly, it’s yet another classic sign of heavy metals.
No. Lupus progresses slower, there’d be joint pain.
It’s not lupus! The symptoms don’t match.
Heavy metal toxicity could cause vomiting.
He’s choking on his tongue, not his feet.
Still not his throat, but you’re getting closer.
If you’re so sure, why waste time with tests? Start treatment. Oh no, wait, you can’t do that, because we already have and it’s not working, ergo –
Only if we confirm the diagnosis with an ANA, serum complement, anti-DNA, IV pyelogramic kidney biopsy.
The symptoms –
There’s no lettuce.
Actually, I’m in the middle of –
Well, how was I supposed to know?
That’s kind of selfish, don’t you think?
Ah, that was before I tasted the pancakes. It’s a compliment, you should be flattered. [Cuddy enters.]
Mrs. who?
What would you do if you got herpes?
Actually, I’d know what you’d do. But, I mean, a normal guy.
He suspected that his wife had also been playing the pickle games, he’d just keep it on the down-low. Just wait ‘till she got infected.
Of course, maybe it was the wife. Maybe she was the one who – [And with the Music of Epiphany, House has figured something out about the Patient of the Week.]
Where’s Mrs. Nympho?
Go search her.
If I’d meant that, good chance I’d’ve said that.
His symptoms should be getting better the longer he’s here, instead they’re getting worse.
Because there’s no reason to test for the other thirty. They don’t get into the air or food, they only get in you if someone puts them in you. The only way we’re going to find out what she’s been sprinkling on his corn flakes is to search her.
It’s the only explanation. We’ve eliminated every other possibility.
Has he responded to the latest lupus treatment?
He hasn’t responded because it’s not lupus! It’s not allergies, ALS, arthritis or sarcoidosis. She’s all that’s left. Do it!
Hi, I’m Dr. House. Mind if I take a look in your purse?
Because I’m going to need to search it and you for whatever you’re using to poison your husband.
Then you won’t mind if I search your things.
She agreed to let me search everywhere else, but this she says no to. Doesn’t that tell you something?
Cameron can do that.
The woman hasn’t left the hospital since they arrived. Whatever she’s using she’s obviously hiding somewhere.
It’s the only explanation!
And you are protecting a complete stranger based on some childishly romantic notion that people are all so happily married they don’t want to kill each other!
Grow up.
There’s no music room, it’s the conservatory.
No, it isn’t. If we don’t find out what she’s using, start treatment immediately, he’ll be dead in a week.
You did your maid?
Maybe she was doing her.
But you still feel responsible. Even though nothing or no one was done, it’s still your fault.
You’re supposed to be moving out, not moving more people in.
Maybe I should just move out, and the two of you could –
So, let’s say she’s not poisoning him.
Yeah, and interferon.
True. But it’s pretty much the only thing we can do for a viral infection. We didn’t consider it because it doesn’t –
Because he’s got no immune system, thanks to the immunosuppressant you prescribed him for lupus treatment.
Because at that point he was a post-viral autoimmune reaction, which again, thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribed for lupus treatment, his immune system basically rolled out the red carpet for the dormant virus, waking it up, turning it into a present viral infection. Give him interferon.
Which is more likely, a rapidly progressing, acute onset lupus in a patient who’s already on steroids or a team of doctors missing a post-viral reaction?
Well, then, I’m wrong, and you shouldn’t. Give him interferon!
Up the dose.
Apparently not enough.
Increase the interferon.
You got a better idea, other than lupus?
Then up the dose.
Sorry, I was sick. And my team needed an emergency consult. Your wife has herpes.
You haven’t had an outbreak. Yet. Don’t worry, you will.
Doesn’t mean he got it first. You don’t need to have an outbreak to spread the virus.
Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk about.
Either of you two ever sit on a public toilet? Well?
Herpes can live for short periods of time outside the body.
Some politically correct doctors will tell you that it’s impossible to get infected by a toilet seat, but they’ll also tell you not to use the same bath towel to dry your crotch and your face during an outbreak. See the contradiction?
Always?
What about you?
Damn, I was sure it was Miyagi.
He could believe that you could get herpes from a toilet seat, or he could be cheating on you and be happy to have an out.
Sure, but she’d only refuse to believe such a well presented lie if she were innocent. And since you both can’t be innocent, you ruddy jackass.
My pleasure.
She has a family history of arthritis, doesn’t she?
Stop the interferon. Do another heavy metal screen, only this time test for gold.
And don’t let her go to the bathroom!
Oh!
What did you do to my closet?
It’s not Dr. Wilson’s closet! [And all the slashers go hee!] Where’s the wood box?
Yes, the wood box. It’s made of wood, and it’s box-shaped. It’s been in the back of this closet since the day I moved in.
Well, you may not have seen it, but you’ve obviously moved it. The question is, where?
Look, it was in this closet, then you came, now it’s not in this closet!
Wood! Wood! It’s a brown, wood box, it’s got a metal handle, it looks like a tackle or a toolbox –
[pocketing the desired bottle] Um, thanks.
Where is she?
I told you not to let her.
Why not, she likes that. [He tosses his cane to Chase and works on opening the bottle while walking to the bathroom.]
Sorry, must be nervous. I got some bad news.
The damage to your husband’s lungs is permanent. Kidney damage is reversible and with the right therapy he should regain full neurological function. Other than the fact that he’s not going to be running any marathons, he’s going to be fine.
I’m not finished. When I was a kid, my dad was stationed at a marine base in Egypt. We were in the middle of nowhere and there was absolutely nothing for a kid to do except look for a mummy’s tomb.
I didn’t have a problem with you going to the bathroom. I just didn’t want you to wash your hands. I never actually did find a mummy, but I did learn a fair amount about the ancient Egyptians. For example, they discovered that stannous chloride is not only great for toughening ruby glass, but if it’s mixed with gold, it turns bright purple. [He turns over Maria’s hand, which is turning purple.] Now, either your fingers are actually worth their weight in gold, or you’ve been sprinkling your husband’s cereal with gold sodium thiomalate. It’s an arthritis remedy it’s rarely used here in the US, but it’s still popular in Mexico. I’ve gotta give you props. I’ve never heard of anyone using gold before. It’s almost… poetic.
Because you were trying to kill him, I’d love to know the why behind that why. But you’re not going to tell me, are you?
I never said you didn’t love him.
Or maybe she just gets her kicks slowly sucking the life out of a guy and watching him suffer.
Yeah, he had it coming.
Or maybe she just got tired of being married. Didn’t want to admit to family and friends that the marriage that everyone thought was perfect wasn’t.
Yeah, Cameron, go back there. Well, it would be weird if we were all in the ladies’ room. [House leaves in the elevator.]
Thrilled to hear it.
It will.
He’s becoming more attractive by the minute, isn’t he?
Do I look pleased? [Cameron walks over to him, pulls a $20 from her waistband and hands it to him.]
I know. Saw the caller ID.
You answered?
I did. Those are new. Midnight snack. [he pops a vicodin]
Yeah. Actually it was after midnight. Today is your day, right?
No it's fine if you stay. [he opens the fridge and notices a bottle with the label "Property of James Wilson" which he promptly snags out and starts drinking from]
I said it's fine if you stay.
Maybe I just want to make sure you do your fair share around here.
What's weird about it? The girl with the allergies.
What are you doing?
You knew that I was interested, that gives you a valuable bargaining chip. Could have had me doing dishes for a week.
Heart transplant. The immune system's in the toilet, mommy builds her little angel a John Travolta quality bubble.
Six months without putting out, Dr Cuddy doesn't NEED to wear thong panties, but it's not our call.
It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.
Exercise allergy. Love it. What sort of exercise could a strapping young man and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly be--
Or the parents are lying about the room being clean.
Hasn't let me down yet. Re-check mom, dad, the girl, the boy, the room and the home.
Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on the night before the anaphylaxis, I don't buy that it's unrelated.
What's that mean?
Oh snap! What did he do to protect her, brillo-pad his privates?
Oh good work, assumptions are so much faster than actual questions.
[points with his cane] You the boyfriend? Need to borrow you.
Don't worry. I'll return him in roughly the same condition.
Did you take anything to stay healthy? Something stronger than an apple a day?
He's just tired. From being in a coma so long. What'd you take? Don't worry, he can keep a secret. [Dan keeps staring at the coma patient; House grabs his face and turns him to look at House] Antibiotics? Penicillin? Any of those names ring a bell?
This is the one downside of teenage sex. You're idiots. You almost killed your girlfriend. [Dan looks confused] She's allergic to penicillin.
Think lower, and more fun.
Totally, dude! There's this administrator here, whenever she gets sick she just gives me the prescription.
Yeah, 4 days later. By that time the penicillin was crusting up a sock in the bottom of your hamper.
No. Great part of being a grown-up, you never have to do anything.
What's the good news, what's the bad news? [he's writing on the whiteboard]
Is which?
Why?
New puzzle piece, always good news. What's the bad news?
[sighs] Seems that way.
And get cured by a mommy-wielded epi pen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?
What do you mean 'we'? I did! Guess I thought I did, maybe I didn't. Still, it was all me.
It is tempting!
[snatches the marker back] Sorry, there's a reason they call it the WHITEboard. It's not my rule. What ties both of these conditions together?
[taps his head] Right up here, buddy. [he turns on a light and slips on to the couch]
I didn't say it had to be with another person. [Wilson suddenly flinches away, extreme exasperation and a touch of horror to his expression] Can you think of anything that would tie together anaphylaxis and heart failure?
Now I need a lot of foreplay, and then there's the cuddling afterwards. [Wilson looks fed up and throws his briefcase on to the floor] Any way that anaphylaxis isn't anaphylaxis even if it responds to epi?
Have you seen the centre fold? There's no WAY those valves are real! Any chance that the heart failure could be unrelated to--
Lying's more fun.
Please have an answer to this question: what's for dinner? [he opens a package of some snack while Wilson walks into the kitchen]
You want one of these? I think I got a couple of blueberries... ohh... nope, sorry [he eats it] just one. [Wilson stands at the kitchen doorway and watches House while squeezing the bridge of his nose] Well don't look all weepy. If you've got a problem with me, deal with it! Short my sheets or something.
So... anaphylaxis, heart failure and paralysis. We couldn't put the first two together; I'm guessing we can't put all three together.
Can we put any two of those together?
Get an LP. And do PCRs for the viruses. And get an EMG to check for Guillain-Barre. Foreman's right, we've got to find out why she's paralysed. [the Ducklings stare] But not before staring at me dumbly for a few seconds. [Ducklings make their exit]
Nope.
Gotta pee.
He must be lying. [he hobbles towards the toilet, Wilson follows] You wouldn't want to live with a liar.
Yup! Decided I wanted you to stay. Told you that didn't I? [he continues talking to Wilson while he pees]
Yeah, and you're happy happy happy.
[flushes the toilet, hobbles to the sink to wash his hands] Do you know where my pee went?
Nope, came out of me and went right into the toilet. Now why would that be?
No, it's because there was no clear plastic wrap over the toilet. The stuff's in the kitchen, you have plenty of time. All that was missing was the WILL.
It could be.
So what? What did I do to you? I scammed you into doing the dishes, made you sit on the steps. I didn't kill your puppy. I did not make you miserable.
No... just makes me smile.
[takes a beer and pops off the lid] Right, but not tonight.
You're not going anywhere. You're going to sit on my couch, and depress us both because you just can't admit that it's over with your wife.
Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
You even called one? As long as you're here, it's just a fight. As soon as you get a place, then it's a divorce. Everything sucks. Might as well find something to smile about. [Wilson suddenly realises House's intentions all along, yay!]
[in his PJs] We're all dying. How fast?
[hobbling across his kitchen with a pot filled with water] Cuddy? What's she doing on this?
I don't blame them. I'll be right in. [he puts down the phone and puts the pot of water next to the couch, then proceeds to lift one of Wilson's hands and dips it into the pot of water]
This girl's tough. She gets what she wants. She's deprived of human contact; she gets herself a back door man. Or in her case, a side window boy. What else has she been deprived of?
The boyfriend brings the hot beef, he also brings a side dish. Botulism.
Not if the heart problem was really a paralytic problem.
Get me a rat.
What? We're not going to kill Steve! Only way to confirm this, we inject a rat with her blood, and wait for it to get all botulistic on your ass. In the meantime I'm going downstairs to browbeat the scared dying teenage girl until she... breaks down like a scared dying teenage girl.
[to Wilson] You're up early.
Yeah, I know. Fits perfectly. Unless this is the patient with the anaphylaxis, the heart failure, and the paralysis. In which case you're wasting your time.
Second? We've given you at least 8. Ok, well then here is 9. [he extubates Melinda] Botulism. Listen to me, have you eaten anything abnormal? Any canned foods?
You sure? Lying to your parents is usually the right thing to do, but there is an impending death exception. [he takes the bag and puts it over her mouth then pumps it to help her breathe]
You're right, she never lies. I was being rude. When your boyfriend snuck in on Friday night [turns around to the parents] - surprise! - perhaps he got you some sexy little treats, huh? Some honey or some edible underwears, massage oils, come on, anything.
Yeah, we know about the sex. [Melinda's eyes widen in shock] Turns out that Danny's little Danny is full of penicillin and that's what caused your anaphylactic shock.
[shocked] He said he was on penicillin.
If the antibiotics didn't cause the anaphylaxis...
Everything's connected.
Cameron said... [House and Foreman share a look, Foreman takes over pumping the bag to help Melinda breathe] When Dan came to your house that night, did he go through any tall grass?
Your daughter had 2 visitors on Friday night. One of them is still in the room. She has tick paralysis. Dan tracked a tick on to his jeans, which wouldn't be a problem but being a teenager, Dan couldn't keep his tick in his pants.
Now I'm checking her.
This girl's allergies are not ordinary.
Time course is perfect. Bite itself sets off an allergic reaction, venom takes 4 days to kick in, heart's vulnerable, hits that first. Then a day later, sets off the ascending paralysis.
They are until you find them! [he triumphantly holds up the comb...] oh no, that's dandruff. Okay well that wasn't nearly as dramatic as I'd hoped. It just means that next time it'll be even better.
That's the tick venom ascending.
She's just going to get worse. Ticks produce more toxins the longer they feed. She's going to be dead in an hour, even if you pump her heart full of jet fuel. Unless you let me find the tick.
Okay, just need one final instruction, when I find the tick on the autopsy, do you want to know? I'm thinking not, probably will make coping easier.
Sorry, a little crowded in here.
You're welcome to wait for the next one. [he takes back his cane and the doors start to close]
Well as long as we're stuck here, this might be a good time to look for that tick.
Just be a minute, honey.
Inject her again.
Temporary's fine, we're not hanging wallpaper.
It wasn't penicillin. You still think the symptoms are unconnected?
[shouting] You wake up in the morning, your paint's peeling, your curtains are gone, and the water's boiling. Which problem do you deal with first?
None of them! The building's on fire! We treat her symptoms, she dies, we find the cause, she lives. That tick is an IV drip of poison, we unhook it, she'll be fine.
Let’s get her gown up.
Left foot's clean.
It's here. Looks like a mole or a freckle, something we missed. Check the armpits.
Perinuem.
Maxilla.
Eyebrows, eardrums, pubic hair.
We haven't found the tick yet.
Hey, is that the first time you had sex? [she faints] With all the other stuff going on down there she might not have realised... [he starts checking her vagina for the tick]
See? I told you it'd be even more dramatic. [He's holding a tick... and its legs are still wriggling]
Push norepiniphrine, get her heart back to normal. She'll be completely cured by tomorrow.
Inamrinone was a stupid idea. Unless you wanted me to get that girl in the elevator.
Wouldn't respect you if you did.
Does that mean you're leaving?
You'll call anything.
You know that relative to their size, gorillas have smaller testicles than humans.
Reason is, primate teste size inversely corresponds to the fidelity of our females.
I'm talking about poker.
We're smaller and better than chimps, bigger and worse than gorillas. For all our rationality, our supposed trust and fealty to a higher power, our ability to create a system of rules and laws; our baser drives are more powerful than any of that. We want to control our emotions, but we can't. [Wilson looks tolerably annoyed] If we're happy, things don't annoy us. If on the other hand, we're sitting on crappy hold cards, little tiny things annoy us a whole lot more. [he puts the cigar back in his mouth and wags it up and down almost right in front of Wilson's face. Wilson seems to have a poker face on] I raise.
God that would be annoying.
They scan his head?
How's the heart rate?
[after a pause] I'm out. [he gets up to leave]
They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.
Follow my finger with your eyes. [Ian's eyes seem to follow the finger just fine]
Given the number of mojitos she's knocking back at the party, I'd say it's going to be at least 3 hours before she's even conscious.
[pops a vicodin] I don't drink. I want you to reach out and grab my cane. [Ian's hand reaches out way to the right of the cane and grabs thin air. He gradually corrects himself and grabs onto the cane after a couple more tries]
Your son's brain is losing control of his muscles.
She's wrong. [he gets up to leave]
I don't know.
[suddenly interrupts] Hey! How's that anal fissure? Did it heal yet or is it still draining? [looks at the woman] Oh, I'm sorry, didn't realise you'd come back for seconds. I figured that after the girl on the stairwell you'd be done for the night.
No Adam's apple, small hands. No surprises this time. [he smiles and nods in amusement]
Got a case.
Yeah if I didn't screw with you, you'd spend the whole night thinking you might get laid, which means you'd be useless. Better to extinguish all hope. Get Foreman and Cameron and meet me upstairs, stat.
Two cases, same symptoms. What do 6-yr-olds and 70-yr-olds have in common?
I already checked for that.
No no no.
No! The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle. What's weird is the kind of circle of life thing.
He will.
They were nowhere near each other in any of the four dimensions.
Yep.
She assigned it to me.
She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?
What were we talking about?
While you were all wearing your 'Frankie says Relax' T-shirts, I was treating a 73-yr-old woman who went through this progression of symptoms, the last of which was... [he leans down and writes DEATH at the bottom of all her symptoms] In case any of you missed that class in med school, that one's untreatable. Kid's got the first two. Took Esther an hour and 20 mins to go from two to three. And less than a day to make it all the way to the rear exit.
Great. Do a colonoscopy.
If you happen to find any purple papules, do me a favour and grab a slice. I want to check for Erdheim-Chester.
If Esther's family had let me to an autopsy, there'd be 201.
[walks in] So?
You mean papules. Come on Cameron, who's right? [she's looking into the microscope]
Let me see. [he checks] If it's not Erdheim-Chester...
[taking off his bowtie] Do a kidney biopsy. Esther's shut down in exactly-- [he checks his watch]
Geez. You get testy when you don't get any fuzz. Come on.
Urine.
Still think it's not the same case?
So, what can cause bloody diarrhea, ataxia and kidney failure?
Forget it. That battle's over. His rising creatinine is his kidney's way of saying go on without me. What explains everything?
Clear, concise, and completely plausible. And exactly what I did last time, didn't work. What else?
But not the purple papules.
42.
It's my lucky number.
She never showed any signs of... if he has lymphoma this far advanced, we should be able to see it in his blood and brain. Chase, run a blood smear and immuno-chemistries. Foreman get an MRI.
No you won't.
She'll come right up here and do one of two things - if she agrees with me, I don't need her, if she disagrees I don't want her.
Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy.
[puts his phone on speakerphone] Keep your answers short and discrete. Is Cuddy still playing?
Brilliant. She'll never suspect that Normandy is her target.
How's she doing?
Love to chat but got a game to play. How's she doing?
And what have you got?
[while on the phone, performs a trick to make a chip disappear, what a magician he is] Two hearts. You got the flush?
She drinking her seltzer?
Means she's bluffing. Push her all in. [Wilson does so]
Oh dear, sounds like I messed up. You're going to be stuck with her for a while. Talk to you soon. [puts down the phone]
Pituitary?
[walks to the board and starts writing, Chase enters] Pretty much confirms the lymphoma. Should have started Esther on prednisone.
[hopes shot down again, he takes his cane and wanders out of the room with the Ducklings in tow]
It's a train. We don't know what kind of train--
I'm thirsty.
[yanks his cane back and starts whacking the lock again until it does open and the gate rolls up out of the way] It's not now. We've got one advantage. We know where the tracks are going.
The fact that we know is an advantage. [he turns on the coffee machine and gets himself a cup] Which means we can get ahead of it. Next station is the liver. We've got about 90 minutes before it gets there. Maybe we can cut down a tree across the line just outside of town.
No, treatment will tell us more faster.
[angrily knocks back some stuff on the counter with a crash] Treat him for everything! Give him acetylcysteine and interferon and silymarine and whatever else you can think of to protect the liver.
Oh just catching up on some TV. How're you doing?
I heard. What've you got?
You're paired.
Nines?
Anything lower, you wouldn't sound so excited. Jacks are higher, your voice sounds like Debbie from accounting is sitting in your lap. Ask Cuddy if she can beat a pair of threes.
Yes, it would.
What did she do?
Enough with the codes, she obviously knows it's me.
Did she stop?
Go all in.
Just do it.
Shut up! Look, last time I wanted the game to go on. I still do. Means that this time you get to win.
Good.
Even better.
It's new. New is good. Because old ended in death.
He's back on Esther's path. We managed to make the train skip a few stations which means that instead of 12 hours, he's probably got less than two. Which begs the question why. What did we do?
Mess with them, not shut them down in 20 minutes.
Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?
What effects would interferon have on leukemia?
Four-year fellowship to learn that.
You hear that? She wants me off the phone, means she's vulnerable. Go all in.
Go all in.
Either you go all in or I tell everybody in the building that you wear toenail polish.
What happened?
Fine, keep playing, but I need you to recommend a good Oncologist because if I don't get one up here in the next few minutes, I got a dead 6-yr-old. [Wilson puts down the phone]
Games have a higher success rate.
No time.
What would move this fast?
Can anyone think of a reason why Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly? Other than it doesn't. [no reply] Nice.
Elevated. 98.
Is that like a dare or something?
Fine. We'll look for Kawasaki where he lives, Ian's coronary arteries.
It was a book?
12.
Only if you're on a wooden ship and your obsession is a whale. I think I'm in the clear.
You do realise that the point of metaphors is to scare people from doing things by telling them that something much scarier is going to happen than what will really happen? God I wish I had a metaphor to explain that better. Go back to the game. Don't worry, I'm not going to get eaten by witches. [he gets into the elevator and leaves Wilson standing alone]
Ian's younger. He can take more of a pounding. Esther died before the disease reached her heart. The disease made a mass and made it fast.
Kid can't take any more theories. Only thing we know is that whatever that mass is, that's what he's got. We need a piece of it. I'm doing a biopsy.
No let them watch, I do my best work on the big stage. Passing through the superior vena cava.
These procedures would be so much simpler if you could do them on healthy people. And out again. [as he's pulling the biopsy needle out, alarms start beeping] V fib!
[takes off Ian's robe] Come on, paddles! Come on.
Clear! [he shocks Ian, no effect]
And again. [shocks Ian, Chase checks for a pulse]
Again. [shock, check for pulse]
You got a clock on this?
Clear. [shock, check for pulse]
He's back. [he starts to finish taking out the biopsy needle which is still stuck where it was before Ian went into cardiac arrest]
Doing what we came here to do.
I know, I was right here. Give me a vacutainer.
Tell the parents. Where the hell is that vacutainer? [a nurse hands him one]
So, what's he got?
Good chance. I was talking about before that.
Things I can't do anything about, I try not to.
Whatever this is is very unlikely. Come on, more ideas, let's go people.
I don't know, it sure fits nice enough.
How's it going? You win?
I told them you'd signed off. The parents are mad because their kid is dying, that's understandable. But if he doesn't die, they won't be mad anymore.
I had to do it to save him.
He's not dead yet.
So, anything else or is it just these seven?
No she's not. You know she's not.
I'm surprised you didn't.
We don't need to go near him, we have his tumor. Cuddy may be right that we screwed up the protocol, she may be right about my screwed up obsession, but I'm right about the medicine. [he takes the tumor slice out of the fridge in a container and puts it in front of Cameron] How many tests can we do with that? [Cameron sighs] Look, we cure the kid we solve everybody's problems. How many?
How many okay pieces?
[turns around to look back at the whiteboard] Three tests, seven choices. Okay, what's first?
Yeah, so likely that Cuddy's going to think of that all on her own. She's got the kid's whole body to play with. Let her do that test. What's next?
Well there are more documented cases of histio amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis, let's start with that. [he circles it on the board, Ducklings exit]
Mr Foreman, you agree with both of them? Thanks for playing.
Then we don't have to think as hard. Taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically.
Tuberous sclerosis it is.
It's more likely, the test for it on the other hand, is less reliable.
Mighty Casey is down to his last strike.
Thanks a lot, didn't read that this weekend. [pops a vicodin]
Why?
Give me a minute.
You want me out of here?
No.
We can talk about it tomorrow.
Pocket aces.
[smiles indulgently, then suddenly realises something] The aces were hiding all along.
Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.
Disease lied.
Fine, it didn't lie, it slow played us. We biopsied the colon, it hadn't reached the GI tract yet. It's there now. It's in his liver, his lungs--
Run the test. [The ducklings look disappointed but do it anyway]
Wait, let me think about that. Don't pressure me. Just run the damn test.
That's a good start.
[walks away and stares at the wall] Take your time and say it loud.
Start the treatment. [Ducklings exit]
Yeah.
What I do, is not just based on the flip of a card.
It fit.
No, not just as easily.
[the piano music starts up again in the background, House smokes his cigar] You know, relative to it's size, the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal. [said with a poker face]
[jumps, startled from sleep, takes the Medical Journal off his face.]
Complicated case. I'm a night owl - Wilson's an early bird. We're different species.
Who'll clean the droppings from mine? [Rolls over, turning his back to her]
I'm guessing she's... what's the medical term? Upset. These 25-year-old females are usually completely rational. They're rocks. Really. [glances at the file momentarily] Eh... my theory seems to be supported by the fact that she swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Get her a shrink. And I need some shut-eye.
She's lying. Without REM sleep, your neurons stop regenerating - the brains shut down lobe by lobe. She'd be insane after five days - dead by ten.
Clever alibi.
[seems intrigued, takes the file from Cuddy]
[sits up properly and reads the file]
Got a case. It can wait, you two finish. [To Chase] Five bucks says someone loses an eye.
Fine. You're only putting off the inevitable. Twenty five year old female, hasn't slept for ten days.
I'm a very slow reader. No fever, no white count, means no infection.
No delusions.
I signed it, I didn't read it. [pauses] Aside from the sleeping pills, tox-screen was clean. No cocaine, meth, amphetamines, or diet pills.
Ahh.. about three weeks ago. Let's go back to the beginning.
Genesis. God said, let there be light.
I'm sensing another article.
[takes some vicodin out the pill bottle he had in his pocket and places it inside of a folded napkin]
But she sleeps.
[begins loudly crushing the vicodin folded inside of the napkin with the back handle of his cane] And she doesn't know she sleeps.
[unfolds the napkin and sprinkles the crushed vicodin over his food] So.. she sleeps, she just can't stay asleep.
You know what keeps me awake at night? Monsters in the closet.
Well, it's certainly not showing up on the scans. [pauses] Where's Cameron?
Oh, this is going to work out great.
[wipes his hands off on the napkin] Come on.
If you two guys can't play nice together, I'm taking away your toys. I don't care whose fault this is.
[interrupts her] I especially don't care if it's my fault. [pauses] Whatever this woman has, it's not showing up on our tests, which means she's sick... just not sick enough for us to see it.
Yes. I want to stress her body. Specifically her brain. Keep her awake.
So is cutting people with knives. But you can totally get away with that if you have a doctor coat on.
The more symptoms we can force out of her, the more tests we can do, the more tests we do, the more information we get, the quicker we make a diagnosis. [pauses] See how much more fun it is when you guys get along? [points to Cameron and Foreman] You two, take the first four hours.
What, all of you? [moves his feet off the table and sits in his chair properly] So the monster is peeking out from under the bed. Which either means she has a clotting disorder, or she has a tumor in her colon.
Who's keeping her awake now?
[stern] Who is with her?
Probably singing her lullabies. [pops open his vicodin bottle] I want her awake.
Why? Just because of the pain? [places the pill in his mouth] If you find a tumor in her colon, you can knock her out. If you don't - she stays awake.
When two people fight this much - you know what it means.
Oh, get a room.
Just pretend I'm not here. I'll be reading.
No. But I now have a much greater respect for whichever basketball player you dated in college.
What if the poison ivy wasn't poison ivy. She got the rash that was diagnosed as poison ivy around the same time the insomnia started. Rash plus nosebleed, plus sleep disturbance equals Wegener's Granulomatosis. Start corticosteroid treatment.
Much lower dosage. Get her back on the juice, triple the dose. Get a cianga, and an upper airway biopsy to confirm the wegener's.
[pulls up a chair with his cane] She said 'super depressed'?
[sighs] She wants birth control pills for her PMS.
Judging by the redness around your mom's nostrils and the tissue she's got conveniently stashed in her wristband, I'd say her problem is more likely a URI than a PMS.
Upper respiratory infection. A cold.
I also think she's got a problem with SAC.
[winks at her] Thanks for playing. Stupid American child. If you want the pill, all you have to do is walk into any health clinic in Jersey alone and ask for it.
What exactly was your plan? [clicks his pen and begins writing a prescription] You were going to exchange the birth control pills for some over the counter decongestants in the hopes that your mom's cold lasts another six years?
[pulls off the prescription paper and hands it over]
No. That's for your ovaries. I assume you haven't had a stroke, have you ever had a blood clot?
Super. In three months when you need a refill, take a bus to a free clinic. Don't wait around hoping for mom to get another sniffle. [stands upright once more, then leans closer to the Mandarin mother] Not the sharpest chopstick in the drawer, is she?
[shuts the exam room door] Nice idea, but no. This was just good old-fashioned laziness. I gotta hand it to Foreman though, he knew that you were a suck up and I don't give a crap. He successfully exploited us both.
Then I'd have Foreman pissed at me. And as annoying as you can be, at least I know you're not going to pop a cap in my ass. Witty, huh?
You on the other hand, continue to be flabbergasted every time someone actually acts like a human being. Foreman did what he did because it worked out best that way for him. That's what everyone does.
Was she sitting up or lying down?
Then it wasn't REM.
Did you start her on the steroids?
Then she wasn't sleeping.
Because we haven't done anything yet. She may be able to sleep with her eyes open, but unless you also discover that she's got two extra teats in the hooves of her feet, there's no way she'd be able to retain enough muscle tensity during REM sleep to sit upright. It's a movement disorder. Which rules out Wegener's. Where's Foreman?
Good.
Did she have a dog?
When?
When did she get rid of the dog?
Well then it's not allergies. She's just leaving her girlfriend.
If her birthday was a month ago, she would still be on steroids for the poison ivy. And those meds would have suppressed any reaction she might have had to the dog, which means she lied about being allergic. The dog's a commitment. You pretend to be allergic, because you don't want to tell your girlfriend that you're not planning on being around that long. So I think we can move onto options other than allergies.
She is not allergic.
Do a scratch test.
What about her mental state?
It just means I was right, doesn't mean she's suicidal.
Sleeping pills. God knows why she'd want them. What else can cause sleep disorder, and internal bleeding?
What are you doing here? Who's keeping her awake?
She's not getting a new liver unless we can figure out what's wrong with her.
So your advice is we just give up?
The girlfriend donated blood, right?
That means they're the same type.
Does seem tacky, doesn't it.
I'm Doctor House. I'm in charge of your case.
You're in acute liver failure. We can continue the transfusions and the lactulose. But it's only a stopgap. There's really nothing we can do to stop the toxins from building up in your bloodstream. Which means that in a few hours you will lapse into a coma. And you won't wake up. I'm sorry.
Well even with the right diagnosis, any treatment is going to take longer than the time she has left.
Wouldn't work without a diagnosis. Whatever killed the first liver will do the same to the second.
Well, it may give us an extra day or two, but, no procurement agency is going to let a liver go to a patient with an undiagnosed pre-existing---
It is medically possible for us to take a part of your---
[To Hannah] You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.
I just bought us 36 hours. Differential diagnosis - which monster eats your liver, screws up your sleep, and causes bleeding?
Didn't come up, so I guess, no.
And if you didn't have a pathological need to create a close personal relationship with every dying person you meet, we would be blissfully ignorant of any ethical dilemmas and might actually be able to concentrate on the differential.
No we don't. Continue.
It could explain the bleeding. Maybe the liver failure.
It's not medical information.
The AMA.
The rings don't have to be there if there's neurological symptoms.
Look, let's say you're right. We tell, she changes her mind, our patient dies. How is that moral? [pauses] What else?
Right. Skiers never party.
It's only moral to save a person if they love you? That's kind of a selfish way of looking at life. I like Wilson's disease, like cancer, love mushrooms.
So do those tests, and my tests at the same time. Use the PET to look for cancer, and Wilson's while you endoscope her bile ducts and scrape her stomach for mushroom spores. One of you CT her liver, While the other two check protein CA125, and CA19.5. Oh yeah, if anyone says anything to Max, they're fired.
We have to not. Because she's not our patient.
Need a little help.
27 year old female wants to donate half her liver to her dying girlfriend.
Liver failure.
The transplant buys me time.
It was her idea.
The donor and the donee sort of have opposing interests, right? Can't really advise them both.
Nothing medically relevant.
If I can't tell her, I can't really tell you, can I? And if you're advising her.
My patient's confidential file.
You can either satisfy your curiousity, or remain ignorant, do nothing ethically wrong and my patient doesn't die in three hours.
Seen it, digested it, watched it blow up my entire department.
I didn't read either.
Better than Foreman's?
The same old party lines.
Ah, shoulda, woulda, coulda.
No, I'm saying that I don't care what they do as long as my life isn't interrupted by pointless conversations like this one.
They shouldn't.
I could be the kindest gentlest boss in the world, and Foreman still would have done what he did because that's who he is. We can only hope that Cameron has learned something.
Our children are the future.
How's our patient?
I don't care about the prep, what about the diagnostic tests?
Where's Cameron?
Surgery is supposed to start in about 15 minutes.
Hannah and Max will be in the same room.
Both awake. With Cameron.
Good lord.
She hasn't slept in eleven days. Are you trying to torture her?
Ding ding, let's go.
I told you---
This is exactly why you got screwed with Foreman. You're looking for people to do the right thing.
Oh, she could have the best pre-frontal cortex in the history of mankind, but given the choice of life versus death, those bad bad people are going to choose life.
Yeah. I want to save her. I'm morally bankrupt.
Oh! I am so relieved you two are here. Without you looking at me, they're playing foosball down there.
Your patient is on the other side. Now get yourself upstairs and figure out what Hannah has or Max has risked her life for nothing.
Now, where were we before we were so rudely interrupted by the liver transplant?
And the initial tests were negative for cancer.
Any of them.
Great battles kick up a lot of dirt. Obscure the battlefields so the generals can't see what's going on.
Sound the retreat.
[Opens the door and moves inside.]
What?
[Promptly yanks his hand away. Looks intrigued, then places it back where it was.] Wh... how could you get them mixed up? They come in a little wheel, they don't look anything like decongestants.
No, you gave her the wrong pills.
I can count to ten and ask to go to the bathroom and 恭喜﹑你快當祖母了。[Gongxi, ni kuai dang zumu le. "Congratulations, you're going to be a grandmother."]
Okay, I'm going to leave you two alone now. I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about.
Is that supposed to surprise me?
Normal is not normal. She's been on steroids, transplant team gave her a cocktail of immuno-suppressants, she hasn't slept in over a week. Her white count should be in the tank.
Yeah, you might want to add some chicken soup. It's just as useless, but it's got chicken. We need to know exactly what kind of infection we're dealing with, what infection causes sleep disturbance, bleeding, movement disorder, organ failure, and abnormally normal white count.
Without conjunctivitis and elevated creatinine?
You sure she hasn't been out of the country?
You talked to the dog?
[scoffs] Has the dog been traveling?
Where?
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus. Do you see many cacti in Jersey?
Wanna see a magic trick? [moves his hand in and pinches Hannah's nose, pretending to steal her nose. He then shakes out his hand, feigning surprise as her 'nose' disappears] Oh no, where'd it go, where'd it go? [Raises Hannah's left arm up] Is it here? [searches it momentarily, then places it down again] How about here? [raises her right arm and pulls up her sleeve, revealing a large pustule wound] There it is. Oh, it doesn't look anything like a nose.
Give that to the lab, and call the CDC.
That we have a patient with the plague.
[nods] Looks that way.
Where there's dogs, there's fleas. If they hail from the southwest, then those fleas can't tell the difference between prairie dogs and puppy dogs. A small percentage of plague cases present with sleep disturbance. Imagine, an idyllic river of bacteria. Okay, it's not idyllic for her, but it serves my purposes. The steroids and the immuno-suppressants acted like a big hunk of dam across the river. Physics 101, put a dam up in front of a raging river, the river rises. By stopping the immuno-suppressants, we blew up the dam, and a hundred foot wall of bacteria flooded her lymph nodes.
After you restart the immuno-suppressants, then fill her up to the eyeballs with streptomycin, sulfate gentamycin, and tetracycline. Use a garden hose if you've got one. Get yourselves some prophylactic treatments as well.
Don't worry, it's treatable. Being a bitch though, nothing we can do about that.
Well if you wanted it, you shouldn't have left it behind when you moved out.
I'll call you as soon as I'm done with it. That's if you ever get a phone installed.
Won't be home Thursday.
I guess maybe I could bring in it tomorrow. After all, how many times can you hit pause at the part where Lindsay Lohan wins the spelling bee? What is it about girls who can spell?
What is it about girls who can count?
Gotta go, building full of sick people. [He walks into the elevator and peeps out.] If I hurry maybe I can avoid them.
God talks to him?
No, you talk to God you're religious, God talks to you you're psychotic.
God ever talked to you when you were in the seminary?
God's loss, our gain. He's either psychotic or a scam artist.
Well yeah, with the burning bush and all, it's quite the show.
God knows you stole Cameron's article?
Yeah. I can tell that from the Berlin wall of body language between you. [They are standing about a meter apart.] I'm shocked that he picked up on it. Low sodium - check for Addison's?
Cirrhosis?
[He sighs.] We should monitor his saline intake to correct the low sodium. No more than one mEq [Beta Comment: mEq = milliequivalent.] per litre per hour. Let's push the patient history to see if there's any history of drugs or other delusions. I'll take care of it. [He starts to walk out.]
God talks to him. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than God.
So, you're a faith healer. Or is that a pejorative? Do you prefer something like divine health management? [He closes the door and Boyd looks confused.] I thought God might have mentioned that I was coming.
Oh! That's a nice one, didn't even go with I see an 'H' and a medical coat.
Ah, don't believe them. I keep a sock in my pants. Faith - that's another word for ignorance isn't it? Never understood how people could be so proud of believing in something with no proof at all. Like that's an achievement.
Trust has to be earned; can't trust someone hiding in a closet.
You seem lucid, there's no confusion, no lethargy. What drugs have you been taking?
So aspirin and hospitals are ok. That's an interesting attitude for someone who's kept any number of people from getting medical help.
That bottle's been opened before. You refilled it at the water cooler.
How often do you do that?
I think water might have gotten in.
Is she dying?
[House leans to look at her around Wilson.] Before the end of this consult?
Patient, 15-yr-old, faith healer, hotline to God.
He is NOT a saint. He figures out what's going on in people's lives by watching, listening, deducing--
Then he passes on advice from God so he can watch them jump, it's a power trip.
I fear for the human race. A teenager claims to be the voice of God and people with advanced degrees are listening.
Massive cramps, low sodium, turns out he's been drinking water non-stop, God told him to purify his body.
Which would cause the cramping, yeah I get it.
Um hmm... he's all better. You know I get it if people were just looking for a way to fill the holes. But they WANT the holes; they wanna live in the holes. And they go nuts when someone else pours dirt in their holes. CLIMB OUT OF YOUR HOLES, PEOPLE!
Isn't it interesting that religious behavior is so close to being crazy we can't tell them apart?
Hmm... how to settle this? We could ask our patient to ask God, or we could MRI his brain. Which way do you want to go? 'cos I'm open to all of them.
His leash broke.
And now she's not freaked and angry, and you are.
Sudden drop in pain could create euphoria. You should let her have her vacation. [He takes a vicodin.]
Don't you guys have anything to do? [Ducklings leave.]
Your MRI results aren't done yet; go back to your room. No singing.
Your trick about the spat between Doctor Cameron and Doctor Foreman apparently impressed someone.
You like messing with people. That's why you're here now. Now maybe you think that your batteries are powered by God, maybe you don't. Either way, you enjoy what you do.
Hmm... but you make sure you're in the next state by the time the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back.
Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?
That's not fair. We were having fun; it's hard to keep sniping rationally when you throw a bomb like that in there. [He walks back into his office, Boyd follows.]
Forgive my enemies, never date a Taurus when Mercury's in retrograde, yeah, I learnt that one myself, the hard way.
See that is exactly the kind of brilliance that sounds deep, but you could say it about any person who doesn't pine for the social approval of everyone he meets, which you were cleverly able to deduce about me by not being a moron. Next time, tell God to be more specific.
Don't talk to my patient.
You get all huffy when my patient stumbles into yours in the hallway but you got no qualms about chatting my guy up.
God knows about my poker game.
Either that or I start going to Church every Sunday. That would mess with my bowling league.
Tuberous sclerosis.
All of them?
Tell our patient congratulations. Soon his chats with God will be a thing of the past. [He takes up the whiteboard marker and gives himself another point on the board.] Tie goes to the mortal.
I need you to talk to my patient. [He takes the yoghurt Wilson was going to buy from his hand.] I'll get this one.
Moses is refusing surgery. You have a gift, people thank you for telling them they're going to die.
You would let this kid die just to get into a stupid game?
Think God has a big mouth.
You think God needs a telephone in your head to talk to you? Isn't he everywhere? It's not a long-distance call.
How come everyone else needs faith but you just get the guy screaming his existence in your ear? [Wilson turns around to give him a look.] Your turn.
How sweet. You abdicate your authority; avoid those tricky parental issues like whether to let him drive at 16, just let him die at 15.
You have a gift for manipulation.
That's what I'm saying. You read that kid; you manipulated the hell out of him. [Wilson looks at House expectantly.] Bring pretzels.
I know that knock. Use your key, I'm not getting up.
Game's not 'til tomorrow night. Those aren't pretzels.
Yeah...?
[He stops playing and looks at the scan.] Don't tell my patient.
I want all the records on miracle woman. Every test, every treatment she's ever had, every question she's ever answered in this hospital. Anything sent for previous doctors. Go back to neo-natal if you have to- [He spots Grace with Boyd in his room. Chase looks like he's trying to sneak away.] Which part of keep them away from each other confused you?
Now we have obligingly offered medical proof that his delusions are true.
I'm on it. [Cuddy walks off.] Tell Jesus that we need another 24 hours to normalize the sodium levels.
Actually, tell Joseph. [He spots the dad walking to the room.] Jesus will know you're lying. And I want you and Foreman and Cameron to go over every line of every file on that woman.
The only way to save him is to prove that she is still dying.
Kings on nines. [The other players sigh, he collects his chips. Wilson walks in the door with a bag of pretzels.] Wilson! This is err... [He points to each one.] Dry Cleaner, Tax Accountant, Guy from the Bus Stop. This is Wilson.
Seniority.
Find anything?
All of them.
Everybody's a whiner. Be a do-er, not a me-tooer. [To the poker game.] Raise.
[The other guys look speculative, House looks wary.] Keep looking. [He disconnects and contemplates his position.] Fold.
This call had better be worth my time.
That's why you're there.
Unless you think he's radioactive...
Give me a minute [He puts the phone on the table to concentrate on the game and tosses some chips into the centre.]
9 bucks for a straight flush. [He gives Wilson a look and picks the phone up.] He's not coming home. Relax. [Disconnect.] There's nothing in this universe that can't be explained... eventually. Take this game. Only 2 people knew that you wanted in on it. I didn't tell him.
Why would you? No, the only person he's been getting all intimate and conversational with is your cancer chick. How would she know? [Wilson begins to look nervous.] The subject of my poker game isn't likely to come up in the course of a patient interview. No, that's the kind of thing you mention to someone you're used to sharing the details of your day with.
Your rabbi, guidance counselor, parent... she's not your mom, is she?
You've been having sex...
... with our miracle woman.
Most people in your situation just have their careers to worry about. You've got that and divine retribution.
Tell me how it happened, I'll tell them whatever you want.
So you offered?
Stay and make sure she's ok.
And never leave. You told me you got an apartment, but you moved in with her. You lied to me.
His name is not Wilson, and he's screwed up worse than I am.
Half the doctors who specialize in oncology turn into burnt-out cases, but you - you eat neediness.
You're a functional vampire. Sure, you're heroic, useful to society, but only because it feeds you.
There's nothing worth stealing so don't even look.
You don't just have a fetish for needy people, you marry them!
You mean it, and then time passes and suddenly they're not so needy anymore. Your fault. You've been there for them too much. They're getting healthy, independent, and that's just ugly. God you must be pissed at God right now for making her all happy.
Because you're being stupid. [Wilson laughs.] You know what you're risking by sleeping with a patient!
Yeah, you got me nailed.
He knows where I am.
[He answers.] Yeah. [A pause.] I'll be right there. [He puts down the phone.] Jesus is spiking a fever. He's delusional.
I know.
Pick any random guy off the street, bring him in here, examine him exhaustively and you'll find at least 3 things wrong with him. This kid has tuberous sclerosis - a mild case.
We assumed that the tumors were growing 'cos he's getting sicker, but he could have grown old and died and never known about them if he hadn't come here. We were looking for something; it's more or less in the right part of the brain. It's like we found someone standing over a dead body holding a gun. We arrested them, didn't look any further. Well sometimes, people really do just stumble into a murder scene.
Fevers don't come from a long-term underlying condition. He's a garden variety religious nut who happens to have an infection. It's lumbar puncture time.
Wilson, need you to do your thing.
I have faith.
Which antibiotics? We don't know what infection he's got.
Forget it; our best hope is your silver tongue.
Were you not paying attention when I was doing my murder scene metaphor?
It doesn't cause fever.
[He suddenly stops.] Or a bug he gave here. He gave it to your patient. That's why her tumor shrank; the virus went after the cancer first.
For 200 years, there've been reports of wild viruses that target tumors. Early 1900's, an Italian medical journal wrote up a woman with cervical cancer who was injected with a weak strain of rabies, I've no idea why they did that but her tumor shrank.
One of the virus types most prone to go after cancer cells is herpes.
They can't argue with the mark of Cain.
[Walking in.] Ok, let's start with the shirt. [Wilson walks in behind him.]
I'm on a mission from God. If you won't let me undress you, then strip.
That woman you helped? You gave her a virus.
Gift is jewelry, socks. What you have is herpes encephalitis. The only way you could have transmitted it is by scratching one of your own sores and touching another person.
Either that or cold sores. Your kid got it from the sex.
Herpes hides. You have an outbreak; it goes away, comes back, goes away. [He pushes Boyd back down once again.] Strip! Maybe you didn't have a sore when you came in but you've got one now.
Do you ever wonder why a perfect child of God should feel so desperate to purify his body that he needed to scarf down a dozen gallons of water a day?
Relax. A few Hail Mary's, a little acyclovir, he'll be picking up angels again in no time.
Come in.
You still hearing voices?
You're not going to give me my final point? [He starts taking off the outer shirt over his white t-shirt.]
Who else?
You don't think God should get a point knocked off?
Because of a virus! [He puts on his black leather jacket.]
She won the lottery.
Yeah, the hand of God reached into this kid's pants, made him have sex so he could scratch the rash, stick his fingers into some woman's face, give her a few extra months. Come on, he's just another liar and manipulator.
So... how's your girlfriend?
She didn't crash.
She still believes.
You're moving out? [They exit the hospital.]
You moving back in with me?
But we're ok?
Cop with a sense of humor. Differential diagnosis. [Tosses the files out to the team] Guy’s in the ER, bleeding on everybody.
Tox screen was clean. He did however get hit by a bullet. Just mentioning.
No, somebody threw it at him.
His name’s Baby Shoes, how bad can he be? [He motions to Cameron, and she gives him an x-ray and CT scan film that he puts up on the lighted board he just drug in.] The fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria. So let’s expand the search, factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.
Yeah, all ‘cause those bastards didn’t ratify Kyoto. Or he got CO indoors, and then moved outdoors before he’d inhaled enough to make him drop dead. Test his arterial blood gas. If his carboxyhemoglobin levels are higher then 15% stick him in a hyperbaric chamber. [Points to Foreman] You go check the cop car for gas leaks.
Well maybe she is, but just doesn’t have as good a sense of humor. Also check his personal car, his work, home, I’ll check the precinct.
[Bangs a vent with his cane] Sounds ok.
Looks great.
Your system’s fine. If you had a carbon monoxide leak half the force would be sick.
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
Yeah. [to the female cop] I’ve uh, I’ve got a disability. [Hands the cop lots of tickets]
A lot of emergencies. [She stares at him.] He’s feeling better now, but you never know.
Where does your partner sit?
Nope, waste of time.
I’ve heard rumors since junior high.
Legionnaires’ disease. It’s a good thing Joe got shot; the whole precinct would have gotten wiped out. Anarchy on the streets-
And only 2 seconds to recognize that the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an AC unit.
Pot doesn’t explain the fact that he’s gotten worse since he was admitted. Why don’t we agree to disagree. Actually, why don’t we agree that you’ll disagree with me while treating him for Legionnaires’? It’s not as pithy, but…[he walks off]
No chance this is a practical joke?
Bullet fragments just happened to hit the same spot in both lobes? Stroke could cause Anton’s blindness and euphoria. Officer Krupke is clotting in his brain. Start heparin to thin the blood. Find the clot and yank it out.
Great! Chase, stick your fingers in there, and grope around until you find it. Oh wait! When you turn him into a vegetable then there’s gonna be frivolous lawsuits. You know what would be better? Contrast MRI. Do we have one of those?
Well, let’s flip a coin. Heads MRI, tails he dies.
It’s just so cool that you know that!
Waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We’ll never get a decent view.
And a waste of time.
OH GOD…it’s a coup! Fine go do your angio. When you’re done wasting your time, come meet me down in the morgue.
What did the angio tell us?
I called my mom. She didn’t pick up. What did the angio tell us?
He’s a neurologist. Unless you think the patient’s optic nerve is in his spleen.
[Very sarcastic] Foreman, policemen are our friends. If you and I ever get separated shopping…
See! He was just busting the guy’s chops. Foreman is essential to solving this case. Medically, what did the angio tell us?
Saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there’s a traffic jam up ahead. Is it a ten-car pileup? Or just a really slow bus in the center lane, and if it is a bus is it a thrombotic bus, or an embolic bus? Think I pushed that metaphor too far. [While he is talking, he is pulling a corpse out of one freezer. He then walks over to the tray on the side.]
Oh, so you’re saying it was just a waste of time?
You don’t know that an MRI will kill him!
Little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They’re not going anywhere! [House puts in ear plugs]
Surgeons say inoperable, and the patient’s on blood thinners. Other than that, perfect plan. [Pulls a gun out of a plastic bag]
Much! [Shoots the corpse in the head, and then looks at the team…Cameron is trying to cover her ears, Chase looks like he’s going to run away screaming, and Foreman is grinning] Bullet’s identical to the one Baby Shoes popped Joe with. Let’s see how magnetic it is.
I shot him! He’s dead! [Sees that Foreman is still grinning, and looks at him funny]
Only used a half-load of gunpowder.
How unprofessional was Foreman?
Berated or humiliated?
One implies he took pleasure in it. I want to know if it was repressed black anger, or just giddiness.
I think that an appropriate response to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.
[Using the intercom] Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance! [He sees Chase struggling with the body in the background]
Well if I’d shot a live person, there’s a lot more paperwork.
The man donated his body to science! Yes, it’s a tragedy! If I hadn’t shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first year med students use the carpool lane.
You’re mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I’m doing now is taking it out.
My bad.
Well it doesn’t matter; we obviously can’t use it on this patient.
That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment. I’m sure not pulling my weight.
Echo his heart.
Clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be. Do a complete transthoracic echocardiogram. Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.
Did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain and had to have a hole drilled into his skull to relieve the pressure? Hilarious!
But not funny.
If you’re not sick, it’s not contagious and you’ve got nothing to worry about. If you are sick, the two of you are staying in here until we find out why. So you might want to make friends with the pig. [Foreman laughs] Good news is I can finally get my MRI.
Not the portable one, Chuckles. [Foreman stops laughing] Chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet riddled head.
To the office, got work to do. Eat your meals, take your temperature every half hour, and any meds I command you to take.
No! You get your own thermometer!
Check your blood, anyone with an elevated SED rate gets to be Foreman’s new roomie.
He’s a patient.
He’s not objective.
Right. You’re not even friends with him, why would you care? [Looks at the MRI which Chase has put on the light box] There’s an area of increased T-2 attenuation is the cingulate cortex.
Cingulate cortex control emotions. This mushy spot explains the euphoria. Question is, what’s causing the mush?
This is why he shouldn’t be here. You wouldn’t call him a jerk if he was here. If you think he screwed up at that apartment, you’d keep it to yourself.
Well we’ll never know; as long as he’s not here, he’s just like any other patient. Which means we can dump on him all we want. What’s eating the selfish jerk’s brain?
Test Foreman’s blood. Given that he’s the only one that got it, person to person transmission is less likely then some sort of deadly toxin that Foreman picked up at the guy’s home. Who wants to go next?
Whoa! You’re ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy that doesn’t consider you a friend?
Hey! You don’t have to go anywhere. Joe’s apartment is right downstairs in the lab. Foreman brought back samples of everything.
Don’t worry. You made the right call. Foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing, and he’s way smarter than you are.
What about the blood?
No one goes back to that place ‘til we know what we are looking for. Get some of that cop tape stick it over the doors and the windows.
Yeah, I was never that great a math, but next to nothing is… higher than nothing, right?
We should get a sample directly from Joe’s brain
Well I don’t think that this is the time to be pointing fingers. [He pauses] I didn’t give Foreman any.
Come on, really, who doesn’t?
Without a fever, not a chance.
He also had Legionella.
This is a waste of time. [He begins to walk to leave the room]
If I’m gonna be arguing with Foreman, I may as well do it directly. [Turns around and walks out. Chase turns to look at Cameron.]
[Hits his cane on the window, gaining Foreman’s attention] Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.
You’re not laughing anymore.
[Gives his typical “House Snark Unsure” face] Sort of doubt it. Staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver or kidneys before it gets to your brain. Your organs are clear. It’s not staph.
Which I would’ve seen in your MRI [Sets down the cane and pulls out a paper from his jacket] Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain. [Puts the paper in the drawer for Foreman to retrieve it]
There was no abscess on the image.
[Furrows his eyebrows and smirks] I liked you better when you were jolly. [walks over and gets the MRI, placing it on the window for Foreman to look at it.]
If it was staph you would have a fever, which you don’t!
[Looks at it quizzically] What idiot gave you that?
Tell me your date of birth.
Because my neurologist is having surgery!
You didn’t believe that crap did you? [Continues doing the procedure] Date of birth.
Oops! Did you say Ommaya? I could have sworn you said biopsy. Hey, I’m just messing with your head. Mother’s maiden name, please.
Still dying. [House continues to play with the ball and doing it with precision]
That’s it?
Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too.
No. Go back to the lab. Start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.
Everything. Bacteria, toxins, fungus, anything that likes to feast on brain.
Then Hurry! Cameron, suit up. You’re gonna monitor Foreman. He’s on to hand contractures; he’ll be on Anton's blindness soon. Run hourly checks because when he does go blind he won’t be able to tell us. We’ll use the data to construct a timeline so we’ll see how far behind Joe he is.
Why are you still here?
[turns around angrily and interrupts Wilson] How many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients? Let me know when that happens. Then we can have this conversation.
I’ll bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without even catching a damn thing. Boy, I wish I had your job. [Turns around]
Where’s Cameron?
Imagine being constantly reminded of the pain you’re about to be in.
So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy. Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.
I’m certainly not going in there to stop him.
Joe has a new symptom: hyperalgesia.
The infection is spreading into the pain center of the brain.
Suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
Did you find any cedar wood anywhere?
Maybe what? [looks at Foreman] Maybe somebody can go back and take a second look? And why aren’t you pissed off that Cameron’s playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
[sitting on a chair in the hallway] Why doesn’t anyone listen to me anymore?
God, you’re weak. Guy steals your article, tells you you’re not his friend. You still wanna risk your life for him.
Wow.
God, you’re weak. [Cameron rolls her eyes] Guy tried to kill you. First thing on my list of things do would be to stab him back. Shoot him. I’ve got a gun in my desk. Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and give the bastard everything he wanted.
Ehh….[bounces head back and forth] Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim. That’s why you’re wearing the suit. You wanted to be here. He just gave you the excuse. What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
Give me the bag. [grabs something out] Mildewed dishtowel.
What is that, mouse droppings?
Now that I recognize as oven crud.
What’s with rye bread?
Three loaves.
[goes silent for a moment, thinking] You’re going back in there.
[talking to Cameron] Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye. That’s looking too far into the future unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
You on the roof yet?
Whistle or something. [Cut to House looking outside] Do that come hither thing.
They came that fast because it’s their behavior pattern. Joe’s been feeding them. Now look down, you see a river of pigeon turd?
It’s not weird, it’s cheap. Joe’s the guy who looks for the easy way.
Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors. Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings? You see a shovel or a dustpan?
Bucket full of pigeon crap. Perfect home for Cryptococcus neoformans.
Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness and intractable pain. Let’s hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson: don’t cut corners when you’re growing your pot. See you back home.
Foreman. Foreman! Time of death.
Time of death. 12:26 p.m.
Cop with a sense of humor.  You [pointing at Foreman] check the cop car.  Also check his personal car, work, home…. [Shot of Joe screaming, Foreman laughing.]
Time of death, 12:26 PM.]
I need a bone saw.
You said you would --
I just want a little tiny slice of this guy’s brain, that’s all I need, just enough to tell me what’s killing Foreman.
It’s not a good idea to scream “fire” every time someone lights a match.
[shivering] Oooh.  Level 3.  We should call Jack Bauer.
Well, tell them we’ll be really, really careful.
Whatever.  The point is, we’ll be lucky to get results in three days.
-- and they told you…
Ah, that’s a shame, because Foreman will never get a chance to know what it was, because he’ll be dead in 36 hours.  Maybe this is a toxin; maybe it’s not contagious at all.  You’re killing Foreman because of a “maybe.”
Foreman, c’mere, fast.  [He sends a hammer and pick through the window.]
You’re doing it.  Now.  Ever study how they used to do ice-pick lobotomies?
Shove an ice-pick into the eye socket just above the tear duct.  Bang it a couple of times with the hammer, get a sample.
Can’t do the time if you’re not alive.
Take your time, guys!  Just tell them to go slow; it won’t be your fault.
Which is why we need to chop into the guy’s head.
Not to you, Foreman.
Yeah?  You have the answer?  [He sees the guys almost suited up.]  Foreman, do it now!
What are you doing?
He thinks he can see, same as the cop.
Forget it.  You just biopsied a mattress.
Apparently I was optimistic about the 36 hours.  Intractable, unbearable pain is up next.  Sure you don’t want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing?
If it was meningitis, we’d all be sick.
LP’s pointless.  We already did a brain biopsy, it was negative.  [Quick shot of said biopsy.]
How do we know you’re not sick?
Never.  [Chase guffaws.]
Well, let’s assume it’s not blood-borne.  If you start cracking jokes we can reassess.  In the meantime, stay away from people and animals that you care about.  [Quick shot of Foreman’s empty chair.]
Start treatment.
Treatment for everything – likely or unlikely.  If you can think of it, treat for it.
Of course there’s a better way!  It’s that body sitting in the room with him that Cuddy won’t let us touch!  Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals, parasites – it’s got to be one of them.
To see if I can find another brain to biopsy.
[in a hazmat suit on a hands-free phone]  I’m at the cop’s place.  You have to retrace your steps.
[taking out Steve] Where did you start your search?
You’re going to tell me everything you did, everything you touched.  If you went to the john I want to know when and why.
What next?
Wait for Steve McQueen to get giddy.
Cuddy’s shower.  Are you a fan of the Brazilian?  I, hmm…
Well, obviously I couldn’t bring him here.  He’s been exposed to whatever Foreman’s got.
Because I needed one with a clean medical history.  Who knows what kind of antibiotics they gave those rats.
Eh, it shouldn’t take long.  Got the AC blasting, I soaked the floor of his cage…. [Wilson looks fairly disgusted.] As soon as he gets sick, I do an autopsy.
Right after he gets sick, there’s a good chance he’ll get hit in the head with a cane-shaped object.
First symptom is euphoria.
He doesn’t usually climb on his water bottle like that, does he?
She responsive?
Big word.  Someone’s been on the interweb.
Well, let’s confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back.  Strobing lights and high pitched sounds can provoke a seizure.  [quickly moving a penlight in front of her eyes] Woooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Takes one to know one, loser!  Wait, that means I’m a loser.  Scratch that.  These episodes, she gets sweaty afterwards?
She seem upset by them or just tired?
You mix rocking, grunting, sweating, and dystonia with concerned parents and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy.  In actuality, all your little girl is doing is saying “yoo hoo” to the hoo-hoo.
Marching the penguin.  Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.  Finding Nemo.  [The little girl thinks all of these euphemisms are hilarious.]
It’s called gratification disorder.  Sort of a misnomer – if one was unable to gratify oneself…that would be a disorder.
I was trying to be discreet – there’s a child in the room!
Epilepsy is horrifying.  Teach your girl about privacy and she’ll be fine.  [hands the girl a lollipop]  Here you go.
You’re upset that I’m doing clinic hours?  Wow, that is so like rain on your wedding day.
Yeah, how’s that going, by the way?
Tough to do an autopsy when they haven’t even picked up the body.
I go watch the meds drip into his IV, you think that’ll make the treatment work faster?
Feeling guilty?  It’s not too late to change your mind.  Go call the CDC, tell them you were just joshin’.
The question is, which treatment?
I don’t care if you do it alphabetically.  Just stay on top of his vision – first sign of regression means we’ve taken him off the wrong one.  [Chase enters.]
Philosophical question: how do you want to die?
Your choice is currently between four hours from now and fourteen hours from now, so I’m assuming that means you want the latter.
The meds are curing what’s in your head but they’re trashing your pancreas.  That’s why you’re puking and you can’t stand up without screaming.
Think you can handle a life without a pancreas?  We keep you on these meds, you’ll spend the last four hours of your life being able to see.  Take you off, you’ll go blind again, but it’ll give us time to figure out what’s eating your brain.
Yeah, you two can get caught up later.  Sir, I need you to come with me.
He’s not a what, he’s a who.  They even have the right to vote now.  Rodney Foreman, Cuddy.  Cuddy, Rodney Foreman. [Cuddy and Rodney shake hands.]
This is Foreman’s dad.
Dr. Cuddy here is the Dean of Medicine.  Remember that cool autopsy I was telling you about, the one that would save your son’s life – she’s the one who can give us the green light to do it.
Won’t be soon enough.
Oh, don’t blame the rules.  Don’t hang this on policy and protocol.
They’ve got the cop’s body in a locked, airtight bag.
He hasn’t gotten up to pee in hours, he’s due.
He wouldn’t eat the donut.
No.  I had to pee a couple times.
Given that it is her fault, it seems appropriate.
The only thing I can do is think.  You can pretty much do that anywhere.  As long as no one’s bugging me.
Good!  It’s an anomaly, anomalies tell us things.  Why would this go faster in Foreman, what’s different?
Right!  We were wasting all this time looking for an unknown disease, we should be looking for a different strain of an unknown disease!
What?  How long have you been sitting on this information?
Check everything.  Bacterials, fungals, toxins, parasites – look for anything with a documented racial disparity.  [House looks at Steve’s webcam.]  Wait.
No.  He’s completely healthy.  Maybe that’s the difference between Foreman and the cop.
You’re dying too fast.
Hey, Cuddy.  Having a nice visit?
[tries to speak with a vial in his mouth] Legion – [takes the vial out] Legionella pneumophila.
Foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection.  Our cop wasn’t, he had Legionnaire’s Disease.  Our cop didn’t turn into brain food until we cured the legionella.  Legionella slowed down the disease.
No idea.  Just know that it did.
You gonna tattle to the CDC?
If I put you under I can’t monitor your pain.  If I can’t monitor your pain I can’t tell if the legionella’s working.
Hmmm, wish there could have been a puff of smoke or something.  Would have been much more dramatic.  Keep your slippers on, wouldn’t want you to cut your foot.
Yeah.
But not great.  It didn’t fix anything, it just slowed it down.  The whole point was to give Steve a little more time to get sick.
Brilliant.
Cameron, what kind of illnesses affect humans but not rats?
Because I’m sure you spent the first twelve years of your life dreaming of being a vet.  The rat is not getting sick.  Cameron is not getting sick.
It’s okay.  It’s not your fault.  Presumably you’re still healthy because whatever it is is not blood borne.  Steve has no excuse; he did everything that Foreman did.
And what infections could he be positive for but test negative for?  When we test for infections, we look for antibodies.  [Cue the CGI graphics!]  Now, what if the patient is infected, but has no antibodies – what if the body is not fighting the infection?
Neh, eh, I asked first.  Let’s start with the ‘what’, we’ll deal with the ‘why’ later.
Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman.  And what if the patient was then exposed to a second infection, like legionella?  The body would recognize that infection, increase the white count, send in the troops to start fighting, and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire.  So the question becomes, what type of bacterial infection affects humans and not rats, and the human body would be unlikely to recognize.
The answer is listeria.  I’m starting you on amp and gent. [Transcriber’s note: that’s ampicillin and gentamicin, two antibiotics.]
And the fact that Legionnaire’s is helping you.
Yeah.
Stop asking me questions based on the premise that I’m wrong.   The antibiotics are in the airlock.
 Absolutely.  Don’t blame you.  The world is such a complicated place if you’ve got higher reasoning skills.  I’m often jealous of smaller animals and retarded children.  Take the antibiotics.
One slip, you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth.
Sure, I make it look oh-so-sexy.  It’s actually not as glamorous as you may think.
The antibiotics could do the same thing!
We try it, we see!
Pain makes us make bad decisions.  Fear of pain is almost as big a motivator.  Now look, we still have time.  I will do that biopsy if I have to, but not a moment before.  [Foreman takes the pills.]
Start Foreman on IV antibiotics.  Where’s his dad?
He’s not with him.
I’ve started your son on a new course of treatment.  If it works, he’ll get better.  If it doesn’t, he won’t.  While he’s not getting better, he’s going to experience so much pain that we’ll have to put him in a chemically-induced coma while we figure out what to do next.
It’s a pet name.  I call him Dr. Bling.
When your son is in a coma you’re the one who’s going to have to make the medical decisions for him.
You don’t care what I do?
Any improvements?
Like what?
Give the antibiotics more time.
So he’s almost in unbearable pain, he’s not almost dead, which means we have more time.
I hang out in the basement, you rag on me.  I stay in my office, you rag on me.  Honky just can’t buy a break.
Based on the cop’s progression I figure he’s got another four hours before –
No.  Cutting open his head is what’s dangerous.
I know you –
Not unless you people can’t come up with something clever in the next three hours.
Well, who died and made you boss?
He’s out of his mind!  Yesterday he was giggling about a hole in a guy’s head.
You’re sorry?  You’re talking about this man’s son.  You’re denying him the right to be a part of –
That was great!
Yeah.
Give me time.
An hour.
His O2 stats are at 94 right now.  As long as they’re above 90 the danger of fatal arrhythmia doesn’t increase.
You were right.  We should be cutting into a corpse’s head.
There’s got to be other bodies.
No, that apartment was a dump.  Just because Steve McQueen didn’t get sick doesn’t mean some other varmint didn’t.  You give me an hour, I go back there and find a dead animal, we cut its head open instead of Foreman’s.
Either you’ll find the answer, or I’ll find the answer.  Doesn’t matter.
Found a blind bird.
I’ll know in about 30 seconds.  [House corners the bird, but it flies off.  He then finds a dripping and rusty pipe.  Again, the cell rings.]
I screwed up.
That’s not what I meant.  I screwed up the first time through this place.
It’s not where, it’s when.  He came here in the early afternoon.  Me and Steve came two hours too late, you came six hours too early.  It’s the water, the irrigation system only pumps –
We tested the wrong water.  He stole cable, he stole fertilizer, and he stole water.  [looking at it under a microscope]  It’s riddled with Naegleria.
You already did the biopsy?
Up and at ‘em.
Keep your head still and follow my finger.
Your breath stinks, you’re peeing into a bag.  What are our names?
Names.
You remembered.
Wiggle your left toes.
Your left toes, Foreman.
No, you didn’t.
He can move them.  Raise your right arm.  [Foreman raises his left.  Whoops.]
Tonight. L Word marathon.
On mute.
Still sucking up so she'll fund your play space for the chemo kids? They really ought to save their energy for other things. Like crying.
She asked you?
Doesn't make sense. Unless she ran out of batteries.
You're too nice for her to like you; she's not needy enough for you to like her. She's got an agenda, just not one that includes an appearance by 'little Jimmy'. I'll poll my peeps. [He goes into the conference room] How many of you think that Cuddy asked-- [only Cameron is there] or rather peep.
Unless Chase broke his neck falling off his polo pony, he had no reason to be in the ER.
Seizures are cool to watch, boring to diagnose. What about Foreman? He needs to get his malingering butt back here.
Glad you're back. Cameron makes lousy coffee. Take mine black, the way I take my brain-damaged neurologists.
Tell her everything is great. Neither of us wants to deal with her guilt.
Of course not, hell if people felt guilt every time they accidentally lobotomised a guy...
Yeah, your heart was in the right place. [Foreman can't seem to figure out how to open a packet of coffee] It's just his brain that's not quite where it's supposed to be. [he grabs the packet out of Foreman's hands and tears it open with his teeth] Tell her everything's great.
Yeah, might pull a muscle.
Still bored. Tell her why.
Well done. But until you can remember how to make coffee, hands off the patients.
Can we focus on the task at hand? Why did mommy twitch so hard she tossed the baby in with the bathwater?
Of course I need you, we're a team.
You're a moron; did you even look at the file? Kidney functions fine.
What?
Test her. [she walks out] Cameron thinks it starts with a "w"; I'm thinking "v".
Think you can do a strep throat culture without the swab ending up in the guy's poop chute?
Gotta be my guess.
Do a digital subtraction angiogram. Foreman can't tell up from down and Cameron's a girl - all that mechanical stuff.
You're late. [he's lounging on the sofa next to the door and seems to have been there for quite some time]
What you got there? Special panties for your date with Wilson?
It's not a date, it is business. And if it was business, you wouldn't say it was none of my business.
I want to talk about your date with Wilson.
This is fun. Spring Chase from NICU and I'll shut up about your date.
Have you suddenly lost the ability to lie? Nobody's quit NICU in two years. And if you're making up reasons, that means there is no reason. Which means he asked for the assignment, didn't he?
Absolutely.
So what causes seizures, hypercalcemia and the thing where mommy bends like Gumby?
Oh oh, baby's lungs are going to conk out any minute. Probably want to deal with that.
Multi-task.
Let the indulging commence.
Lithium doesn't show on a basic tox screen, scarecrow.
Rare complications of a rare blood cancer. You're not totally hopeless. Get an S-pep and an MRI for the myelogenous meningitis [to Cameron]. Search the patient's place for lithium [to Foreman]. Baby's lung problem is bacterial, not chemical, start ECMO [to Chase]. While you're searching for the lithium, take a water sample and check the pipes. You want me to write this down for you? [back to Chase] I ask you, is almost dying, any excuse for not being fun?
Why don't you want to work for me? I'm nice, I'm fun at parties.
Not to me. X-ray was too consolidated. So why are you down here? Hoping to expand your make out pool to include the preme to nine-year-old demographic?
What a complete load of crap. What am I a nurse you're trying to prep with this vulnerability thing?
You don't start him on ECMO and that infection could rampage through his body like pistons fans after a championship. But you do it your way. Nothing more honest than a dead baby [he gets into the lift]
Not anymore. Paid good money for it. [he finally finds the empty box that Cuddy was trying to hide that morning] Look at what she bought.
What is red clover used for, Dr Wilson?
She doesn't wheeze, flake or ache. And she didn't ask a pulmonologist or a dermatologist for dinner. She invited an oncologist. It's not a date, it's a consult.
Fascinating, call me when we have--
So why is our patient bleeding into her brain?
She's bleeding because she's not clotting. So why is she not clotting? [Foreman is in the room] What'd you bring us, daddy?
You don't remember? She bled all over you this morning [Foreman looks confused and a little distressed that House is suggesting something he can't remember]. Kidding. Idiots are fun; no wonder every village wants one.
Hey, it was your idea. Now it's even better. Mommy quits, she gets the DTs, it even explains the seizure.
Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.
Where are you going?
What if I'm wrong? What if daddy's the drunk?
I want him to argue his point!
What's that saying where you ASSume you become a pain in the ass to me?
Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon farm!
I need him to react; I need him to act like a human being. I need him to get over this boring, near-death rebirth.
Nearly dying changes everything forever. For about 2 months. 2 months is too long, I need the guy I hired back now.
Waste of time; put her in a coma before the DTs kill her.
It wasn't hard considering my other choice was your stupid psych theory. [he reaches for his vicodin] Which was not stupid. I'm telling you, I'm going to drop the "N" bomb if I have to.
Did they change the name?
[notices the empty baby crib at the end of Kara's bed] Where's the baby? [he throws his cane away and quickly runs (as well as a crippled man can at any rate) into Kara's room, Foreman hot on his heels]
No breath sounds, crash cart and epi, stat! [he starts giving the baby mouth-to-mouth] I told you your psych theory wasn't stupid.
Hey, take it easy on Foreman. He's playing with one lobe tied behind his back.
You know what else might be a trigger? A physical illness. It's a wild idea, I know especially since she doesn't have any obviously physical symptoms like internal bleeding or excess calcium.
Ahhhh!! Jesus! You've done it again! Will you argue with me?! Drinkers don't eat right, explains the bleeding and the calcium, this might just be some crazy drunk and I'm telling you that she's about to die of myelogenous meningitis.
Exactly! It's an insane idea!
Have an original thought. In the meantime, stress her into having another seizure.
You also can't because it's dangerous and highly unethical, therefore, if you get caught, pretend you can't make coffee, mental defectives get tons of slack. [he sighs] Take her off the Haloperidol, hook her up to an EEG, flash some lights, make her pant, shoot her up with a placebo. When she starts twitching, if the machine twitches along its real. If not, call the cops because she's a psycho killer.
Stop protecting him.
Not if he wants to get better.
Well then I need a new neurologist.
Well if he got killed doing his job I wouldn't keep him on the payroll. I don't care how guilty you feel, or how touched you are by his reborn spirit.
Then you're guilt-ridden.
Then you're pathetic!
You're right, should stick around, make sure he doesn't screw up.
How was dinner?
She lost her nerve.
What are you doing?
You're doing it yourself, in the middle of the night? On a spoon. Cuddy's spoon?
Yeah. I do that after all my dates too. People think you're the nice one.
You go first. You desperately want this to be a date.
Just admit that you like her. She's smart, funny, got a zesty bod. I think it's great you can look beyond the fact she's the devil.
She's my boss. She gets sick, the hospital might replace her, especially if she dies. I'd have to learn how to manipulate someone new.
Find me when the results come in.
Hmm... a genuine physiological illness that rules out a few things. Like what I wonder?
Thing about being a good loser, you're still a loser.
Since it's progressing, we can assume it's progressive. Which means it won't be long before the brain closes shop altogether. Ideas?
Chase shouldn't be wasting his time in the NICU.
No, treatment for Wernicke's is thiamine; we gave her that together with the vino.
She had to be smuggling it in to be getting sicker.
Ideas are not soda cans, recycling sucks. Give me something new and shiny. Or go retro, take an old idea, shine it up, add a new symptom... encephalopathic delirium. Pellagra.
He agrees with me, what a shock.
So... what causes pellagra and crimson spew? [he bangs his cane on the glass wall in front of Chase, shocking him out of his mindless staring] Dead baby, while sad, not our problem.
You killed him, if you don't get over it, you're going to kill momma too.
[looks at Chase who is still despondent] Chase, would you get your head out of the dead baby's butt and focus on the barely alive-- [he suddenly realises something] How much polystyrene did you give the kid?
I need your son.
Your wife's doctor. Your son may have had the same condition she does.
If I biopsy her intestines, she'll bleed out. He obviously won't.
Ok. How about trading him for a beer? Or maybe you're more of a whiskey guy. You didn't have strep or stomach bug the morning you came in, you puked because you were hung over. If she was a recovering drunk and slipping most of the time, you'd be right.
People are going to feel sorry for you; they'll tell you that you can't anticipate the unthinkable well the fact is you can. It's just not all that pleasant.
I know that people don't get crazy enough to kill someone without first being crazy enough for someone to notice. How many times did you go out for a drink because she was crying? How many times did you stay at work because you couldn't listen to her telling you what a bad mother she is? You were relieved. When she shut down. She just sat staring for hours at a time. She held the pillow over his head; you slept while she went nuts. Not exactly a draw but--
Let me do the test. It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.
Got a dead baby for you to autopsy.
Love working NICU? I can get you transferred.
You don't give a crap about patients. [Chase looks fed up and is about to walk out of the room] Your paycheck. [he holds it up out of the pile on his desk] You've been double-dipping. Taking your vacation time here while drawing a salary in NICU. Strange - rich boy doing all that for some extra cash.
But your dad was; now he's dead. If you're not rich that means that daddy cut you out. [he gives Chase the envelope]
Don't let it change you. And do the test.
He was being treated with polystyrene.
It didn't. Question is what do they use in the NICU to bind it together?
It's great stuff. Unless your body can't tolerate it.
Just like mom. Celiac can be triggered by all kinds of stress. Bills, childbirth, drunk husband. Every time she had a bowl of pasta or a slice of bread a slosh of soya sauce, her small intestine became more damaged, [CGI of the small intestines and the villi] less able to absorb the vitamins and minerals in her bloodstream. Her body couldn't absorb enough niacin, caused the pellagra. Didn't absorb vitamin K, caused the bleeding. And celiac is why the baby's meds didn't work. His body just couldn't absorb them. Switch mom to IV nutrition, its gluten free, that'll spruce her villi right up.
[to Wilson] Tell them what causes excess calcium. With a chaser of bloody vomit.
Well, she's your patient now. [he looks back at the sheet Wilson gave him with the results of Cuddy's PCR test] And it wasn't a date.
You don't have cancer.
You have no proof of that. I on the other hand, have this. [he hands her the results sheet]
Hey, it's good news.
Deal with it on your own time. Bad news, oestrogen is too high.
Not this much, not for at least for another week. That's when you ovulate.
Once a month, when you leave the kids cancer ward, your eyes glisten. About three days later, you break your ban on sugar and chow down a bucket of frozen yoghurt in the cafeteria, sprinkles included. Based on the last yoghurt sighting, you've got another week before you ovulate. You're on fertility meds. With red clover as an herbal booster. [Cuddy starts to look upset] And the dinner with Wilson was an audition. It's too bad he didn't land the gig. He would have had fun.
So... when's our "dinner"? [with accompanying hand gestures]
Oh he's going to be so disappointed.
Is it my turn to say something obvious now? Oh I know, you were insane.
Yeah, like diabetics choose to not produce insulin. Listen, someone got sick, someone died. Happens every day. The only difference in this case is it wasn't the same someone.
Spoken like a true sane person. This is not your fault. You're healthy now... except for the cancer.
You do not deserve to die.
She said no.
She was unstable, now she's sane. She's entitled to refuse treatment.
Fine, go on in there and tell her that every day is a blessing! So you killed your baby, shake it off, think positive! At least you're alive. [he waits for a response] Hmm. Kinda hard to sell when you don't believe it huh? And you never believed it. You just wanted all that crap you went through to mean something, well it didn't mean anything, it never does. Welcome back.
You were aspiring to be content.
Yeah, if we're all just satisfied with what we have, what a beautiful world it would be. We'd all slowly starve to death in our own filth, but at least we'd be happy. Listen, I need your self-worth to hang on this job. I need you kicking ass here to be all that lets you rise above being miserable, if waking up in the morning is enough, I don't need you.
No you can't. Not anymore.
Hi.
Bye.
Yeah.
It wasn't a date. [Wilson narrows his eyes] Turned out she had some skin lesions, guess there was no genetic predisposition. [Wilson looks a little suspicious but lets it pass]
All on the top page.  I’m a real good reader.  Personal chart handoff means there’s something else.  I’m hoping it’s not personal.
No problem.
Do I know you?
Doesn’t ring a bell.
Unless you mean Dylan Crandall, the man who’ll believe anything.  See, I just made you believe that I….
Yeah, pulled a hamstring playing Twister.  Just gonna walk it off.  So, who’s the girl?
No, I said I’d give my right hand to have his left.  Why is she with you?
Wow.
Hmmm… yeah.  She looks just like you.  [Best to point out now that Crandall is white and Leona is black.]  Got the same ‘fro.
Yeah, that’s how babies are made.
That’s unbelievable.
Seriously, I don’t believe it.
You’re a sucker.  You always were.
Why wouldn’t I?  She’s not scamming me.
ER said no.  Retest.
ER said no.  Retest, and read the damn file.
It’s all a ‘no.’ Everything about her heart is healthy.
It’s better than Crandall.  He’s a Katrina victim victim.
What if her heart is like my bike?  Runs like crap when I’m by myself, but take it to the mechanic and it runs great?
Relax, I happen to know she’s going to have one right after lunch.  We are golden.
Sure you can, but it’s kinda technical – you stick all these cool little wires inside her somehow, and –
Oh, right, because it would be much more ethical to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting.  There’s always a team of cardiologists sitting at the next table, this is Jersey!  She’s a minor, she’s going to need consent.
Oh, that’s an excellent plan!  You’ll give him the form and tell him it’s wrong and dangerous.
Okay, I’ll be Crandall.  Dr. Cameron –
Are you in this scene?  Go.
Like to do?  Is this fun for you?
Stay in character!  I’m so scared.  Hold me.
Swear to me on the Bible you’d do this if it was your kid.  Good-bye.
It’s a map of the electrical pathways of the heart.  We send electricity to each, one at a time, until one fails.
It’s a risk I am prepared to take.
Well, who’s been watching Bill Nye the Science Guy?  The test is perfectly safe.  We do it every day.  [as Crandall prepares to sign] And you believe me.
It’s crazy dangerous.  Just sign the damn form.  [hands Crandall a tissue]
Blow your nose.  I need DNA from somewhere.
She’s going to stay around just long enough to get your bank account, your credit card numbers and then she’s going to be off with her next daddy.
Because of what she’s been through.
Because she’s still alive!  Raised by a junkie, living off the streets, that tends to kick the sweetness out of you.
That’s because you’re an idiot.
No, it means I don’t trust her.
Next!  [Leona fidgets, and the monitors beep.]
Is she hallucinating?
Foreman, is she hallucinating?
Then the AV node is not the bad pathway.  All that was was a heart attack.  Reset her so we can find the real problem.
Chase, high right atrium, please.
You have my permission to blame Foreman at any negligence trial.
Freeze it. [Chase presses a button, and CG graphics show the catheter freezing the damaged heart muscle.
She’ll be fine by breakfast.
Interesting reading.
They’re losers.
Donor 1284 likes square dancing.  No one likes square dancing. 613 has been practicing medicine for five minutes, calls himself a healer.  Loves Mozart.
Who they are, what they do, that doesn’t matter?
Oh, sure.  Go with the Jewish number.
But his mother was negative, which means so’s your baby.
The Mediterranean-Dutch factor on the dad’s side?  It’s not a problem, because his dad’s mother didn’t carry the thalassemia gene.  Bigger issue is the jerk composer genes.  This Mozart lie –
You’re designing a kid, a loser kid!  He’s already getting pummeled at recess.
Pretentiousness is hereditary.  Just ‘cause they haven’t found the gene yet…
[poking his head in] What if it wasn’t a hallucination?
Not finished.  What if it was an atypical seizure?
Flashback.  All that wind and rain from the hurricane, post traumatic stress syndrome.
If she did have a hallucination, then the heart problem that we predicted, found, and fixed was just a gigantic coincidence.  [He leaves again.]
[yelling through the wall] What if the heart isn’t a coincidence and isn’t what caused the hallucination?  An arrhythmia hurts.  What if her hallucination was caused by pain?  What if she has a disease that translates pain into a bizarre, physiological response, like a hallucination?
I can prove an autoimmune disease in five minutes.  She needs a PET scan.
I’m proving that her hallucinations are a consistent response to pain, which proves that she has an autoimmune disease.
Easy.  Hurt them.
It’s not going to hurt at all.  We just need to make sure you don’t move.
Okay, give me your arm.  Let’s check your muscle responses.  Okay, turn it over, arm upward.  Everything okay?
You know he’s not your father, don’t you?
I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to hurt you.  [He sticks her again in the leg.]
Come on, we both know it’s a hustle.  Are the walls closing in?
Spiders coming out of my nose?
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!  [He bends one of her fingers back.]  Forget it, he’s not the perfect mark because he was the perfect mark.  Plenty of people got there before you.  He’s used up, tainted.  Pumped dry.  [Leona starts to scream, because she sees House’s face melt away.]
Diagnostically, she needed to be hurt.  I wanted to hurt her.  Win-win.  What I didn’t consider was the threshold to trigger the hallucinations, otherwise I would have done the fingerbending first instead of stabbing her twice.  That was cruel.
Good point.  Let’s kill them all at once.
Good point.  Let’s do that.
Good point.  She’s all alone, poor thing, no one in the whole, wide world.
Because that’s where they keep the bone marrow.
How does someone who believes absolutely everything become a nonfiction writer?
Here’s how this is going to end: One day you’ll be sitting at your computer writing one of your little music books, and your daughter will come home with a big, angry policeman who will throw you in jail because, “Daddy touched my poozle.”
Happy to.
You’re not afraid of the truth?
Easy lay feigns truth, and says she needs a bus ticket home to visit her sick grandma.  You gave her a hundred bucks.  She bought weed.  I know, because I told her you’d go for the sick grandma story.
Come on, do you know me at all?
Did you get a new couch?
What color is it?
Is that where you watch your cartoons after you take your bath?
Fall asleep sometimes?
Bless you.  [Cuddy enters.]
Yes, mistress.  I’ll write you a prescription for one of these.  Just wet and apply.
Not a soul.
No, I’m a really good secret keeper.  I never told anyone that Wilson wets his bed.
Turn around.
Not unless you want me to.
I was just thinking about what your mother looked like, because your father obviously chose her for breeding purposes –
Natural selection sucks.  We pick our mates based on breast size, cars they drive….  They did autopsies on married couples and found correlations in pancreas size. We’re hardwired to pick for stupid reasons, you have the chance to pick for smart reasons.
I’m not advocating wiping out entire races, I’m just saying you don’t want to mate with the first plastic cup that buys you a drink.  [All this time, he’s wiping a patch with a alcohol swab.]
Microbes can be sneaky.
Twice a day.  This is going to be fun.
We were 20 years old, he had a car.  If he had been a woman, I would have married him.
No.  Lying girl lucked out and found one in the registry.
I don’t think so.
Said I wouldn’t.
Stop the radiation.  [House rushes in to find black sludge trickling out of Leona’s mouth.]
I have no idea.
She pooped out of her mouth.
‘Cause it oozed; if it was in her stomach it would have sprayed, if it was in her lungs she would have coughed.  This oozed, as in squeezed, as in reverse peristalsis.  Who’s hungry, Mexican takeout?
Means oops, we were wrong, because no autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours.  We need to do a liver biopsy, find out what the real problem is.
Hey, need to talk to you.  The good news is she doesn’t have an autoimmune condition, so she doesn’t need a bone marrow transplant and we were able to stop the radiation in time.  The bad news: she has potty mouth.  Her liver is failing, she’s made her digestive system go in reverse.  It’s actually much worse than it sounds.  We need to do a liver biopsy.  I don’t know what’s going to happen when we stick a needle into her liver, but she could die right then and there.
No inside information on this one.  But Crandall, three days ago you didn’t even know this girl.  If she’d been hit by a bus you wouldn’t lose a moment’s sleep.  There are people all over this hospital who are in just as much trouble and just as not related to you.
It’s brown, it’s lumpy… I’m going to heave all over my desk.
I’m not protecting him, I’m smacking her.
Push me and I’ll let her die, just so you’ll stop annoying me.
He’s manufacturing responsibility, he’s not maturing.  He hasn’t changed at all.
That black ooze we saw?  That was a bowel movement.  Out of her mouth.
He was having a rough time with his girlfriend.  He was in love, he was always in love.  He wanted to marry her, but I thought she was flaky, sending mixed signals.
No, I told him that I would talk to her.
Technically… [makes a reversing hand gesture]  I was doing him a favor, she was nuts!  [Wilson leaves in disgust, leaving the food, which House eats.  He turns on the music, but turns it off again.  Epiphany time!]
Check it out.
His left hand is very subtle, very delicate.
Be dying a lot faster if I let you do that obviously unnecessary biopsy.  Now listen.
Here’s how to become a great artist.  First, get miserable.  Misery drives you to become a great artist, but the art does nothing for your misery, which drives you to drugs, which makes you a lousy artist, and this is not lousy.
Not when he played this.  Something was screwing with his personality.
And that note that he says is out of tune, it’s not, which means that something is screwing with his aural perception, too.  Now, what happens when you add all that to the liver disease, which he supposedly died of?
Played better when he wasn’t.  I think, I mean, no one knows for sure.
We can test this in three minutes.
So, what is she, Foreman?  Light-skinned black chick or dark-skinned white chick?
True.  This is a photograph of Leona when she was 13 years old.  She’s darker now.
No tan line, so unless those streets she’s been living on are indoor streets, I’m thinking she’s got iron deposits in her melanin, both byproducts of hemochromatosis, just like Granddad used to make.  SQUID exam to calculate the amount of iron in her blood.  And treat her with deferoxamine, she’ll be fine by lunch.  ‘Cause, you see, I was wrong before, about the breakfast….
It’s a done deal.  I knew it the moment I saw you.  Interview’s just a formality.
Lisa Cuddy, this is Patrick Glidahan.  Patrick’s going to be the new intern rotating in my department.
Bet you’ve been doing that your whole life, huh?
We’re all people.  I like that.  She’s all hard science, facts.  I like to know a person’s hopes and dreams.  What kind of music do you like, Patrick?
You see, this is why the face-to-face interview is so important.  You’ve got to know who you’re getting in bed with.
We developed a theory: hemochromatosis.  Like good scientists we tested that theory, we proved that theory.  We acted based on that proof and we treated her.  As a result of which, she is on the verge of death.  Is it just me, or have we discovered a flaw in the scientific method?  Walk me through it, step-by-step.  What is supposed to happen when you give someone deferoxamine?
What does the chelating do?
How?
Moves around where?
Her waste system is a little screwy right now, means the waste can’t go where it wants to go.  What if it went to the lungs?
What likes iron?
No objections to that one?
When in doubt, go broad.
Continue to ventilate her lungs, get her on a voriconazole drip, hope she has Aspergillus.
I looked up ‘loser’ in the cryo bank.  You wouldn’t look within a hundred miles of that idiot, and yet you’re willing to have his baby.
Cotton ball?  I don’t care if you marry this guy, date this guy, go through his garbage, but you should know. Genes matter.  Who you are matters.  Find somebody you trust.
Someone you like.
It’s not what you think.
Or I never ran the test.  [Cameron enters.]  Not what you think!
You can stop.  She ruined it.
Three rules for hunting fungus.  Location, location, location.
Okay, the one thing we know for sure is she was not living in the children’s shelter in Ridgeland.
He wouldn’t, if he believed her story about the sweet little girl trying to do the right thing.
Don’t try to talk, you’ve got a big medical thing in your mouth.  Just blink if you understand.  [Blink.]  Fantastic.  Blink if you lied to Crandall about everything.  You picked up a fungus somewhere.  If you were living in the shelter like you told your new daddy I got nothing to go on, and you will die.  So, did you lie to Crandall?  You’re a lousy con artist.  First rule of the game is know your mark.  Once you got Crandall to bite on the poppet thing you had him.  You could have told him that you were servicing Al Qaeda’s suicide bombers for crack, this guy would still let you pick out the colors in your new room.  Did you lie to Crandall?  [Blink.  House puts a pen and paper in her hands.]  Where were you?
And the winner is… oh, you read it, I just get so nervous at these things.
She read the book.  She knew how much Crandall hated that place, what went on there.  She overplayed her hand.
Recording studios.  Why are these buildings different from all other buildings?
Where there’s moisture, a lot of it, let’s say, Katrina moist, there’s –
Start her on an IV drip of Amphotericin B with colony stimulating factors.  She’ll be fine by… dinner.
You’re welcome.  You came all the way up here just to tell me that?
Pretty much normal.  Liver function tests are good.
What makes you think you’d be a good father?
Well, at least you’ve got a good reason.
She’s choking, she can’t breathe.  Get him out of here, will you?  Out!  [grabs random instruments] Quick, the curtain!  You’re breathing on your own, choking’s normal.  I lied to him, I ran a paternity test.  Your lie was a bad one.  He is your dad.  [to Crandall]  We’re even.
He’s got a temperature of 103.
Because we’re human beings.  It’s what we do.  Said he was at a luncheon meeting.
Guy looks like Harpo.  You should see him.
It’s hilarious to watch him try and talk.  I asked him anything I could think of.  Favorite color?  “Bwuu.”
Favorite dessert topping?  [The man, who will now be known as Vince, hesitates.] Trust me, you’ll never know what fact may be the key to saving your life
I asked him if he was sure.  [Foreman packs up.]  Where’re you going?
I know.  Where’re you going?
Skinny brunette.
I’m skinny.  How do you know her name?
Oh, well, if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs – [Jack pulls out a gun and shoots House in the side.  Cameron gasps, and as House collapses against the whiteboard, the three teammates start to run toward him.]
You’re pathetic. [Cameron puts down her book.]  Judging by the growth, I’d say I’ve been unconscious for two days.  You’ve been sitting there the whole time.
Judging by the oily buildup in your hair, I’d say you’re lying.
Did I lose any organs?
Well, I always say, if you’re going to get shot, do it in a hospital.
I don’t remember that one.
Don’t care.
I assume his reasoning was faulty.  So what was it?  Infection?
Not me.  Patient.  Harpo.
I got shot.  Diagnostically boring.  Big fat tongue, on the other hand, endlessly entertaining.
And it was negative.  And the blood tests were negative.
You don’t biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue and you don’t have to biopsy a tongue unless you’ve already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests which don’t involve torturing the patient.  Any other symptoms beside the increased intracranial pressure?  Any guesses on how I figured that one out?
I’m talking to Cuddy.
[as he’s walking out with his IV] Not today, today I’m on morphine.
Check Harpo’s trash.
Come on, you’re curious.  Trash.  You don’t know what I’m talking about, but you know it’s good.
Well, then, stop me.
Physically, stop me.
You can’t, because that would involve touching me and then things would get so sexually charged – [Cameron physically stops him.  Oh, how things are… sexually charged?]  I’m twice your size, get your hands off me.
Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.
He needs to be shot again.
If your security was any good I wouldn’t have been shot in the first place.  [He fiddles with the morphine drip.]
Who did my surgery?
He screwed up.
I’m not.  I’m reducing it.
I’m feeling better.
My stomach kills me, my neck is throbbing, my leg feels better.
It’s unbelievable.  Since getting shot is not an FDA-approved treatment for anything, it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery.
He must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system.  If it’s alleviating pain, who knows what else it’s doing.
Why did you try to kill me?
Then the gun thing might have been a mistake.
I’m fine, I think.  Cameron, you got my records?
And yet you’re holding them.  And whispering.
Yeah.  Killer needs his rest.  Otherwise he’s grumpy all day.  [House bangs on Jack’s bed with his cane.] Hey!  Wake up!  Watch me save a life!
Do an LP.  [to Jack] See what I did there?  Couldn’t have done that if you killed me.
Couldn’t have put it better myself.  [They leave, and House is left to his notes.]
I have a rule.  People who shoot me forfeit the right to –
Oh, I know this story.  She died, so you selected one of her doctors to kill because that would make everything right again.
I’m truly sorry I did that.
You caught crap.  She left you.  Now I’ve gotta pay because you couldn’t keep your little Killer in you pants.
What sort of hospital has glass walls?
Really?
No, I just figured a co-worker or sister, not wife.
Don’t worry, it’s not insulting.  At least, not to you.  You’re satisfied with that answer?
You’re not going to shoot me, are you?
Sevens marry sevens, nines marry nines, fours marry fours.  Maybe there’s some wiggle room if there’s enough money or if somebody got pregnant.  But you’ve got at least three points on your husband and your frock says he didn’t do it for the money and your breasts say you haven’t had any kids.
Numbers don’t lie.  We’re having trouble finding out what infection your husband has.  The most likely culprit is an STD.
Is your friend single?
I should go.  [His hand is bloody, and there is blood on his robe.]  I seem to have torn my stitches.  [He collapses on the floor.]
I remember.  I was there.
You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?
You shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener?  [Jack smirks.]  You’re an ass.
The shooting just makes you an idiot.  You’re an ass because you’re trying to wrap it in a flag like you did a good thing.
Watch out, you’re getting crumbs on the flag.  I didn’t commit to honor her, I didn’t commit to never lie to her.
If you kept your pistols in your pants –
Here’s how life works.  You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people.  Not both.
Infections don’t make your eyes pop out.
Not done eating.  Got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.
Look, my stitches pop out again, I got three doctors to save me.  Could be some sort of weakness in the lining of the ocular veins.  [The team is silent.]  Okay, I’ll be you guys.  [in an Australian accent] “No way, mate!  Too much blood to just be a vein!  No way hizzy!  If it was an artery, he’d still be bleeding!” [And now on to Cameron] “Actually, he’d be dead.”
Tongue and eyes are sick.  What about the nose?  It’s right in between, why isn’t it sick?
Which can only be what?
Check the brain’s trash, see what it's hiding.
I know, all its garbage just gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road.
What else?  Biopsy the barrier.
Biopsy the barrier, first start him on mebendazole in case it’s a worm.
I really don’t think the wife is the kind to be messing around.  If I was married to her I certainly wouldn’t –
My body is fine. [He’s looking over the operation notes again.]  My mind, on the other hand –
Spoke to every nurse on that floor, the patient only had six visitors.  Two females, no babes.  His mother and his aunt.
My posse never saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.
There’s only one possible conclusion.  It was a hallucination.  What does that look like to you, a .6? [He holds the chart up to Wilson.]
My perceptions are compromised and my judgment is compromised.  What if his wife told me that the patient just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leopard?
And the next case?
And what if I don’t?  What if it wasn’t the shooting?
What if it was the surgery?
Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?
We need to talk.
Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?
How do you know it’s mine?
My anesthesia was almost non-existent, and yet I wasn’t awake.  For some reason, someone decided to put me in a dissociative coma instead of just putting me out.
Fine, I’ll go beat the truth out of my surgeon.  Gillick, right?  [He stalks off.  Cuddy notices that, while he is carrying his cane, he isn’t using it to walk, and isn’t even limping much.]
You had no right!
You messed with my brain!
No.  It’s a point of principle.
Don’t worry, I’m sure something else is wrong.
On which side?
The first thing that makes sense.
You worried?  I marked a change of meds on his chart.  [and back to Vince] Foreign object, body wants to get rid of it, causes the fever.
Find it.
Have been negative.  What do you do if your trash cans are full?  You use your neighbor’s trash cans.  Except it’s still light outside, your neighbor will see you.  So you go out the back way, into an alley and drop off your trash by their garage.
You got that from trash cans in the alley?
Yeah.  Go get lung lymph.  [The team leaves.]
I wouldn’t have hired him if he wasn’t smart.
How the hell did you know I was awake?
No they do not.
Test was negative.
Force of habit.
The blood had to come from somewhere.  You took a shower in it.
You think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels and poke out his eye and swell up his tongue?  Keep riding, I’ve got a bet with my physio that I can do 100 clicks by Friday.  What about blood from the kidneys?  [They all stare at him.]
Yeah, basic human anatomy.  Therefore, I think it’s safe to assume that the problem lies elsewhere.  But given that this case doesn’t make any kind of sense whatsoever maybe we should even question the basics.
An anatomical defect would seem more likely, but let’s not rule that one out.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  Question is why I didn’t think of it.
Sac blowing up, on the other hand…
I screwed up some basic anatomy and I’m misconnecting a testicular explosion with a testicular problem.  Think there’s any way I would have done that before Cuddy messed with my brain?
Yeah, I can run like the wind, but I can’t think.  Seeing as how I’m too old to become a professional athlete, she screwed me over, big time. [They move to the hallway.]
Oh, here we go.
Well, here’s the flaw in your argument: if I enjoy hating life, I don’t hate life, I enjoy it.
I don’t define myself by my leg.
Why are you protecting her?
You’re completely comfortable with what she did to me?
You agonize over moral choices.  You aren’t completely comfortable with anything until you’ve taken days to get your head around every possible side.  I’ve known what she did for six hours.  How come you’re acting like you’ve known for days?
What do I have?!
What do I have?!?
I have my brain.  That’s it!
Yeah, nobody tries to screw up, they just do!
I can make people better!  And you decide to trade that for jogging shoes!
You value the physical so much, let me put this in terms you understand!  [He punches Wilson in the jaw.]
Yeah, I’m hallucinating!
How did you know I was –
No.
I never called Wilson by his name.
You’re not the hallucinatee, Wilson was the hallucinatee.
Cuddy’s office was the hallucinatee, the bathroom was the hallucinatee.
What figures?
Damn it.  [He tries to hide it as the team enters.  They don’t notice it at all.]
No.
So, let’s recap.  We’ve just ruled out everything, which doesn’t make sense, and the answer has to be something that does make sense.  Do a cystoscopy, make sure he’s human.
For him being human?
Hmm.  Find out if his father hunched?  [And down the stairs.]  His father have trouble peeing?  [And up, and down and up.]  His father have sex with his own mother?  The answer to any of these questions, if yes, assume you’re right.  If the answer’s no, assume you’re right, but biopsy some prostate lymphs just to make sure.
How did I get here?
I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys.  What happened in between?  I don’t remember how I got here.
I’m taking myself off my case.
I think I’m losing my mind.  I’m having blackouts.
I lied.
I’m off the case.  [as he turns to leave]  Why did you jump up when I came in?
Again?
No, I wasn’t.
That was a hallucination –
-- which means this is a hallucination.
How can I tell what’s real and what’s not?  Everything looks the same, sounds the same, tastes the same.
Why not?  You’re obviously not here.  I’m obviously not here, which means this is a creation of my mind, which means I’m really just asking my mind.
Hey, I’m trying to work this out.  That requires give and take, even in my own mind.
How can I tell what’s real?
That doesn’t sound like something I’d ask.
With you so far.
That sounds like me.
So I trust my team.
Something doesn’t make sense.  What does that mean?  It’s not rhetorical.  I need your input on everything I ask, no matter how obvious it might seem.
It means one of your assumptions is wrong, because if something doesn’t make sense it can’t be real.  So what are our assumptions?
Let’s go more basic.
Tests themselves.  What does a biopsy consist of?
Define sample.
You go down the shore, you fill a cup with water.  It’s got no fish in it.  Does that mean no fish in the ocean?
We can fill another cup of water, but we’ve gotta dive in.  We’ve gotta see what’s actually in there.
What if we could find a way of doing the surgery without giving him more than a papercut?
People suck.  People have turned you from a guy with a swollen tongue into a guy with one guy, one ball and a stapled-on face.  If you want someone to hold you while you cry yourself to sleep at night, choose warm and soft.  If you want someone to write you a poem, pick the sensitive loner.  If all you care about is that something’s done right, pick the guy with the metal head.
No way no way.  You’ve gotta see this thing in action before you say “no way.”  Come on.  [He helps Vince to sit up.]
Nothing.  I’m not doing anything.  Just throwing out ideas.  I think you should put him in a wheelchair and take him down to the OR, but I may be out of my mind.
Relax, Cameron.  I’m not going to cut you.  I just want to show what this puppy can do.  I can make one millimeter incisions.  You know how small that is?  Small even in metric.  [to Vince] If I do something that doesn’t make sense, even to you, stop me.  [He moves the tweezer hand down to stroke Cameron’s cheek.]  Delicate, no?  [He then lifts up the hem of her shirt and uses the air hand to blow air into her belly button.  And then he cuts off a button on her blouse, peeling part of the shirt away to reveal her bra.
Does that hurt.  [Cameron shakes her head.]  Seen enough?
That wasn’t a question.  You either do this, or you die.
Yeah.  If only I’d dedicated my life to finding someone worthy to shoot.
Not to me.  [House is searching for a pen to write on the board with.]
I care because I live.  I can’t care if I’m dead.  [He moves to the wall, dragging the bed with him because he’s still chained to it.]
You anti-semantic bastard.
Working, here.
[looking at his makeshift whiteboard] That does not make sense.
I’m sorry.  I know what’s wrong.
He’ll be fine.
How come you guys have never tried to yank me off this case?  I’m having hallucinations, blackouts.
I’m almost always eventually right.  You have no way of knowing when ‘eventually’ is.  Every time I’ve had an epiphany on this one you guys were right on board.  No challenges, nothing to explain.  No offense, but either you guys are getting smarter or I’m getting dumber.
I know the test results even before you enter the room.  We have identical knowledge.  How is that possible?
Something doesn’t make sense.  One of your assumptions has to be wrong, because if something doesn’t make sense then it can’t be real.  But what if the faulty assumption is that it’s real?
I’ve lost it.  [He starts to move his hand toward the robot controls; Chase grabs it.]  Why did you stop me?
You don’t think that.  You know it, because you’re in my head.  As long as the delusion makes sense my mind lets it go on.  To make it not make sense I have to push it past the point where it can trick my mind.  [He grabs the controls.]
It’s also possible I may already be dead, but I don’t believe in the afterlife.
This is not real, therefore it’s meaningless.  I want meaning.  [He stabs Vince in the bellybutton, and makes a deep incision up to about his stomach.  Organs force their way out of his chest.  He flatlines quickly.  As the team looks on horrified, House walks toward Vince.]  Oh, God.  [Vince’s hand falls down, and out drops a bullet.  House picks it up and clutches it.]  Goodbye.
Hello.
You don’t know that.  Tell Cuddy I want ketamine.
It's just... 8 miles.
Why does a dog lick its – [He takes the water from her hand and starts to drink it. Yes he’s just drinking her water.] workplace acceptable euphemism for testicles?
What have you got for me boss?
[He puts down the water and picks up a file.] If I'd come back sooner, I'd only be able to run 6 miles. I never would have made it in. What have you got for me?
It’s been 2 months. It's not wearing off. What have you got for me? [He picks up one of the files and starts looking through it himself.]
Why are we having this discussion? Want to hear me thank you again? Thank you Dr Cuddy. Not just for removing the bullet, but thank you for putting me in a ketamine-induced coma and changing my life. Happy? I am.
Infection throwing clots, you're an idiot. [Cuddy throws a smile at Wilson.] Except you're not an idiot, [House looks at Wilson and then Cuddy.] and she's holding a file for a 26-yr-old female, what have you really got for me?
Oh, well played sir! [He grabs the file off Cuddy but continues to read the one in his hands.] What about Stephen Hawking trying to do the 500 butterfly?
Hmm... I'll take them both.
Of course he had brain cancer; even oncologists don't screw up for 8 years.
Treatment can be interesting.
I've changed.
No, I haven't.
Guy tried to kill himself.
He's been in that chair for 8 years, his muscles have atrophied. Maybe I can help him with the pain. Isn't that enough of a reason to want to help?
I've changed.
Then why am I taking this case? [He suddenly sprints ahead of Wilson and runs off.]
Let's start with the cute paraplegic.
Quad with no broken neck, struck me as odd.
Taken a whole month to ease back, 8 weeks is the maximum rehab time for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck. So, go. [He takes a drink from the fridge and starts drinking.]
What? You think he might have shot this patient too? Would explain her symptoms…
See? It's not so difficult.
It's not MS. She had no symptoms before she climbed on to her head. Unless she's been upside-down for the last 10 years, MS ain't it.
When did this turn into 'what did you do over your summer vacation'?
No, I like the carpet. What did you do over the summer?
Re-do the tests. [He walks away from her.] Let's see if the source of the problem is in the limbs or the spine. Do an EMG. [The Ducklings prepare to walk out.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Got a whole other quad to cover; this guy's still got fluid in his lungs.
Give him an O2 mask. His leg muscles have atrophied, tendons have shortened from disuse causing intense pain. Tendon surgery will make him more comfortable.
Scoot.
Not a problem.
You haven't spoken to him in over 6 years.
Fine. I'm wrong. You obviously have a better understanding of this man who drools in front of your TV set 24 hours a day.
Hope it was a suicide attempt. If he was trying to kill himself then he knows how miserable his life is, means there's still something there to kill; means your dad's still there.
I loaned her some money. What went wrong?
Nothing went wrong then something went right.
You're not going to tell me what went right?
For you. Saw you coming up, thought you were a 14-yr-old boy, I set her straight.
Ohhh, you got me. You know I need to know, I'm so going to fold. Except you're forgetting, there's one thing I can do now. [He casts a curious glance at something behind her, she turns to look and he quickly runs off, she laughs and follows.]
What happened?
Pleasure's all mine, what happened?
[To Cameron as she walks in.] She flinched! Did you hear?
How big is a flinch? Bigger than a twitch? Smaller than a spasm? [Chase inserts the pin again so House can see the flinch.] You smoke?
You do yoga and you smoke?
Not at all, the world sees your legs, no one's checking out your lungs. [He goes and checks out Caren's handbag.]
It wouldn't, just needed a lighter. [He takes one out, goes to the bottom of Caren's bed, holds a foot in his hand and turns on the flames right under it. She screams and jerks her leg away and he stops.]
[Gives the puppy dog eyes.] The case was looking so promising.
You moved, therefore you can move. Get this lunatic out of here before she bores again.
She thanked me.
Wasn't even sure what I was supposed to feel.
Told you to get rid of her.
Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.
Relax. I'm not going to burn you again. I'm going to STAB YOU! [He brings out the needle suddenly, trying to scare her. Caren continues gasping for breath.] Look, either you're faking, or you've got a pleural effusion - that's a build-up of fluid around the lungs which is very serious - and I would have no choice but to stab you in the back with this needle and suck all the fluid out of you. [Caren looks terrified, but continues gasping for breath.] So--
That would defeat the point of me being nasty. [He stands next to her with the needle.] Ready? [He raises his arm and pretends to strike until he notices a distended jugular vein on her neck.] Down.
Down!
Down! Down, down, down! Come on! [He pushes her to lie flat on her back again before he spears the needle straight into her chest to the surprise of the Ducklings, and starts drawing out blood. Caren's breathing becomes easier.]
Can't fake that.
But not the paralysis. Let's assume that she wasn't faking it.
Ehh... doesn't mean she was faking, could have been a delusion. Now, either she was faking, and coincidentally got a real cardiac problem at the exact same time, or it's a delusion and the fake paralysis is a real neurological symptom.
So, open her up, and find it. [He bounces the ball he normally plays with on Chase's head - to Chase's annoyance.]
That should work. [He tosses the ball back to Chase before walking out the door.]
His heart rate's a little high.
Probably just means he's still in discomfort from the surgery. I'm going to up his morphine a little.
That's the job.
His heart rate's come down, the morphine worked I was right.
Would you like to get a drink?
No, I'm serious. I drink, you drink. We could do it at the same time, same table. Do you eat? We could do that too. I mean, if the answer's no that's cool but... [He waits for her response as they stop in front of the elevators.]
Oh, don't take it personally. Its just coz you're full of crap. You have no interest in going out with me. Maybe you did, when I couldn't walk and I was a sick puppy that you could nurture back to health. Now that I'm healthy, there's nothing in it for you.
Who won the pool?
What's the worst that can happen? I paralyze her. She won't even notice.
[Sits down in the chair opposite Cuddy.] Fine, I'll lower it. If you'll let me do the surgery.
You want something, I want something. We compromise. It's the grown-up way to resolve our differences.
Ran a few more tests, came back negative, surgery's on. [The next grape he throws does land on the cleaner's head. House quickly and guiltily shuffles back out of view from below, leaving Wilson standing there alone. Wilson does an apologetic hand gesture and turns back to face House.]
Does that make me evil?
The girl's life is at stake, what we're talking about with the guy--
Too bad for them.
Sixth level is heroin; seventh level is you going away.
I'm not an idiot. [To nurse.] Move.
Close her up, you wanna know why?
True, it's not the most interesting reason. [He shows the Surgeon Caren's big toe which is has a very ugly cracking yellow nail, and the area around the nail looks bruised and bleeding.] That is not a sexy big toe. You'd never put that in your mouth.
Told you it was interesting; it gets even better.
It's just post-op discomfort. He's ready to go home.
Eventually.
Everything else will be the same.
Why don't you put him in some sort of... facility? Some place without a pool.
Right. Kids need a dad; someone to play catch with. Talk about girls.
Get a dog.
Some guy shot you and you hallucinated?
So he's just an anchor weighing you and your family down, sapping your energy, wasting your life - that's the meaning you take from this?
You enjoy this?
So you don't want to take care of him. Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you, make you happy. But not taking care of him would make you miserable.
Here, let me...
Do that again, make that sound.
That... was talking.
You guys are lousy doctors. You're in such a rush to make the patient feel better you forgot to check what was wrong.
Not her, the other guy.
Until last night, he spoke.
Guhhhhhhh.
Sounds good. Call me when you're done.
I am not bored. [He attempts to do a trick where he pushes the skateboard down from the stone bench to the ground, while attempting to stay on it. He falls off.] Damn it.
Of course not, because then she would never have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests. I don't remember you being this bitchy.
Can't let her down like that, pumped her up with too much false hope. [He attempts the trick again and this time, he sticks on the skateboard.] Oh! I stuck that primo! How rad am I? [Wilson's only reaction is to look resigned.]
Any patterns?
I like it.
Not the kidney part, the pain part. Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst.
It's the first symptom on the board. Grunt.
No, traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm, vibration of the larynx leading to the audible sound 'I have a pain in my abdomen'.
Illnesses have incubation periods. Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.
You're talking about him like he's an invalid.
Does he drool? Can he hold his neck straight? Does he choke on his food? His neck's fine, his throat's not going to collapse. Cameron, get consent from the wife.
Get a look at the pancreas before the world ended?
This man nearly died. How can you discharge him?
Except that our patient's throat was sedated. Which means the brain should have sent a signal not to do anything. This could be cancer, or some bizarre neuro-degeneration, even a new type of vasculitis--
I find it interesting.
[Turns to Foreman.] Half hour to remove the probe? [Foreman nods.]
It's not a spasm. His throat didn't collapse, it locked down. Brain is supposed to tell every muscle in the body to relax and contract at the same time, this muscle was only contracting which means a signal from the brain was not getting through.
All it takes is one wire down.
A few micro-tumors on the meninges, suddenly you're choking to death.
No, he won't.
The brain is enclosed in a sac called the meninges--
No, no, no, no.
If we found cancer, it wouldn't be the original cancer. It'd be new.
Might not be the worst thing. If this isn't just ancient history then maybe it's something we can correct. Might even get some brain function back.
But understanding what you're saying would be nice. Maybe you can figure out ways to communicate.
I'm lucky? He's the one who didn't die.
Told me he'd bleed into his brain, not out of his ear.
We're missing something.
[Gets off the stool and starts looking at the scans up close.] Give me a tour of the brain, Foreman. Walk me through the scans. 1998, what happened?
Nothing. Next, a speck on the superior temporal region.
Star thingy next to the Rathke cleft.
Re-do every blood test he's ever had. Re-scan his head.
That's ok, Foreman's better at that stuff than you are. We need 5mm cuts through the occipital and hypothalamic regions.
I can help him.
Seems like a good one.
Does nobody in this hospital have anything better to talk about than my motives? My motives have nothing to do with the case.
For the first time in years I've got no opiates in my body, now you question my judgment.
I didn't want to bore you with the details.
My leg hurt.
Enough that I'm telling you.
Ached for a while. First time I felt anything there since the surgery.
It was muscular, it was some cramping. [Wilson smiles.] What are you smiling about?
Just give me a prescription.
I know what the pangs of middle age feel like.
The surgery didn't work.
You think this is a scam?
[Whispered.] Come on. [He gestures for her to open her window so he can talk to her.]
Circumventricular system sends his cytokines, releasing the early stages of the immune response but CDOS releases prostaglandins that reset the hypothalamic set point upward, unless it's countered by antipyretic therapy. [He's panting as he says this obviously having run to Cuddy’s house.] So yeah, his brain's on fire. The suicide attempt was not a suicide attempt; he drove that wheelchair into the pool because he couldn't regulate his body temperature. He had hypothalamic dysregulation.
Fountain. I can cure him.
No, but if the scar tissue on his hypothalamus is resting against the pituitary, the adrenals would shut down. Addison's disease.
His brain is functional.
I can make him walk! I can make him talk!
Inject him with cortisol. The guy will have sex with his wife again, he'll hug his kid again. Hopefully that's the combination he was using, it'd be a shame if I'd cured a pedophile. [Cuddy smiles despite herself.] You're smiling, that's a bad sign.
I told you, I haven't had anything in 3 months.
[Sighs.] Your decision doesn't make any sense. There is no risk to a cortisol injection. If I'm wrong, big deal. He goes home a vegetable like he already is, but if I'm right--
She was right to say no. I had no objective reason to think that I was right. Just needed the puzzle.
Showered at home.
Is this an intervention? It’s a little late, since I’m not using drugs anymore. I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
Thought of you in the shower.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world. [Gets into the elevator.]
Do I need a restraining order?
He ever get his feelings hurt? I’ll need to know that, too.
Why, in case he’s telling the truth? You’re a believer, aren’t you?
No. But I’m guessing we’re the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.
Perfect. Especially if there were neurological problems.
Well, why is that a hallucination?
He’s having nightmares. Nightmares aren’t a symptom of anything, other than wanting to sleep with Mommy. Which just leaves us with one symptom: the bloody tuchas, which can easily be explained by a GI problem or a bleeding disorder. Check his coags with PT, PTT, and bleeding time. And prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
Great! You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
So it’s a simple bleeding disorder.
So it’s a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
So it’s a UFO, unidentified flowing orifice. Either you screwed up the test, or I screwed up my analysis of this case. If you screwed up, I don’t have to cry myself to sleep. It’s a simple bleeding disorder. Foreman, redo the test.
You sure?
So you’re saying Chase did screw up.
Oh, snap! Foreman’s playing the dozens; you’re at a cultural disadvantage here. Take a few minutes to think up a witty retort.
Yeah, testing, nice idea. Way better than trying to guess which doctor’s incompetent. Much better than the paperwork, too.
Oh, no! Well, you take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint. Let’s pray he hasn’t gone into hyperdrive! We’ll never catch him.
Results came back. The lab cannot identify the metal. They said it might not even be terrestrial.
No, you idiot! It’s titanium. Like from a surgical pin, like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago, nice medical history.
So what, a little piece broke off during removal.
Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.
Yeah. An alien chip makes more sense. The real mystery is you didn’t actually screw up. [He stumbles.]
Fine. I tripped. Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck, apparently didn’t bleed to death. Now that’s weird.
Sure did. So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there’s not again.
Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
Tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, MI, and blindness.
Solve the case. Kidneys could –
[Fingers crossed.] Tell me he’s a mutant human hybrid.
She was being metaphorical. Trying to sound like me. I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.
Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors. Even someone low on von Willenbrand’s could theoretically clot.
I know I get worked up when I cut microchip tracking implants out of my neck.
Yeah, we get it. Okay, what’s the differential for a seven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
Why don’t I have hi-def in my office? I’m a department head!
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
See, this is what I’m talking about. Foreman, you’ve got to steal this thing for me.
We’re gonna need a bigger boat.
There.
Right there. Left side, no movement. [Cameron freezes the shot.] Well, don’t freeze it! Something’s not moving, how do you see something not move if nothing’s moving? [She restarts it.]  I need the laser pointer.
Well, why not? Who’s going to take us seriously if we don’t have a laser pointer? Right here! [He jumps to point at the spot on the screen; as he lands he grimaces and clutches at his leg.] A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.
That’s not an arrhythmia, that’s a no-rhythmia. Myocytes contract, these aren’t moving at all. Go get me those myocytes; I want to talk to them in my office.
Heart nearly exploded. Still beating, though. Most of it, anyway. Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click, “Yes, I am 18”? Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
First, tell me what’s going on with the boobs.
They’re firmer.
I think it’s hormones.
Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
Guess I should be saying ‘mazel tov.’ Who gets to pass out the cigars?
Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?
My leg doesn’t hurt.
No, I’m not! Oh, you got me. If I thought my leg was deteriorating, don’t you think I’d want to take steps to prevent that?
Gotta go. [As he leaves, he fake stumbles. Cuddy helps him up; He gives her a look with a "ha".]
That is impossible. Run it again.
Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
That much sun, he’d be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
So first Daddy was a rapist, now he’s a chemist.
Not unless the kid’s been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia, or both. [While this is going on, House has limped from the whiteboard to lean over the table.]
Is that question helping?
You’re sitting.
My head’s hurting. Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid’s alien DNA.
Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
Okay, let’s do that.
What do you want?
When did you become an enabler?
I’d rather not become dependant on pain pills to get through my day. [He throws them back.]
I’m as happy as a pig in poop.
What part of poop didn’t you understand?
It’s my leg. We’ve known each other a long time.
Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier. Don’t use an IV this time; get it right into the brain.
What if it is there but didn’t show up on the scan? What if the tag just doesn’t work in his brain? Brain cells are structurally different, express a different protein.
I am going to think.
Send the kid home.
Make sure his blood pressure’s stabilized and send him home.
We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find.
It’s more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
May be epilepsy, may be psychological, may be nothing. If the kid gets sick again it’ll give us another clue, we can start searching again. If he doesn’t, it doesn’t matter. Send him home.
You’ve got to know when to stop.
Except on my last case.
When did you develop such strong opinions about my patients? Last week you were convinced that my patient wasn’t sick, now you’re convinced this one is.
Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg. That’s where we found most of it. Maybe we could just remove his affected eye completely.
I’m not going to start lopping off body parts, but it’s interesting that you’d give me the green light.
You’ve been overly supportive this entire week. Either you’re hormonal or you’re guilt-ridden. And it’s too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
Then what did you do wrong?
[To Cuddy’s belly.] Oh, your mommy’s in such trouble. She’s such a liar! That’s why you don’t have a daddy. That’s why she had to – [And… epiphany.]
How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?
Our assumptions are faulty.
I didn’t say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty. We assumed he’s a person.
Well, you’re being silly. What if he’s not a person, what if he’s two persons?
No metaphor. Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
The kid was right all along, he was implanted with something. Back when he was really young, I mean really young, I mean twelve cells young. In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
Not walking around. But in vitro fertilization costs about 25 grand a pop. [CGI of… well, cells merging.] So doctors implant about two to six embryos to make sure you get your money’s worth. Problem is, there’s not always enough bedrooms for all of the kiddies. Two brothers get stuck sharing, there’s no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm. They never untangle. He’s two people in one. It’s called chimerism.
Unfortunately, his brother’s like a bad doubles partner. The guy just takes up space, gets in the way. Clancy’s body thinks that he’s going to put away the easy winners, but his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net. We’ve got to get him off the court.
Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine. Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks. If we induce an alien abduction –
The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son’s brain that makes him believe that he’s being abducted. We stimulate those neurons with an electric probe; we can trick your son’s brain into hallucinating. And your son’s neurons will light up, and his brother’s cells will remain dark. Those are the ones we cut out.
I’m talking about really cool brain surgery. One of your sons will die, but the taller one won’t be so annoying any more.
Start us out at ten. [House is doing the brain surgery. Wait, what? Clancy’s arm twitches.]
That was all me, kid. Sorry.
Any dark spots?
Well, turn up the juice.
Riding the short bus is better than not breathing. Take us to 100.
Crank it up higher!
[In front of Clancy’s face.] They’re going to get you! They’re coming through the walls. They’re going to take you, torture you! You’ll never see your parents again. [And all the CGI guys on House weep for joy, because all they really want to do is work in sci-fi, and here it is, an alien abduction scene, complete with bizarre probes.]
Close him up.
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
She lied to me. She cured my patient with my diagnosis, then lied to me about it.
You’re right. It does sound like you, though.
Nothing that your body language isn’t telling me right now. So, what was the plan? That I’d feel so humble by missing a case that I’d reevaluate my entire life, question nature, truth, and goodness and become Cameron?
God doesn’t limp. [House leaves and Wilson looks very, very tired.]
71 year old cancer research specialist. Minor tremors, localized melanoma removed 2 years ago, cataracts. And he can't breathe. Also, disregard the facial lacerations. They're creepy, but unfortunately irrelevant. [He winks.] Don't you wanna know why?
No, why the lacerations are creepy. He was about to dissect one of his lab rats when he collapsed. The little vermin seized the day, so to speak and went medieval on his ass. [The Ducklings stare at him with frowns.] What, my fly open?
There was no pain, he was unconscious. I'm guessing, because he wasn't able to breathe.
Obviously. I'm obviously not. What is it with you people? I don't use the cane, you're shocked. I use the cane…
About the wrong person. I can breathe. Ezra Powell on the other hand, is gonna die.
*That* textbook, THE textbook.
I… admire lots of doctors. 'Course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe.
You're being too nice. [He looks up at them.] Outside the hospital he can't breathe, inside the hospital he can. Means we help, at least enough to screw with our test results. The source of the problem's either in his heart or his lungs. So all we gotta do is stop helping, put a little pressure on him, and see which gives out first.
That's why we're gonna do it in a hospital. Put him on an incline treadmill and do a stress EKG. [He grabs a donut and limps into his office with the cane.]
His heart rate barely got above 90.
It's 'cause he's not trying hard enough. If he was, his heart rate would go up.
They don't call it a stress test for nothing. Do it again.
It's kinda hard to check your throat when you're flapping your gums around.
Cold. [He hands him the slip of paper.] Take this 4 times a day, and stay off airplanes. Flying cesspools.
Please don't get up. I'm sure you're very busy. [He gets a syringe from a cart.] I'm just gonna try and speed things up a little.
See? That's why he doesn't have to wear knee socks.
130. [Powell looks scared, and like he can't breathe.] The magic number. Nothing here. Foreman?
Which means it's not the heart. So it must be the lungs. [Goes over to the cart to put the syringe down, not to get another syringe to calm the guy.] See? That wasn't so hard, was it?
Neither is mine. He's depressed. He'll feel much better after we cure him.
You can't know that without knowing what's wrong.
Wow. [The ducklings snap to attention.] Certainly a lot of interesting things to consider. Stress EKG rules out the heart, which means something's gotta be attacking his lungs. Mycoplasmas or strep pneumo, which probably means it's too late to do anything about it. We could try levofloxacin.
Oh, come on. He's old, and sick, and tiny. We can do whatever we want to him.
No, all services rendered on a first-come, first-served basis.
You're hurting me. [They let go, Powell begins to cough, spitting out the meter.] Fine; you don't help us, we don't help you. [House faces him and speaks slowly.] Your lungs slowly fill with fluid. You gasp to catch every breath but never can. Every breath is petrifying. It'll be slow, painful; torturous.
What if you could? How 'bout we make a deal? Give me one more day. If I don't find out exactly what's wrong with you by then, I help you die.
24 hours. Come on, it's not gonna kill you.
Of course I can. Chase says we do it all the time. [Chase rolls his eyes.]
Enough! You don't want me to kill him. Fine. Here's a big shock; I don't wanna kill him either. How do I not kill him? By you guys doing your job. We have 24 hours to figure out what's wrong with him. [Impatiently waiting for ideas from the ducklings.] Tick tock, tick tock.
It's gonna take longer than 24 hours.
[Nods.] Great. Do an amylase, D-dimer, C-reactive peptide, get a urine, and do a bronchial sputum while you're at it. [He indicates Cameron.] You check his home and lab for radiation and toxins. [He indicates Foreman.] And do a bone marrow biopsy.
Nah. Whatever you don't get done you can finish at the autopsy.
What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?
What? What've you been doing all night?
Your protégé. What are these?
Why?
Or he's losing his memory.
Yes, we could assume that, and we'd have nothing. Or we could assume it's a symptom, in which case whatever's in his lungs, is also in his brain. Unless you got something more promising.
Keep testing 'til you find something. I'm going to my office to rest for awhile. [They all glare after him.]
Not according to the history.
Or he's telling the truth. Which means fungus is still on the table.
Bad news fast. Good news you can take your time.
Too bad. If his brain was addled, we wouldn't have to listen to anything he says.
Then we have no reason to talk to him. We still haven't ruled out fungus.
[Sighs.] Okay. Next procedure; we sneak in, turn back the clock. [Wilson smiles, Cameron looks forlorn.]
Nope. Bone marrow biopsy revealed multiple myeloma. [Chase and Foreman exchange looks.] It's not good news, but there are some treatments. [Cameron is staring at House] We have to draw some blood…
Associated hyperviscosity syndrome; gummed up the blood vessels in your lungs.
Mm. We call him Dr. Idiot. [Chase rolls his eyes, Foreman crosses his arms.]
Odd presentation.
Just give me 12 more hours.
Fair enough. Give me six more hours. [Powell purses his lips.] Listen; there is no evidence that you are terminal.
No, as a matter of fact, I'm not.
Everybody who can walk should get outta here. [House takes morphine and a syringe out of the kit.]
Can’t do what? Administer a prescription painkiller to a patient who’s in pain? Go. Make sure somebody sees you downstairs in the cafeteria.
[Holding up syringe, while talking to Foreman.] What’s gonna happen here is that someone’s getting a butt-load of morphine. I’m not sure exactly who at this point. [Foreman takes a moment to think it over, and then leaves the room in a huff.]
Nothing. [House injects the morphine into Ezra’s IV. Ezra flatlines. House and Chase stand there solemnly for a few moments. Then House looks at his watch. House grabs the bed and pulls it away from the wall.]
Getting a laryngoscope. [House grabs a laryngoscope.] Don’t just stand there, help.
[Interrupting.] Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it’s way further down the list than murder. [He intubates Ezra and starts to pump the ambu bag.] He’s unconscious. No more whining. I’m gonna keep testing him. [Chase looks confused and indignant.] Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night.
We can legally assume that he’d consent to whatever a reasonable person would consent to. [Cut to House’s office.]
[Fake exasperation with a *hint* of real exasperation.] I try to kill him, you’re mad. I don’t kill him you’re mad.
Were you in that room with him? Was he wearing a tux while he was choking on his own plasma? Keep doing the tests. Take your time, do it right. Go. [Turns to look at the MRI.] Get to work. [House studies the MRI for a couple of seconds, obviously expecting the ducklings to go do his bidding.] Wait! [He turns in his chair. Ducklings haven’t moved, and House is a twinge embarrassed for yelling, but tries not to let it show.] Cameron, why’d you do these cuts so far down on this MRI of his head?
You also caught the top of his lungs. There’s scarring. [Cameron is staring at him.] You do know that you can’t really pierce me with your stares.
He can kill himself after we get him better. Start him on an IVIG for the Lupus, and get a colonoscopy. Lupus could be hiding there.
Drama queen.
Thought you were only supposed to put on a pound a week during your last trimester.
[Makes a drawn out whining sound.] Not really a stunt. More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink.
Ok. Lying is sometimes good, right? Like when you’re trying to teach someone a lesson about humility, or something. All I’m trying to do is save his life. He’s not gonna learn anything; I just thought the same principle might apply.
I coulda just let him die.
Well, we could; we completely disregarded his wishes.
It is comforting.
[Raises voice, speaking into her lapel pin as though it is a microphone.] How right you are, Dr. Cuddy! We also don’t pad our bills, swipe samples from the pharmacy, or fantasize about the teenage daughters of our patients, either.
Yeah. [Walks away.] We really should spend some time talking about that. [Cuddy sighs.]
[Sighs.] So we know it’s not Lupus. What else could it be?
Gonna need an open lung biopsy to confirm. [House goes into a lounge; Chase and Foreman follow.]
Unless you’ve invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.
When you searched Dr. Powell’s office, did you find a copy of the January, 1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal?
I just figured, if you’re not doing any work, you might like something to pass the time. Centerfold’s a killer. [House walks away, leaving Cameron curious.]
[Fake cheering of an audience. Wilson enters.]
It hurts. [Sighs.] It’s gonna keep on hurting. You gonna keep on asking?
Resting comfortably.
I hate practicing medicine in high school.
I know what he was asking for; I just said ‘no’.
To patients that I knew were terminal.
If we’re gonna keep refusing to cure patients just to rein in my ego then we might start having a little problem with patient recruitment. [House’s pager goes off.]
[Leaving.] I’m a cripple, remember. Accommodations must be made.
Didn’t you find it interesting?
He was curious.
He wasn’t doing anything his peers weren’t doing.
He ignored the rights of the few to save many.
Doesn’t matter what I think. It’s what you think that’s relevant.
If he had control of his own body, he’d be dead.
No you can’t! You either help him live, or you help him die; you can’t have it both ways. [Chase looks up at House from the operating room and shakes his head.]
Well I guess it’s not IPF. [Ezra’s heart monitor starts beeping.]
Well, maybe he’ll die right now. Make everything easy for all of us. [He leaves and Cameron is alone in the observation room.]
No breath sounds on the right side; he’s dropped his right lung. [Removes stethoscope.] Air’s building up in his chest, compressing his heart. [House makes an incision in Ezra, and places a chest tube in him, which re-inflates the lung.]
Withdraws from pain stimuli on the left side, but not the right.
Or he’s lost sensation in some places.
Only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.
Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer and check his deep tendon reflexes.
[Long blink, thinking.] Only one more way to tell. Pupillary reflexes.
See, I was right; only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.
So wake him up. [House leaves.]
Don’t go towards the light. You’ll fall and break your hip.
You took a little nap.
[Interrupting.] Sorry, little deaf in one ear. Your bone marrow was hypocellular; we ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis, but it looks like it could be attacking your nerves.
We need to attach some sensors to your skin.
Look, we can’t do what you want; we’ve assigned a nurse to watch you so you can’t do it either. So, you might as well just let us do the test.
Oh, get over yourself. The ventilator puffed up your lungs; you’ll be fine for a few hours. Just let us run the tests. [Ezra rips off some leads that were attached to him.]
Ok. But first, let’s clean you up a little. [He grabs a glass of water and splashes a few drops of it on Ezra’s chest.] That feel nice?
Just cleaning him up. What’s it look like? [He walks over to the end of Ezra’s bed, lifts up the sheet and sticks his head behind it.] Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. House runs his thumb down Ezra’s right foot, and there is no reaction. He does the same to his left, and this time the foot twitches.]
Okay, I’m going already. Can’t you see I’m a cripple? [House leaves.]
I was right; whatever is attacking his lungs is attacking his nerves.
No sensation in the left leg, abdomen, right arm. Technology’s overrated.
And bone marrow.
All potentially treatable. Question is which. We need to catch the little bastards in the act. What’s the largest organ?
We need to get a piece. [House leaves them standing there.]
I want you to get a skin sample for a biopsy.
[Walking towards the desk.] Kawasaki’s disease, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis are all treatable.
But you do; you know everything.
[Slams cane down on desk.] Exactly! You can’t decide if we’re helping or hurting him; if he’s good or bad; or if you want paper, plastic, or a burlap sack. Do your damn job. [House starts to leave.]
Fine, tell the truth. Just get me a pound of flesh.
Not as good as you think I am.
Yeah, right. He’s moving it on the street, isn’t he?
[He stops and thinks.] I plan to. In a couple of years.
Felt his glands, too. [Ali gives a slight laugh.]
Yeah. Me too.
Congo red.
What the hell else would I mean by ‘Congo red?’
An abnormal protein is building up inside the cells of his body; shutting down his organs one by one. Explains everything; the infiltrates on the x-ray, the bone marrow, kidney failure.
It did.
We didn’t push him hard enough. [To Chase.] Add the stain; let’s find out.
Change the polarization of the light, already. [Results confirm that it is amyloidosis.]
[Interrupting.] Not outta mine. I had a muse.
You have amyloidosis; it’s in your lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, and brain.
If I was lying, I wouldn’t tell you the subtype is AA. It’s terminal.
[Shakes his head a little.] No. I just got in.
If I did, would you really wanna know? [Cuddy nods and then leaves.]
[Puts his hand on her shoulder.] I’m proud of you.
10-yr-old boy screams for his life for no reason.
And he went to 3 different doctors who all said just that.
Or it's something medical sounding like dysesthesia. Parents are convinced that there's something wrong with their son. [He suddenly walks out of the office; the Ducklings quickly get up and follow him.]
Elevator. [He presses the button and waits for it.] Dad was on Wall Street, mom was a partner in an accounting firm, when their son was diagnosed with autism they both quit.
They've studied this kid, heard him scream a million times. Did 10 years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital.
Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.
Down. Stool sample to check for parasites, blood culture to rule out infection and ANA for lupus.
Check the house.  Run a lung ventilation scan. Lungs are in the chest too, right?
Of course not, this isn't a veterinary hospital. Zing! [He pushes the door open into the clinic.] Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving--
Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys. [He opens the door to Cuddy's office and leaves them to their job.]
I want my old carpet back. [He bangs his cane on to her desk, she's on the phone.]
I want my old carpet back.
Yeah, my blood. Which makes the carpet part of me, I want it back. I want to be buried with it.
It's my office; it's where I work, where I think, where I save lives, allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops. I want it back the way it was.
I shall not return to my office until every patented durable microfibre has been restored to its rightful place.
[Banging on the floor with his cane.] Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! [Stops banging the cane and looks at her.] Attica?
Hello girl whose name I don't remember but whose dad I treated so I don't really know why she's here.
Right. [He presses two fingers into two spots on her forehead.] Does that hurt?
Of course it is. [He puts the earpieces of the stethoscope back into his ear as she unzips her shirt... she doesn't have anything on underneath. House's jaw drops and he goes rather wide-eyed.] Kinda had access through the shirt, this'll work. [He listens to her heart.]
Exactly when did New Jersey run out of horny 17-yr-old boys?
Can't leave right now. [Turns back to Ali.] Well congratulations, you are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing.
Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.
I know this is hard for all of us but thanks to doctor Cuddy I don't have an office so I have to work here.
It's unusable. So, whatever's bothering him it wasn't his lungs. What about the kid's house?
We already had that discussion. Did we get a fecal smear? [He purposely says the last bit louder to ick out the people in the clinic.]
Nope, Cuddy says I have to work here.
And since I can't work in my office.
Devious. Saw it in a James Bond movie. [Raising the volume.] Fecal smear, talk to me!
Put back my carpet?
Fecal matter, is there a sample we can look at?
Go up his rear and get a smear. Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel. [He walks out of the clinic.]
So what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?
Yeah. So you stuck your finger in the kid and gave him a pleural effusion. [He moves stuff off the edge of Wilson's desk so he can perch on it.] You ever considered getting a manicure?
I said it was a power play, someone answers yes to option A, you don't move on to option B.
I smelled weakness. Get the kid an echocardiogram. [He starts playing with the Zen garden on Wilson's desk when Wilson enters his office. He looks confused at seeing the team in there, the Ducklings look slightly embarrassed. Wilson looks at the name on his door.]
The fluid comes back in exudate; get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Thought you wouldn't mind sharing offices for a while.
That is so not Zen.
So you want mornings or afternoons?
Yep.
Because you're good at that stuff.
[Picks up a random toy.] Is there anything you'll throw out?
So you gotta keep it until she… [He draws his hand across his neck and makes an execution sound.]
[Turns around and feigns surprise.] Oh, 2 East coast time? [Cameron looks resigned.] I thought you meant Pacific, which is stupid of me I guess. [The Ducklings start to get up.] What about parasites?
Oh well, we should go then. [Ducklings are about to get up again.] That just leaves cancer. Get a lung biopsy.
Well I'm sorry, was there somewhere you needed to be?
Carpet?
Nothing to talk about.
Huh. A lot to discuss, china patterns--
Right, couldn't be that she finds me interesting and attractive. Has to be that she's insane.
Well maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.
Is this about the carpet? Do you think I'll back off if you block all my fun?
I'm having fun. I'm not having sex.
She's not dangerous.
She's pretty.
I'm with you so far.
Oh, give her a break, she's not dangerous, she's... insightful. [Cuddy walks away and back into the meeting room. House presses himself up against the glass of the door and shouts into the room at all the business men and Cuddy.] You can't stop our love! [The business men are startled; Cuddy gives an embarrassed smile in response. House looks smug.]
For the love of god, can't somebody shut that kid up? Got people trying to work around here. [To Wilson.] Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?
Somebody you'll never send a gift to.
[He picks up the gas mask.] High test please. [To Adam.] Hey, hey, hey! [He puts the mask to his own nose and starts loudly breathing from it for Adam to see.]
Eating the red berries. [He keeps breathing from the mask and then tries to put the mask on Adam's nose and mouth. Adam isn't fighting as hard against it but is still protesting. House looks very high and keeps blinking a lot. He breaths from the mask again and then tries it on Adam. This time Adam accepts and is knocked out in a couple of seconds.]
No, that wasn't trust. That was self-preservation.
[Tries to get up and unsteadily hangs on to the overhanging lights.] Monkey's afraid to eat the red berries until he sees another monkey eat them. Monkey see, monkey do, that's all it was. Your kid's still just as messed up as when we admitted him.
You have pretty hair.
No, hope is what's making them miserable. What they should do is get a cocker spaniel. A dog would look them in the eye, wag his tail when he's happy, lick their face, show them love.
Spoken like a true circle queen. See skinny socially privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle, and everyone inside the circle is normal, anyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and reset so they can be brought into the circle. Failing that, they should be institutionalized or worse, pitied.
Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading? This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain or your excretions or your grandma's itchy place. Can you imagine how liberating it would be to live a life free of all the mind-numbing social niceties? I don't pity this kid, I envy him.
Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.
Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?
Make yourself at home. So, think maybe Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?
So what's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells, why can one pass through walls but the other can't?
So if the liver cells are damaged...
So if the liver cells are damaged -- it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system. Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, even the heart issues.
Hmm, daddy does seem the type to use a rubber. So it's not viral. [He gets up and starts pacing.] Just leaves a lot of boozerosis.
Cirrhosis explains the symptoms; heart problems, lungs.
How would you know that? Kid can't talk. Why'd you think I took this case? He's not going to give away the ending.
Yes, they are everything you'd want in a parent. Unfortunately their kid is nothing you'd want. When a baby is born, it's perfect; little fingers, little toes, plump, perfect, pink, and brimming with unbridled potential. Then it's downhill, some hills steeper than others. Parents get off on their kid's accomplishments. [House picks up one of Wilson's toys which then says "Bend over and relax".] Cute! They'll annoy you with trophy rooms and report cards. Hell they'll even show you a purple cow and tell you what a keen eye for color their kid has. [Wilson bursts into the office, looks annoyed and walks back out again.] But this kid, he doesn't smile, he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh. His parents get nothing, the right to brag that their kid picked orange juice out of a line-up.
Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.
My parents love me unconditionally. Get out of here.
Liver biopsy?
How's it going?
What'd you find in the stool sample?
I didn't ask what you didn't find; I asked what you did find in the stool sample.
What's the matter? You afraid of the man?
Uh oh, too late.
You're meeting with a Guggenheim in 15 minutes wearing that?
Calcium carbonate, that's uhh... antidiarrheal, right?
Think that's significant? Think hard poops are significant? [Turns back to Cuddy.] Two and a half? Never threaten unless you're ready to deliver, makes you look weak. Thank god you don't have children.
Take a message.
Wow, that's like the one thing that would get me out of here.
Okay, what else do we know?
It's not his liver, his heart or his lungs. The calcium carbonate in his stool.
Or they didn't do it at all. Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.
Forget the chalk.
Yes, and then I said forget the chalk, you must be very confused. This kid's got pica. Take him to a buffet he's going to eat the table.
We're not looking for typical poisons we're looking for anything that he can put in his mouth; matches, spiders, bricks.
Even better. [To Foreman.] Hansel, get samples of the gingerbread house; bag everything.
You can get into a lot of trouble being here.
Yeah, I got that. So did everyone else, they think you're a stalker.
Yes I actually made that argument.
That's the plan.
I'm surprised that tourism isn't a bigger industry up there.
22 weeks is enough for an embryo to grow arms and legs.
Yeah, who cares what judges think.
You are over 10 years younger than me. [Ali makes a face.] I said over.
Gotta go!
Doctor Cuddy, do you happen to know the way to the Icelandic consulate? This young woman, a stranger to me, was just asking directions.
She needed a ride.
After that look I'm feeling a little frisky, looks like you're up.
The frisky it went away.
If I leave her alone can I have my carpet back?
If I forget about my carpet can I have her?
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy; I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient. Continue.
You've obviously never had a bad trip.
Why can't you be more like the other age inappropriate girls who have a thing for me? Just accept me for me. Continue.
What time does he wake up?
Then what? Walk me through it.
I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.
There are two possibilities, either the parents saw him eat the plant or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing blocks.
So what do we do? Nothing? Wait for the kid to tell us? What?
To talk to him.
Ever see your son eat a bush?
Adam! [The boy opens his eyes a little droopily.] Did you eat something at your house, something that made you sick? I need you to show me what you ate. [Adam makes protesting noises.]
Neither can you. [House takes one of the learning boards that Adam has and starts sticking pictures on it as he talks to illustrate his point.] This is your backyard; you may know it as Mel's Diner. Here's your sandbox, your jungle gym, under it is this. [He picks up a photo of the Jimson weed and puts it on the board.] I need to know if you ate this, Adam. [Adam isn't really looking and is still making protesting noises.]
Adam, you have to tell me because if you don't, [He picks up the PSP and shows the game over screen on it.] it'll be game over, you'll be dead.
Show me what you ate. Adam! Show me what you ate.
[At the podium in the front of the room, talking in a spot-on Southern accent.] Come on in, brothers and sister. Welcome to the house of the Lord!
[One of the strangers leaves. House points to the whiteboard next to him on the podium.] We have been blessed with the miracle of a new symptom. Brother can you testify as to why this poor child's eyeball rolled back into his head? [Uses his cane to point at Chase.]
The wicked shall deceive ye because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots, his ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.
It is easier for a wise man to gain access to heaven!
[Back to his normal American accent.] We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment, like a coma, and you've already testified.
So he has 3 tumors and we missed all of them. What's the opposite of a miracle?
You remove this kid's eye he's only going to be half as good at not making eye contact.
You're ugly when you're jealous.
She's even more perfect than I thought.
You say sick, I say freestyling.
Come on, you're not that bad.
Why would you lie like this? Do you not have room in your heart for love?
I didn't believe the kids when they said that Suzie was sleeping with Johnny. Didn't believe them then I don't believe them now, I don't care that Suzie married Johnny, he's mine.
[Softly.] No she doesn't.
It was a medical exam. I was listening to her heart; it went "Greg House, Greg House, Greg House".
Listen to me; do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed with me? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a jail.
I'm saying it 'coz it's true. Inside of us, we both know that you belong with Victor. [She looks confused.] Is there a Victor in your class? [She shakes her head.] Well if you're not with someone your age, you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.
We'll always have Fresno. I'm no good at being noble but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. [He raises her chin.] Now, now, here's looking at you-- [He notices that her tears are milky.] Damn. Was there an earthquake when you were in Fresno?
I ask all my girlfriends that.
Damn.
It's not love, you have spore in your brain; Coccidioides immitis.  California's full of them, they get an earthquake they get released into the air, you breathe it in you get a cold, turns into sinus congestion, aches, weakness, milky tears and sometimes loss of inhibition and judgment. Damn! [He takes up a prescription pad.]
[Hands her a prescription.] You'll probably live. Damn!
Hey! Don't touch his eye!
Like I said, don't touch his eye.
Why isn't he in surgery?
Better not take him in, kill the lights. [He sits on Adam's bed.] He's seeing them all the time.
[Using a light to peer into Adam's pupil.] He's telling us what he's seeing, telling us exactly what was wrong with him, drawing them for us over and over again. Nobody knew how to speak autistic. When I asked him what he ate he even told me that. [He holds up the picture of the sandbox.]
[Peers into the pupil again and now we can see the squiggly lines Adam was drawing... they're worms.] Hello my pretties. It's not a tumor, Foreman, it's worms swimming in his eye. Animal makes potty in the sandbox, boy plays in the sandbox, boy eats the sand, you can probably tell where this is going by now.
Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their human host.
All of it? Worms spread from his gut to the rest of his body. Attacked his lungs, that’s what made him scream and caused the effusion. [CGI of all this as House explains.] Invade his liver sending dead liver cells coursing through his system, it attacked his eye and the muscles surrounding it making his eyeball do a back flip. Laser photo coagulation can fix the eye and high dose of benzimidazole should kill the worms.
Good news, he's going to be with you for a long, long time.
At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk? [Silence for a while as they watch the family.] First tongue kiss, an 8 on the happiness scale. (Possibly harking back to the scale Wilson was talking about in 3.01 Meaning.) Your child being snatched back from the brink of death, that's a 10. They're clocking in at a very tepid 6.5 because they know what they have to go back to.
Yeah I know, see ya.
Children?
It explains the marriage. Who the hell gets married at 20?
Show me a 20-yr-old who's not in love. You get married at 20 you're going to be shocked at who you're living with at 30. [He looks out the glass wall to find Wilson chatting up a pretty nurse - they seem to be enjoying their conversation and the nurse is laughing at some joke Wilson has made]
Who's he talking to?
It’s got an ass, technically that makes it a who.
You seen her here before?
You think that’s funny, ask him about the time he sabotaged my cane.
Something about not getting too uppity with normal folks who walk good.
You sprinted through 3 bad marriages, into an affair with a dying patient - now a naughty nurse? How many more failed relationships are we both going to have to deal with before you learn to love yourself? And I mean that in a literal way.
I know you.
You're lying to me, that’s interesting.
Why is she hanging out here?
She's in Peds, it’s the next wing over.
If he's not hitting that then why's she here?
So explain them. Wake me when they've done an exploratory laparotomy. Anybody know her? Know her story?
Belly pain plus throat swelling.
Got a better idea? [Silence] Then stretch away. Start her on floroquinolone for the salmonella.
Fascinating. Have you considered a career as a memoirist? [He sits down on the stool] Let's see it.
Sorry, I thought you were waiting 2 hours, didn't know you wanted to chat. Hi, I'm Greg. How 'bout that local sports team? [He checks out Tritter's crotch as Tritter pulls his pants down] It’s not an infection.
You want me to touch you? It’s your private place. You're chewing nicotine gum which causes dehydration which causes wear and tear. Try a lubricant or foreplay if you're cheap.
Sorry, already met this month's quota of useless tests for stubborn idiots. [He pops a vicodin]
Wow, you're like a... detective or something.
Please stop, it's hard to write through the haze of bitter tears.
Nyeah, I asked for decrappinated coffee. [He takes his cane and is about to walk out when Tritter deliberately kicks at his cane. House loses balance and falls against the door. He looks back in surprise]
Bend over. [Tritter smiles like it’s a joke]
If you have an infection, you'd have a fever. You're chewing nicotine gum which messes with the weather in your mouth so I need to [he shows the thermometer] vacation elsewhere.
And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. [Tritter tries to look back to see what House is doing] Uh uh, you break it, you bought it.
Leaving early today. [He returns Tritter's file] Did you ever get that thing where you're sure you've forgotten something but you can't figure out what? [Nurse shakes her head] Guess it can't be that important. [He throws away the swabbing test he did on Tritter and walks off]
Why?
Salmonella? That was a total stretch.
Then it was a dumb thing to say, now it's smart. She's got the rash so we know she's unusually susceptible to allergic reactions so that's what brought her in. Probably the peanut butter in her sandwich.
That's because you foolishly tested her while she was lying down.
And getting robbed. Always gets my heart rate up. Give her the same food she ate at the diner and stick her on the treadmill.
You don't think I'm going to get a response?
You're on, 50 bucks.
A hundred bucks? If you say so. [He walks into a room and Chase and Foreman exchange a look before walking off together]
Told you it would work.
We can spend all day arguing right and wrong.  Give me the hundred bucks.
We could spend all day arguing whether we bet or not.  Give me the hundred bucks.
So, psychosomatic?  Panic attack? [House takes Cameron’s stethoscope and begins to break into a locker.]
Mine.  Chest, stomach, throat.  What does it all mean?
I know that.  [The locker opens.]  Oh, that is so annoying!  Wilson’s girlfriend’s left her stuff in my locker again.
Relax, you know they’re going to blame…
Can we get back to the medicine?
So it’s just a coincidence that they both got crippling stomach pains.  Wow, they really are a great couple.  So much in common.  One blue shoe – what do you think that means?
You feeling luckier?
Two hundred it is.
Aha!  Brochure to a jazz festival in the Poconos this weekend.
Four, five, six novels, no music.  What does that mean?
It means she spends her time reading, not listening.  She’d only want to go and watch jazz if the only person wanted to go.  She has a martyr complex.  Issues of inferiority.
Infectious or environmental.  All you have to do is check out parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals, or it’s internet porn related.  I’ll check the internet, you guys cover the rest of the stuff.
That cheating bastard!
Right, I bet he told you that she’s the love of his life.
There’s a reason that we don’t let kids vote or drink or work in the salt mines.  They’re idiots!  20-year-olds fall in and out of love more often than they change their oil filters.  Which they should do more often.
Good.  Now go rub their lying, cheating privates with a cotton swab.
What’s that, you say?  You have a problem with interracial couples?
No!  Haven’t any of your shorties ever been whities?
I don’t care about color.  As long as they can help me breed a superior race.
Sorry, you’re right.  That kind of prejudice is totally fine.
Take the wife off the steroids.  If she spikes a fever, we’ll know it’s an infection.  If she doesn’t, it’s environmental.
He got off easy.  I almost gave him a colonoscopy.
Hmm, only ate half your breakfast.  Feeling a little sick this morning?
I’m a man of principle.  I don’t care how much time and money it costs you to defend me.
No empty coffee cups.  Off the caffeine.  Good for baby.
Sorry, that would make it harder to ignore you.  Can’t ignore that rapidly expanding first trimester ass, though.
You add brain involvement to the chest, stomach, throat, what’ve you got?
Leaving environmental.  What flavor?
They both got it, meaning it’s infection or environmental, and since it’s not an infection…
Maybe we didn’t and it’s sarcoidosis.
Tell that to the clusters of sarcoidosis cases.
If sarcoidosis has two environmental causes, it has environmental causes.  We just don’t know all of them yet.  Husband’s chest.  He has slightly enlarged hylar lymph nodes.  Sarcoidosis explains almost all of their symptoms, including her getting worse off the steroids.
That’s what ‘almost’ means.
Oh, 90%?
Fine, I’ll consult a specialist.  [He climbs over the balcony wall and into Wilson’s office.]
Love to gossip, but I’ve got work to do.  Is this sarcoidosis?
In a way, aren’t we all guilty of bribing the janitor of taking the file and giving it to me?  Yes, I take my share of the blame, but society’s also –
She is so wrong for you.  You know, she filed a form so the hospital would take extra withholding.  Who does that?
I didn’t try to break up your marriages; you did that yourself.
Yes, that keeps me up at night.  That and the Loch Ness monster, global warming, evolution, and other fictional concepts.  Although a big, romantic weekend in the Poconos could change everything.  [Wilson is very confused.  They make eyes at each other, and points to House and himself a few times in apparent disbelief.]
He says it’s sarcoidosis.  Start them both on methotrexate.
If Wilson’s wrong.  We’ll biopsy her just to be sure.
Good point.  Let’s biopsy something safer, like her shoes.
Why?  This guy write with his stomach?
Or to save her.  She’s the love of his life, remember?
How’re you going to stop me?  Call Cuddy?
No, there isn’t!  Not unless one of them wants to die a horrible, painful death.
In a couple days!  Will the guardian convince the disease to hold off eating her brain until we can get the legalities worked out?
Uh, we had a nice chat.  Did you know he’s a Rotarian?  Listen, she’ll die without the biopsy.
Then have Wilson talk to the husband.  Wilson kills people left and right, no one ever sues him.
Nah, probably better to just let that couple die.
Great job.  Why don’t you just shoot him in the head?
They’re dead.  Yelling at you might prevent you from screwing up like this --
Your job was to get me the biopsy.
Two options: biopsy or no biopsy.  He chose the third, no treatment.  How do you even do that?
How much morphine is the husband on?
Decrease it!  Drugs cloud people's judgement.  Cold turkey, you sucker.
Good point.
Did I ask you guys to follow me?
They’ll catch on if they notice that he’s off the morphine drip.  Shoot him up with one of these puppies instead.
You do understand it’s not really a puppy.
How is that unethical?  It’ll lead to a diagnosis!
Which will lead to a diagnosis, didn’t I just say that?
Fine.  Now I’m just going to find someplace safe to hide this, where I won’t be tempted to use it.
If they die now, they’ll never be able to grow old and tired of each other.  [He hands the meds to Foreman and leaves.]
Guess I can’t use that trick again, huh?  [Foreman tries to open the cart, but it’s all locked up.]
It’s a pretty smart plan, Jerry, but I’m on to you.  There’s only one good reason to kill the biopsy.  You poisoned your wife, and don’t want the coppers to get wise.
Oh.  Then you’re just a moron!
Only if this thing hits your brain, you moron!  I can’t stress that moron thing enough.  You’re killing your wife!
Wanna bet?
Dude, she’s in a coma.  Who’re you trying to impress?
I need a court order to biopsy this woman’s brain.
Good.
Less good.
But you’ll accept an apology.
Not really a recipe for sincerity.
Here’s what’s gonna happen: you go brag to your friends about how you made the big, nasty doctor go poop in his pants, I get Cuddy off my back by telling her I humiliated myself, here’s the catch – we’re both gonna be lying.  I’m not apologizing.  If anything, you deserved a bigger thermometer.  [He leaves Cuddy’s office to find Foreman and Chase.]  What’s wrong?
Then that’s what’s right.  You cut the stubborn jerk’s head open and take a slice.
He’ll get his wish.  He’s dying, just not in a way that’s going to help his wife.
So what?
Why does he have it?  What does it tell us?
Good.  Now, let’s hear it again, but now with a more environmental or infectious feeling.
Fine.  Start her on hematin for porphyria.
Take out the dead bowel, it’s all we can do.  And biopsy it.  If Foreman’s right, it might save him.  If Foreman’s wrong, it might save both of them.
Unless he’s been tossing down cans of frosty lactic acid, the bowel is dead.  What we’re looking for is a reason it’s dead.
Nothing’s something.  Forget the isochemia.  Add the edema and swelling.
Probably, not definitely.  Okay, back to the beginning.  What did we talk about?  Anything, I want to hear it all again.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Love of his life.  Don’t you have to wait ‘till he’s dead to make that determination?
Why did they run off?
Kids talk about running off, not many do it.  What was the reason?
How’d you know the dad was racist?
You see racism everywhere.  Maybe he just didn’t like this black girl.
She has pretty eyes.  Forget infectious.  Forget environmental.  Defective DNA is keeping them from making a critical protein, hence the fluid build-up.  Hits the throat, stomach, chest, and brain.
Hereditary Angioedema.  Symptoms fit perfectly.
Is it a coincidence that your sister has great hair, or that these two have green eyes?
Ew, God, no!  That would be sick.  Half-brother and sister.  Different moms.  Dad must have had an affair with her mom.  That’s why he flipped out when the kids started dating, he had it himself, probably why the pills.
Test them for HAE or paternity.  It’s going to take a day.  She doesn’t have a day.  Start treating and see what happens.
Awesome, can I tell them?
Good plan.  You’ve just got to keep them away from doctors, the internet, and anyone who’s not a total moron.
He might be a little vexed that you kept letting him hump his sister in the mean time.
Noble of you to take that risk.  Tell them, or I will.
Where are you going? [no answer] Foreman, you’re not missing a blue shoe, are you? Com— you can’t bet when you know the answer beforehand!
What?  [Foreman leaves, and meets up with Wendy in the hallway.]
If you’ve come to return the thermometer, don’t bother.  I’ve moved on.
Oh, come on.  This isn’t because I was speeding, it’s because I’m Latino.
Sorry, cool jacket.  Only pockets for important stuff.
50 buck ticket.  Is that your way of beating me up, or is that the price for sticking something in you?
I wasn’t weaving, I’m not drunk, you’ve got no reason to –
Does that polite crap ever work on people?  [Tritter grabs him and does the above for him.]
I’m a cripple who works in a hospital.  You don’t think I’ve got a valid prescription?
Excusez-moi garçon! Hello?! It's 11 o' clock. Which means my friend is ready for his sponge bath and I shouldn't be here. Hey! Gomer Pyle! I know you can hear me!
So many great idiot icons to choose from.
Either arraign me or let me go.
What took you so long?
Nothing. [He takes a vicodin.]
Where's your car?
Some idiot cop with crotch rot obviously thought that I didn't treat him with the deference due to a man of his stature. Trumped up a traffic stop, next thing I know I'm sharing a cage with a guy who thinks that showers are the way the devil gets inside you.
I don't think she needs to. [Wilson looks at him and he shrugs.] I'm innocent!
The guy wanted to punish me, he did it. It's over.
I already got one.
Same thing they say about the doctor who lends 15 grand to a friend he knows can't pay him back. [Wilson gives him a look and sighs.] Relax, you'll get it. Where am I going to take off to? [They get into Wilson's car.] Does Salma Hayek live in Mexico or Spain?
If I am, this is one lame hallucination.
If you ever end up in a bar with a Cambridge woman's heavyweight eight, do not accept the offer of an upside-down kamikaze shot.
Fat guy in a coma, I know.
Nope, but the wall between Wilson's office and this one is thinner than you think; which means we need to stop talking about what a pathetic loser he is. Start treating Jabba for Pickwickian Syndrome. His 96 double Zs are probably putting pressure on his chest suffocating him. [He finds some spare clothing.]
For you and me, what's normal for a hippopotamus? [Cameron gives him a look, Foreman looks annoyed.] Get a detailed medical history.
Talk to the neighbors, search the house. Let's see what else Shamu's been up to besides eating. This conversation is over because I have officially run out of clever things to call the guy.
So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night.
Hmm. Well have you thought about, I don't know, not doing that?
Well there's always surgery.
You're not sleeping on some cartilage; you're sleeping on your arm.
Well it is your left, a guy's gotta sleep.
While following my every move is flattering, a single rose on my doorstep each morning would be more enticing.
You going to add that to my list of charges? [He takes out a vicodin and swallows it.]
Is that based on your years of experience arresting innocent people? The way you're going at that gum, it’s obviously not having the desired effect. You're the addict; you're going to be back at the butts in a month. You're just taking out your frustration on me because my meds actually work. Why don't you quit while you're ahead before you end up as a security guard working the night shift at some strip mall?
Apparently Cuddy's widened her sperm donor search to include Neanderthals.
It’s a joke. Like Cuddy would ever want a kid. Or a kid would ever want Cuddy. Hello, that's why it’s funny! Why are you guys here?
[He turns to Cameron.] What'd you find out?
Danish modern and Russian gymnasts?
It's not syphilis.
Because you get STDs from people you trust. People you don't feel you need to protect yourself from. Whatever he has is connected to his gut, not what’s below it. MRI his brain; look for clots.
So do a CT.
Then just start treatment.
Either start treatment or start building a stronger MRI. Whatever you do, do it fast. The longer he stays in the coma, the less likely it is he'll ever wake up.
What's this?
Thanks but I don't need it. I assume you told Inspector Clouseau that I have a valid prescription for the vicodin?
I'm not a pain doctor, I'm a pain patient.
Bump on the noggin doesn't explain the fever.
Referring to the fund-raising funbags by the royal 'We' now?
I specifically told them to skip the boring testing part and jump right to the dangerous treatment.
[Shrugs.] Kids these days - got no respect for other people's property.
Looks like Cameron is going to be having a lot more ideas in future. Who knew that being bloated and bitchy could actually come in handy?
Or we do all of the above. [Points his cane at Foreman.] You check his belly for patches. [Points at Cameron.] You check underneath for sores. And you [Chase looks up.] just sit on your ass.
It’s probably her mom, I bet she's huge. She's from the Midwest. [Looks at the salad.] Since when did you eat beets?
[Picks a cherry tomato from the salad and pops it into his mouth.] Cameron. She's lying, destroying hospital equipment, telling Cuddy off, gotta find out where she got the Fat Scratch fever.
Or it could just be pity, she feels guilty about being born beautiful so she overcompensates by being nice to ugly people. Would explain why she gets along so well with you.
Cameron sees a clump of dirt and she thinks of me.
You started it.
You say no way I say… yeah, no way.
[In his Southern accent.] Looks like we got ourselves a mystery.
Oh sure. Places to go, people to eat.
Did you tell him that statistics also say he's a big fat idiot?
[Bursts out in sudden mocking laughter.] You see what he did there? The patient's like me, the patient's three me's. If I were him-- [House suddenly gets a thoughtful look.] Maybe it’s not such a mystery after all.
Enjoying your Salisbury steak?
And you must be full of baloney. A lot of it.
And Christians. Oh and black people. No one in their right mind comes out of a coma and immediately asks to go home with an unknown condition which means that either you're not in your right mind or it’s not an unknown condition. So what is it? You tried to off yourself?
That's a huge leap of logic.
Then it's a condition you've already had diagnosed or it's something you know you've inherited. Let's see your stomach has the deep-seated feelings of abandonment written all over it which points towards sexual abuse. Well a fear of hospitals; that points to a more specific traumatic event so I'm going to say-- [Takes a deep breath.] your mom, in the hospital with a candlestick. And by candlestick of course, I mean inherited OTC deficiency.
Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?
Leukoencephalopathy?
[Mobile rings, he picks up.] What? When? [He puts it down.] To be continued.
What are you doing here?
In case you hadn't noticed, those are prescription bottles. Now I'm not an expert on linguistics per se but I think that means they were prescribed. [He picks up a guitar lying on the floor and puts it back into its proper case.]
Ever occurred to you that's why I don't miss a day?
Send him home.
Either I'm right and he knows what's wrong, he's just too stubborn to admit it or I was right and it's Pickwick's. Treatment just had a delayed effect.
Being engulfed in an electric blanket of blubber could explain the fever.
He does not want our help, which means he doesn't want your help.
[Finally spots Wilson at the vending machines.] Send him home. [Turns away and approaches Wilson.] What'd you tell that cop?
Nothing as in nothing; or as in nothing to cause him to think that I have a stash in my apartment?
Obviously not.
He searched my house, found a butt load of pills. [Wilson sighs.] A guy's gotta be prepared for a rainy day.
And because I never know when you're going to be in one of your moods and cut me off.
I'm not the one who talked to the cop.
Where's Chase?
Interesting. NF-2 is also inherited which means I was right.
Between the first Pickwick's and the second Pickwick's, I said it was inherited. [Brenda is coming out of George's room and House rather abruptly grabs the patient file from her.]
We have a rather large piece of tempered glass that begs to differ.
Nice audible, Peyton.
Discharge report says he didn't eat his breakfast. Humpty Dumpty didn't get to be the size of all the King's horses by skipping the most important meal of the day. What causes coma, fever and a loss of appetite?
But his stomach has, the food we eat no longer comes from America's heartland, it comes from South America's deforested jungle land where lettuce now grows and lettuce pickers now poop. Get a sample of his CSF before the little bugs that are now feasting on his brain move on to dessert.
So go straight to the source.
So we've ruled out his parents, prostitutes, the arugula - means either--
Or you missed a tumor on the MRI.
[House finally seems to have found his wallet.] Mind? [Foreman steps out of his way.]
To get a 400 dollar butt plug.
He's going to have to get his own. Come on; let's see if we can get this thing figured out by the time we get to the elevator.
Yeah, he's a delight. You don't get to MS with coma as the first symptom, blindness plus coma says diabetes. [He presses the button to call the lift with his cane.] Just in time.
Were normal when you tested it. He's been in and out of a coma, whatever's going on is waxing and waning, unlike his pant size which only waxes. Which also points to diabetes. Test him again, this time add a glucose tolerance test and a HEC. [The lift arrives.]
[Steps in and pushes the button for the floor he wants.] Agreed; except for the part about doing it first.
The butt plug was my way of saying mind your own business; apparently too subtle.
All of which I had a prescription for.
I'm in a lot of pain. This is all because some cop came into the clinic, I was rude to him. This is his way of getting back at me.
His insane reaction to a simple rectal thermometer reading, [He gets a chuckle out of the lawyer.] probably says a lot more about his mother than it says about me.
I'm not interested in a plea bargain.
There is no "this", there's a him; the only thing I'm guilty of is humiliating a bully. I wasn't speeding, I wasn't impaired, I didn't resist and I certainly wasn't distributing narcotics to anyone but myself because I need those narcotics.
That a smile like mine can't lose. [He then pulls a funny face and flashes it at both of them.] What did the test say?
What about diabetes?
So, you would rather be a blind invalid than admit the fact that maybe you might have a little problem with overeating? And by a little problem of course, I mean you've eaten yourself half to death.
I go where the symptoms tell me to go. Right now they're asking why this stuff is the first thing you've ever refused to swallow. [He picks up a bottle of juice and tries to put it into George's hand. George jerks his hand away.]
Grocery stores giving away medical degrees with the free turkeys now? The sooner you drink this, the sooner I get to go waste my time with something else. [He tries to put it near George's mouth.]
No dessert 'til you've finished your dinner. [He pushes the bottle back at George and they both struggle with the bottle and end up splashing loads of juice all over George.]
Just trying to force a horse to-- [He suddenly notices something about George's grip and lets go. He looks at George's fingers and the light of realization comes into his eyes. He grabs his cane, puts the bottle of juice back down and walks out of the room, ducklings in tow.]
Get x-rays of his hands, then bronc him do a sputum cytology and check his CSF for anti-Hu antibodies.
Tell him that lung cancer is in no way connected to obesity.
We're not; lung cancer's got nothing to do with--
You didn't notice his fingers?
Should have pissed him off. He would have grabbed you and you would have felt the bones, they're not just fat, they're clubbed.
So was he.
He's a complicated man.
Nothing. I just got a call from my lawyer, he gave the DA copies of my prescriptions. As soon as they confirm that it’s bona fide, they're going to drop the possession, DUI and resisting arrest. As soon as I pay my 85 dollars speeding ticket and impound fine, I get my bike back.
You guess?
Alright, I give up, who was it? Who in your family had the weight problem?
You care for everybody. You only lie and stand up to Cuddy for a few.
You're avoiding the question.
Almost everything. [Cameron grins.] Wasn't you, was it?
Nope, but it'd be interesting.
[Mouth full, wiping his hands.] This is Vegetative-state Guy. Better company. [To Gabe.] Hey, hey, tell him about those Sherpa’s you dropped acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral.
[Beat, then serious.] What'd you tell the cop?
[Shrugs.] So, everything's good then.
There is no case unless they can prove that either I got the drugs illegally or I sold them illegally. I didn't do the second, you lied about the first. Game over.
Important thing is you keep prescribing the same amount of drugs to me. Or it'll look suspicious.
Nothing. What're you doing?
Chips?
Wanna see something really cool?
I saw you leaving last Tuesday; practically tripped over two guys on your way out. But you had no problem opening doors. It's called Akinetopsia. You can't see things when they move. And since you haven't been hit by a bus, I assume it's intermittent. Probably accompanied by seizures, which made me think that I can set one off by flashing a...
God, I love this family!
Maybe it's inherited.
It's not his EEG. It's his father's. When it comes to cortical seizures, like father, like son.
Similarities are interesting though.
His house burned down; went back in to get his wife. Firefighters found him unconscious three feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated.
Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.
[Over his shoulder.] Check out the home.
DNA?
DNA test again. Try Unverricht-Lundborg and late-onset Lafora's.
Well, not me. I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.
Stop all treatment.
Well, they obviously aren't helping. Given the fact that he's an alcoholic, there's a good chance his liver wasn't so hot when he came in. Anti-seizure drugs, they just pushed him over the edge.
I was hoping you'd know.
Genetic.
We need a better history.
I commend your observational skills.
[Correcting.] Vegetative state. Much easier. This guy's no Terri Schiavo, his brain's all there, he moves around, muscles have barely atrophied, just waiting for a fairy-tale kiss. After I do that, stick a needle in him.
There are reports out of South Africa about a pill that'd temporarily revive someone in a vegetative state. We've all seen Awakenings. It made me cry. I wanna cry.
[drawling] I can out draw you, mysterious stranger.
Be reasonable. There's no way this is gonna work.
I'm risking getting sued. That's the only objection here.
Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.
Whooaaaaaii!
[Smiling.] Coolest thing ever. Any history of seizure in your family?
Liver disease?
Interesting. Your internal clock kept ticking. How deep does that awareness go? Pick up scraps of conversations, do you have a vague sense that the hospital administrator dresses like a trollop?
Or that the new Star Wars movies were a disappointment?
How 'bout your wife's side of the family? Any history of seizures there?
Technically, Vegetative State Guy was woken by... yeah, Caustic Guy.
Gotta get him a steak, before I can ask him anymore questions.
Didn't seem to emotionally register that his son is sick.
It's possible. 'Course always the simple explanation. Maybe he just doesn't like his son.
The delusion that fathering a child installs a permanent geyser of unconditional love--
Yes. Well, of course. That would play into your romantic vision of human...
[Agrees, but...] Except for all the people who don't. Everything is conditional. You just can't always anticipate the conditions.
Quick! What's the kid's status? Gotta get back to our sleeper before he goes looking for the Orgasmatron.
See, if that were rhetorical, it would mean I could just turn around and leave now, which I'm not doing. From which you should deduce...
"Vegetative State Diet". Who gave you your clothes?
Don't worry about it. We use recyclable clothes now. Wear them once, then eat them. Your son's measles vaccination, d'you remember if he had it and what type it was?
Yeah.
C'mon, where you gonna go? House burned down, your wife's dead. Business is sold off. The only thing you have left is down the hall, heading for a liver biopsy.
You have one day to live and you want a sandwich.
State provides it. Who’s providing for you? You got a car? Money?
Take out another hundred, for me. And I need your car.
You'll get it back tomorrow. Two days max. Road trip.
Sure!
How 'bout this? Cops stop us, we lie. You know how to do that. Chips!
All the drugs pumping through his system right now, his reflexes are better than Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s.
[V.O.] So, let's talk about toxic exposure.
[Limping up.] Raspberry cocaine. This house that burned down. Where was it?
You didn't mention that.
No. So, where else did you live? List everywhere, including vacations. Start with when your wife got pregnant.
[Nodding.] Yes.
Well, you're out of luck, 'cause that's totally why I'm here.
[Purses his lips.] Person with the money makes the rules. Or in this case, person who’s friend's the person with the money, makes the rules.
Why would you care about anything I have to say?
No, you're not.
Noooo! This is no time for you to do your thing! We don't care about his state of mind, we don't care if he's happy. [To Gabe.] This factory of yours. What did you make?
So ask me a question.
[To Wilson, holding up a bottle of Vicodin.] Only six left, by the way.
Wilson lied to the bulls to keep me out of the big house.
Who's he gonna tell? By tomorrow night, he's gonna be a mindless stalk of celery. Since I answered that one, by the way, my turn. What did you make in your factory?
Wow! Going right for the closets with the embarrassing stuff. Good move. [His answer.] Yes! Describe the boats.
She shot me. These boats - I assume you use mildew-resistant paint on the hulls?
Paintball. Doctors versus lawyers. Ever take your son to the factory?
[Shaking his head.] No more questions. I got my answer. While dad's in the office, son's watching 'em spray-paint. And what kid wears a mask?
Mercury specifically targets the central nervous system.
Mercury poisoning explains the seizures. The liver's like a big soup-strainer. Soup drains through, chicken dumplings stay. For soup read blood, for chicken dumplings...
Sits more or less idle until your kid pours tequila shooters into his liver. When the liver goes, takes out his kidneys - explains everything.
[Into the phone.] Yeah, it's me.
[From phone.] Foreman, draw blood, test for mercury poisoning. Chase, start heavy-metal chelation while we're waiting for results.
Where is he?
[V.O.] We have been up and down St. James like a Monopoly car. It's not here. Giancarlo has left the building.
Deep inside, Wilson believes if he cares enough, he'll never have to die.
[Scoffs.] And you would know normal.
Maybe your son takes after your side; seizures and an allergy to emotional connections.
[Hannibal Greg.] Quid pro quo, Clarice. [Regular Greg.] Game's still on.
Last ten years. How much awareness did you have?
Oh my God, you're right! I'm an addict. Thanks for opening my eyes.
This is easy. You ask the questions, answer them and make tasty snacks. [Gets up.] Let's go try the casino.
[To Gabe.] Sorry. If I'd known he was gonna be this annoying, I'd have stolen Dr. Cameron's pad and Dr. Foreman's car. She appreciates my brooding melancholy.
[Whiny-voice.] House's house of whining. State your complaint.
Do an echo. Mercury isn't likely to damage the...
[Grimly.] Do an echo.
I was wrong. Your son's still dying. I need to go over every relative you ever had again. This time, forget their diseases, just tell me how they died. We don't have time to take turns.
Give me the answers, you get a big one at the end. Go for whatever you want. Destroy my privacy, my dignity.
Your grandmother?
Your sister-in-law with diabetes. As far as you know, she's still alive?
Your father?
Your wife's father?
That's the big question? I give you complete license to humiliate me and that's the best you can do. Well, okay. Let's discuss the wonder of the human body.
Oedipal fixation. I was seeking my mother's love and she thought that Ben Casey was just the dreamiest.
When I was fourteen, my father was stationed in Japan. I went rock-climbing with this kid from school. He fell, got injured and I had to bring him to the hospital. We came in through the wrong entrance, passed this guy in the hall. It was a janitor. Friend came down with an infection and doctors didn't know what to do. So they brought in the janitor. He was a doctor and a buraku; one of Japan's untouchables. His ancestors had been slaughterers, gravediggers. And this guy knew that he wasn't accepted by the staff, didn't even try, didn't dress well, he didn't pretend to be one of them. The people around that place, they didn't think that he had anything they wanted, except when they needed him. Because he was right; which meant that nothing else mattered, they had to listen to him.
What happened on the night of the fire?
Yeah, sure it's a stressful, emotional question. Suck it up!
How did your son dislodge the tinder?
And the hit-and-run, walking the pissy dog. That happen at night?
Car accident after the Phillies lost. Night game?
Ragged Red Fiber. It's an inherited condition. Dropping things, muscle weakness, poor night-vision. These people seem uncoordinated and accident-prone. Careless. It's transmitted in mitochondrial DNA, so it only passes through the mother. Your wife's family weren't drunks, they were sick.
The kid is a drunk. Thinks that he killed his mother and turned his father into a vegetable. I might have a few shots myself.
Test his DNA for Ragged Red Fiber.
Here's a thought. Why don't we not assume that the test is negative 'til we actually do it.
Yeah. 'S not like he's gonna do anything with it.
We have arranged transplants before when a patient is near death.
Fine. I'll think of something else.
Wilson, get out.
You've lied to the cops enough for me. Maybe I don't wanna push this 'til it breaks.
Pills are the simplest. Hanging has less chance of damaging the heart.
Strangulation's better than breaking your neck. Which means this'll be slow.
[Small shake of his head.] No.
I don't think so. 'Cause you've just asked me that thing about the speed limit.
What do you wanna know?
I wouldn't help you.
I’d want him to say, "You were right. You did the right thing”.
I figured.
[Expressionless nod.] Lucky.
Well, you got a heart out of it. How many organs do want from the guy?
[Beat.] He said you were right. You did the right thing.
How should I know? He's your dad.
You know what I found interesting about this case?
The hoagie.
You thought this guy was emotionally confused and the hoagie was just a mask to hide his real feelings towards his son.
Yeah. Yet you moved heaven and earth to get him that mask with mustard and proscuitto.
All of them. Which means that none of them said anything that I have to worry about. Now, back to the hoagie. You think that my addiction's out of hand? Your need to be needed is so strong that you give people what they want, what they need, what they think they need.
[Trying to be supportive.] They can't keep your money forever.
[looking at the file, loudly] Party of five! Powerful stuff. The OC of its day. Stress explains everything except the itchy feet.
Hmm. Good idea. Ignore the symptoms. Makes your job easy.
Sure. Heart problems, gotta be the brain. Thank God there's a neurologist in the room.
Nope! [slaps the envelope down on the table]
I've said too much already.
No, it's not. But it could be.
[still writing] Nothing.
[finishes writing, sits back upright] How are you gonna learn to swim unless I take off your floaties and throw you into shark-infested waters?
Apparently you can't. Now what's a game without rules? Uhh, no tagbacks, no biting, you get one test each and the clock runs until lunch.
If I'm right, he'll still be alive. If I'm wrong, it's a very cruel game.
[juts his head towards Will] Can I be your imaginary friend?
[to Jack] How're the feet? They still itch?
I don't know. [to Chase] Is it?
What kinda drugs you into?
Clever. Admit the past. Deny the present.
But confiding it in eight-year-olds is okay.
Shyeah! Turning the other cheek's a good strategy in boxing. Kids don't lie because they have trust issues. They lie because they have something to hide. [looking down at Will] Look at him. Sitting there doing nothing. He's still lying.
Spelling test you failed or forgot to...?
Math test?
Fight with the kid sitting next to you?
The other one's probably having sex.
Yet. But when you start, you're gonna lie about it.
Colder.
[into mic] How much dope did you smoke?
Never said it was. [into mic] What about cigarettes? How'd you quit? Gum? Patch? Hypnosis?
[to Foreman] He went from two packs to nothing. Cold turkey.
Or we could just make small talk. You still seeing that nurse in Paeds? I just don't think she's right for you. You need someone detached, calculating, ambitious. You need yourself in a skirt.
Hmm. Interesting. Sounds like one of those symptom thingies.
Never said it was.
[exaggerated shivering] Brrr! Ice-cold.
Yeah. [to Cameron] Why did that other doctor look at his brain?
So because you think a spasm causes heart attacks, you're gonna induce another spasm? [to Jack] Did you consent to this?
Your meds don't seem to be doing anything. So either you're wrong... or his system hasn't been pushed enough to set anything off.
Heart rate's up. Nothing else.
Still no spasm.
[mock-scolding] Can't you see his heart is fine?! Stop torturing him! What kind of doctor are you?
Why so sad? Still a chance that Chase got it right.
Ohh! That was suspenseful for about two seconds.
Blood culture was negative for bacteria.
[stroking his stubble] Hmm! I wonder who could've ordered that extra test? Must be somebody who knew what persistent vomiting, sudden distaste for nicotine and itchy feet have in common.
No, but as Chase so deftly pointed out earlier, puking does. And Hep-A explains the puking. If this had been real-life, instead of just games...
But who's gonna prescribe my Vicodin?
Relax. Tritter's just getting desperate. He's got no real evidence. He's trying to squeeze you into ratting.
They'll be fine. Also your cancer medicine sucks anyway.
[looking at the envelope in his hand] Suddenly this doesn't seem nearly as dramatic.
Go pump IVIG into the kid. Cure him and get him out of here.
So, we cured the Hep-A, something else pops up. Interesting.
What infections cause DIC?
rubbing his shoulder] Hurt my shoulder playing Fantasy Football.
Should we discuss what causes DIC or should we just send the kid back to his miserable life?
Right. He's thrilled that his parents are dead and his life is over.
Take Cameron. [to her] Your idea was dumb anyway.
Chase, I need you to head back to that "cesspool" and get me the kid's puke. [rubs his shoulder] Foreman, do an LP and have Cameron run down that potty-party theory.
[shiftily] Let's not discuss this in front of the help.
The amount of vomiting that kid did, would be enough toxins left in his system to show up in his blood. Since he vomited in the toilet here, instead of on somebody, that restaurant's our only source of essential vomit.
No. I couldn't say this in front of Foreman. [pulls out his near-empty Vicodin bottle] I need a refill.
Exactly. You stop now, it'll look suspicious.
Write the scrip.
One prescription isn't gonna...
You broke his rib?
Which means... [a slight cracking sound is heard] Oww!
Fix it! Osteomyelitis. Means the infection's spread to his bones. Which means it's either bacterial or viral and not... [grimaces and yells] Oww! [to the nurse] I hired you to take away the pain. Is there some confusion?
Yeah, that's the issue. Friday night, my cane suddenly noticed it was on the wrong side.
[to Foreman] Can you score me some Vicodin?
How long till the cultures...?
Why do you only do that when I'm talking.
[salaciously] If I know what you mean. [exaggerated wink] Chase you can stop doing that.
[looking back up] Or this kid is a lot sicker than we thought. [to Chase] Finish that test. Should be impossible to get two right answers to one question.
Sooo... we knock down one infection and three more pop up.
I think this game is rigged.
He's gotta be immuno-compromised.
Well, if he's not immuno-compromised, why is he acting like he's immuno-compromised? What do the seizures
What do unexplained seizures and really sick eighteen-year-olds have in common?
[lifting his head up, clutching his shoulder] I'm thinking drugs. [gets up] He's an admitted user. Drugs crashed his immune system.
[putting on his suit] Clean tox screen means there's no drugs in his blood or urine. There could still be drugs trapped in his fat cells from the good old days.
A keen observer would notice that he's had some digestive issues lately.
His weight loss could've burned off fat cells and released the drugs back into his system.
But it's not impossible to make him lose more weight.
That'd be cruel. Just sweat it out of him.
Look at you. Couldn't have sent Cameron down here to this air-conditioned hallway to deliver the bad news?
So he just happened to have a seizure at the exact time that we stuck him in a sauna.
[dramatic] Oh my God! Why're you using that?
No, that's... [shakes his head] that's gonna make your shoulder hurt. You need one of these.
Is he still infection-free? [chucks away the sling]
My point being, did something other than those infections cause those seizures? Means there's something in his head. Scan him.
Well, that was then. This is "not then". Kid keeps changing. Scan him again. Where is Cameron?
I've only got two pills left.
You're prescribing for Wilson. Wilson prescribes for me. Write up the scrip.
Yeah, it's got a badge and everything.
[exasperated] Fine! You're right! What's the correct amount? Write up a scrip for the correct amount.
No answer? That's 'cause we're having the wrong debate. [picks up her sweaty scrubs and hands them to her] This has got nothing to do with my problem and everything to do with you avoiding the problem. You're afraid that if you write me a prescription, you're gonna wind up like Wilson.
Tritter wants to win by giving pain. Do you really wanna be a part of that? As a doctor, how do you do that?
Moaning?
Wow, whattaguy! Theories?
He's teaching prepubescent kids that truth matters, God doesn't and life sucks. I like him. Treatment?
It'll destroy whatever's left of his immune system.
You wanna think that he's sacrificing himself because if one person could do it, then maybe the world isn't a cold, selfish place you know that it is.
Radiation could kill him. Alternatives?
We could choose to say they aren't tumours. They're just pus. Which would explain why they weren't there yesterday.
Exactly. Creates a perfect world for fungus.
Moves in, gets married, has little fungi.
Not a big sacrifice. His life sucks. So let's be right. Go stick a needle in the kid's head. You suck out a liquid, then I'm right and we haven't answered anything. You suck out a solid, you're right. No more worrying about playdates.
Okay, fine! I'll father your child.
First you gotta write me a Vicodin prescription. Just so I can get through the foreplay.
[pretends to think] Uhh, I could probably get through maybe... [tilts his head to the right] next minute or so.
[nods] Yes. Their cowardice is inspiring.
[sighs] I hate writing "Thank You" notes. Would it be weird if I asked Cameron to write them?
[can't believe it] You're hooking me up?
[overjoyed] I knew that cleavage was a smokescreen. You're a genius.
[state-the-obvious contest] You can't pee standing up. Gimme.
Yeah, been training for Pants-Off Dance-Off. Gimme the scrip.
[exasperated] Well, we'll find out if you ever give me the...
Yeah! Just not about me.
I was right, right?
[sighs] Our kid's immune-system has a factory defect. It's genetic.
Not if he grew up in a bubble.
I don't mean a literal bubble. A sweet, suburban bubble, where the mommies and daddies protect their children. They die, bubble bursts. Continuing emotional trauma triggers a genetic illness. Question is: which one? [hangs his cane on the whiteboard] The infections he's contracted narrowed down the possibilities. [writes on whiteboard] Hep-A indicates a problem with his B-cells.
[writes] Eikenella.
[turning to his whiteboard] Not now!
You'll stay.
Patient's dying.
Not in the next hour.
What does the syphilis tell us?
[turning to her, loudly] What does it tell us?!
Why don't we turn it into a race?
Not you guys, the infections.
The infections we're gonna give him.
Each of the possible four genetic conditions is most susceptible to different types of infections.
This is a cocktail of serratia, meningococcis, cepacia and rhinovirus. Whichever germ gains the most ground, plants the flag with its leader, gives us our answer.
Now that's the fun part. See if the meningococcis is King of the Hill, you get to have another seizure. Serratia will shut down your lungs. If it's cepacia, you'll have a heart attack. If it's the rhinovirus,... you'll sneeze. [shrugs] Can't all be dramatic. We good?
Only alternative is we guess. And there's a three-out-of-four chance that your little brother and sister will get to cry over another coffin.
Study fractions in school? [repeating] We good?
[conspiratorially] Oh, and this... test isn't exactly FDA-approved. So, just keep it our little secret. Okay?
[mouth-full] Were they seen?
He couldn't find a baby-sitter. On account of not being able to make any phone calls on account of not being able to breathe on account of his lungs filling up with serratia. He has Chronic Granulomatosis Disease. Game over. My work is done.
Bone marrow transplant would reboot his whole immune-system. He'll be healthy enough to win Miserable-Daddy-of-the-Year.
My kids are already testing his kids.
Moronic.
It's a synonym.
_Has_ to protect his brother. Doesn't want to. Wants to run screaming from protecting his brother.
Okay. [pulls his suit off his chair and grabs his cane] Let's get some evidence.
It's your lucky day! I just found another donor in the registry. Perfect match. We can do the transplant, no danger to the rugrat. [puts the red file in front of him] Just have to sign here.
Unless there's another reason you don't want it.
[shrugs] Chance you'd be cured. Maybe you don't want that either. Maybe hanging out in a hospital, getting waited on hand and foot reminds you what life used to be like before you were forced to play Mr. Mom.
But you don't like being healthy either.
This is your way out. Guilt-free.
When he's able to take care of himself, without you.
[quietly] Good for you.
[as he passes Foreman, whispering] Don't pretend you're so surprised.
Wanna go throw stuff on people off the balcony?
C'mon. Mail can wait.
[cynically] Oh good! I was afraid you would overreact.
Kept you waiting for maybe an hour.
Anybody die?
Well, Cameron's available now. Use her all you want.
[rubbing his shoulder] Oh, poor you. Think if you suffer loudly enough...
What do you want me to do? Turn myself in?
[upset] I don't need help!
You're not gonna make _me_ feel guilty about what Tritter is doing... to us. [gets up to leave]
[holding it up] This baby won me second place in the clinic's weekly "Weirdest Thing Pulled Out An Orifice" contest.
You do not wanna know what came in first.
Rhymes with "fucchini".
[with a quizzical look] Where's my prescription?
A cop says "Boo", Wilson shuts down.
You think maybe you're shouting at the wrong person? Tritter's obviously out to get me. He doesn't care...
Allegedly.
But I hurt in an unreasonable way.
Tritter took it.
I ran out.
'Scuse me!
It's never Lupus. [glancing at the CTs] Who's got gallstones, so why do we care?
The Biliary duct is dilated. Probably from a stone lodged in it. Musta caused a nasty case of pancreatitis.
So... she didn't have pancreatitis?
My theory is... vanishing gallstone.
She had it and it passed. Those things travel in packs. Most of them probably hiding out in her gallbladder. Do an ultrasound. If I'm right, take out the organ, so we can analyse the stones.
Sorry, didn't know you wanted your kid dead. Although for a couple of G's, I can still make it happen.
I am a complete stranger, who apparently cares more about whether your kid dies than you do.
You've seen my stage show.
Or a moron for a mom. What can you do?
[pointing to the parents] 'S people like this who killed Copernicus.
Either way.
They killed his spirit. And nobody likes a showoff.
Luckily, Alice Hartman has a dad, who's willing to see reason.
Their doctor.
There's no time.
[singsong] No time!
Am I under oath?
[glancing at Cuddy] My testimony is that this child might die if you don't grant this motion right now.
Won't be as good as the first opinion.
She's not a specialist in this area. Her opinion is worthless.
Simple surgical procedure turns a little girl into the English patient. What gives?
This is my office, I'm talking, there are people here who work for me, but not listening. Explain this to me.
Call Wilson's lawyer. He'll tell you exactly how and why you're screwed. This kid has no history of allergies.
Here's the plan - we do nothing. We while away the time, diagnosing the patient. Stones were calcium, bilirubin and pigment stones.
Kid presented with low-grade fever, mild anaemia. That plus the stones indicates bacterial infection.
We cut into her belly, bad boys escape. They swarm over, colonize the wounds and- Kaplow!- vesicular rash.
Do a scratch test, check for allergies. When it comes back negative, start broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Bullies bully. They don't get a reaction, they lose interest. [menacingly] Now go do what I ask, before I stick your heads into toilets.
[engrossed in his game] What're you doing here?
You passively-aggressively gave up your practice.
Now you're passively-aggressively spreading peanut butter. Big sign around your neck saying "Wilson does not have enough cash for the cafeteria".
Oyyyyeeesh. You're gonna confront me with everyone who's ever used narcotics. Damn, I have to get something to read.
I get it, I get it, I need to change my nightclub act. Need more props.
She can't be. Has to be an infection.
Bacteria got into the scratches in her back.
[picking up the half PB&J; sandwich] Eat this.
Make you better.
Magic sandwich.
[snaps] Just take a damn bite, okay, kid?
Amazing how she didn't go into anaphylactic shock.
Right! She's allergic to everything except peanuts.
If she's allergic. But she's not.
[ordering] Chase! Hang the bag! And grow a backbone tomorrow.
[angry] You know what else shuts down systems? Death!
Luckily, Alice Hartman has a mom who is willing to see reason.
I honestly figured I'd get a different judge today.
[side of his mouth, to Cuddy] This lawyering thing is easy.
Three o'clock! Gimme the pills!
[irritably] Fine! I'll choose. Always side with the angry doctor's opinion. Gimme my pills.
There is no chance...
I'm appealing.
Not gonna be enough. Need to go broad-spectrum...
On the plus side, she could medal at luge.
[mocking Cuddy] Metronidazole - great idea.
Let's not go broad-spectrum. Let's not take any chances at actually curing her.
[loud] No! 'Cause I'm in pain! 'Cause you think that compromise's the answer to everything! I need more pills!
[at the top of his voice] I need more pills!!
What the hell does "reasonable" mean?
You think that I'm not in pain. Then don't give me anything. Keep me away from the aspirin. If I'm in a buttload of pain, I need a buttload of pills!
[still irritable] Which one of you two gave her an aspirin?
Her symptoms fit Reye's Syndrome. Which doesn't make any sense, unless you took aspirin.
She's lying. She's angry. 'Cause you kidnapped her kid. She'll be angrier if the kid dies.
One aspirin! Combined with the preexisting infections is all it takes to set off an atta...
Well, sure. You certainly earned her trust. [to Edie] Where was Alice the night she came in?
She a fifteen-year-old pharmacist? Or is it just some kid from down the street, who needed twenty bucks for lip gloss and couple of Tiger Beats?
Put your kid on charcoal hemoperfusion.
I know what she's gonna say. She's gonna lie to save her business. [flapping his palm out at her] Gimme more pills.
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.
[irritated] You find it easier to lie for me if it's more subtle? Fine!
[in pain, restrained] or we never cured the infection.
[angry] I don't need you to cover my ass! What I need is my Vicodin! [grumbling] Two pills every six hours. Like I'm on an allowance. She's given the cop leverage over medical decisions! What the hell, why don't we get a plumber in here, ask his opinion! Hey Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns who can weigh in...!
Where the hell is she?
[venomously] Told you it was an infection.
[incensed] Well, apparently not! I asked you for broad-spectrum, you put her on the bare minimum! It's a good thing you failed to become a mom, 'cause you suck at it!!
What's good about this rash?
Good guesses! But no.
It's on parts of her body that we haven't touched. She's got a fever of a hundred-and-three. She's in and out of consciousness. But it's not a reaction to anything we did. Our mojo is off the table. Which means...?
Oh! So close. Means thanks to Cuddy's candy-ass approach, broad-spectrum antibiotics are no longer an option. This thing has grown horns and fangs. We gotta figure out what species it is. Go in with a spear to the heart.
[sighs] Okay, you guys are sulking. I don't really care why, but apparently I can't do my job without finding out.
Horrible, horrible news. Wow! I'm glad we didn't let that fester. If she did have Reye's, then it could be varicella or associated...
[irritably] The correct question is "How can it be varicella given that she's not itchy?".
Maybe he just gave up. Start the kid on chloramphenicol for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
Nope.
Either you screwed me and you want absolution, or you didn't and you want applause. Either way, not interested.
What dose did you give her?
[hurting bad] Okay, the infection's morphed. It's moved into her muscle sheath.
The only treatment is to cut away the infected area. So we amputate.
It moves too quickly and we waited too long. We don't have time for a culture.
It spreads, she dies.
[top of his voice, pissed] Right!! She's six! She's cute! She can't have flesh-eating bacteria! It's just wrong! Let's cure her with sunshine and puppies! Cute kids die of terrible illnesses! Innocent doctors go to jail, just because cowards like you won't stand up and do what's required! You can sit around and moan about who's the
I'm gonna go do my job.
One thing about life - it's got qualities.
[disinterested] Oh good.
[couldn't care less] I know what it is. Infection fits better.
Liver's shot too. She swallow a flashlight?
[threatening] Get the hell out of my way.
And a happy go to hell. [To Wilson] What is he doing here? Is he with you?
Already got a lawyer, get out of my office.
Get out of my office.
Right, so I should get locked up in some place I don't belong in order to avoid getting locked up in some other place I don't belong.
Um hmm, and you get your car back and your bank accounts and your precious tumour-ridden patients.
Next Christmas, buy me a sweater.
I was in pain! You need to believe that I've got a problem so that your betrayal has the illusion of nobility, but you just selfishly-- [Wilson is frozen in shock]
[still glaring at Wilson] Get out of my office. [Tritter shakes his head and Wilson looks disappointed]
You're not? [He holds up the cane threateningly]
Those don't work. [He turns around to face Wilson]
[points to one of the decorations in the lobby] Look, there's Jesus, go tell the Romans. [He walks into the clinic]
[bursts in through the door. Cuddy, Abigail and Maddy (the mother) are startled] Woah. Sorry. Just need her for a tiny moment. Small favour. [Cuddy gives him a look] Pills.
Incision looks just big enough for chest tube. Collapsed lung? Someone mistake you for a piñata?
"No" on trauma. [Looks at her forearm to find a clear patch of skin where a circle has been marked out in black] Negative PPD. What flavour dwarfs are you guys?
Yes, but I don't want to be insensitive. [Turns to Cuddy and indicates at Maddy] She's got a bit of a short fuse hasn't she?
Bleb's not a diagnosis, it's an evasion.
Let me translate that into Tolkien for you guys - means Doctor Cuddy's got no idea why your daughter's lung suddenly popped like a balloon.
Give me her chart, and my pills.
Santa needs us. [He throws the chart at Chase who looks up and we see a dark bruise on his jaw where House punched him] Did you get that looked at?
Great. I just admitted a cartilage hair hypoplasia dwarf, 15-yrs-old--
I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual.
Your choice of verb I take it?
Unexplained lung collapse and anaemia. Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic - Cuddy and "idiop" being the relevant parts of that sentence.
Then you'd be just as big an idiop as her. Don't you people know your dwarfs?
The sick dwarfs sure expect you to.
Gold star for Cameron, for extra credit explain to the special needs section of the class why our patient's negative TB test is irrelevant.
The little people love you. [Gets up] Let's go see a dwarf about a gallium scan.
You don't look a day over 4 feet. I saw in the file that her dad was normal size.
Compared to you I'm sure he was huge. Did he have a fetish or did he just fall in love with your long-legged soul?
Certainly curious about the logistics. Did you stand on a table?
She also hates Jews.
Care to go for a spin?
There are no bright spots because the whole thing is too bright. Except for the liver.
Doesn't explain the liver problem though.
Did you guys look at the liver on this thing?
Seriously, look at the liver.
Why not?
Every organ in the scan is lit up like a hundred watt bulb except for her liver which is hovering around 60 watts. And not one of them good 60 watt-ers but an energy-saving--
Lung cancer is a lame diagnosis. Avoiding Wilson is an added bonus.
Not taking the deal. Glad we talked. Ultrasound her liver. [The ducklings make to take off]
Stand up. [Looks to Cuddy] Your turn.
Well I'm obviously not going to take the deal just so I can have the fun of treating a dwarf so I assume there's more to this threat.
That could work.
This is not lung cancer.
You're going to come begging me to save this girl long before I come begging you for pills.
In this drawer, it's a rescue mission. I got it under control, you can leave. [He goes back to jimmying the drawer]
I'm off the clock.
Obviously.
Hmm... medical mystery. Sounds like the kind of thing I'd be good at. [He gets frustrated at being unable to jimmy the drawer] Breaking and entering sounds like the kind of thing you'd be good at.
One theory, one drawer.
Really? I thought you'd be all for this torture House plan. It works, therefore it's good. On the other hand, I don't want to talk you out of this deal by pointing out your hypocrisy so... patient's life at stake, blah blah blah blah. [Foreman jimmies the drawer while still warily looking out at the clinic] Forget about the specific nature of the liver dysfunction, it's irrelevant. Dwarf's problem is global, that's why the gallium scan was bright, it's going to spread throughout her entire body unless you stop it.
It will be. It'll spread through the biliary tree and hit her pancreas next. Stop retracing your steps, get ahead of it. Forget the liver and focus on the pancreas 'coz after that... actually after that, it doesn't really matter what it is because all roads lead to a dead dwarf.
Only an idiot stands between Ahab and his whale. Move. [He opens the drawer and quickly searches but doesn't find any vicodin.]
Ow. There's no bruise or nothing but it really hurts.
Wow, sounds bad.
Princeton-Plainsborough. [He reaches inside his jacket to get a piece of paper] Here's my discharge slip.
I err... I tried that, it makes me nauseous.
Great, I haven't slept in days.
Oh. Is there something else you could give me?
Thanks so much.
How can a clinic have a rule against relieving pain?
You think I'm a drug-seeker?
Well then give me the vicodin.
Because you think I'm a drug-seeker?
No, you said that the policy was to stop drug-seeking. Then you said I'm not a drug-seeker, policy doesn't apply.
Gabapentin works on nerve damage; you're prescribing it for a broken face! Might as well hand out band aids for a severed carotid!
Not by this clinic's definition since I'm neither a moron nor a mindless drone! [The doctor quickly picks up a phone and starts dialling]
Forget it, I'll throw myself out.
Told you you'd come begging me for help. [His voice is very rough and husky]
Give me my pills, or lose an arm.
So give me my pills.
You'd rather kill this girl than give me my pills?
Well have fun explaining that to her itsy bitsy grieving mother. [he slams the door at Cuddy]
[He says through the door without opening it] Unless you've got vicodin, go away.
No pills, no eggnog.
Cut myself. [His left forearm is wrapped thickly in a bandage and one side is obviously still bleeding under it, Cameron walks right in and House shuts the door behind her]
Cuddy send you?
She right?
Cutting releases endorphins, endorphins relieve pain. Can you get me some pills?
Well then you can leave.
Soon as the kid gets cured, Cuddy's got no pressure to fold.
Autoimmune fits better than cancer but lupus floods kidneys, usually attacks them first. Kidneys are fine, right?
Yeah, only it had something to do with the absence of pain. [She's about to put a bandage on] No leave that, I want to be able to pour alcohol on it so I can distract myself.
Kid been sick lately?
You see Abigail's immune system is like a shy guy in a bar. The ear infections - they come in, they try to coax him to... [he sighs in frustration] to hell with the metaphor. You get the point right?
Factor in her age, elevated sed rate, anaemia... it's Still's disease. Start her on prednisone, methotrexates, cyclosporin.
Your plan isn't working. Two days down, one to go. Figured I'd show you how much it isn't working.
We both know that my pride far surpasses my instinct for self-preservation. You want to redeem yourself, give up now.
I've done nothing wrong.
Which makes this your last chance to do me a kindness before ruining my life forever. [Wilson ignores him and is about to take off when House stops him, no longer teasing but talking in earnest] Nausea's bad this time. You write me a script for Metoclopramide so I can stop puking. They'd give me that in rehab.
Well, look on the bright side; at least you don't have to go by Mrs. Zebalusky anymore. That's gotta be a relief.
You hear my diagnosis on the dwarf? Still's disease. Did you ever consider those ear infections or you just wrote it off as a dwarf thing? You sure he's dead because doctor Wilson sometimes misses things.
Right, I'm pathetic. I'm strung out, I haven't slept, puking every hour and I still out-diagnosed you. But I'm supposed to let you decide what's best--
[subsides] Sorry. I'm done. [he starts to leave but is halted before reaching the door]
Picking up a script for Zebalusky.
Yeah, Wilson's busy right now what with Mr Zebalusky dying in agony on account of his metastatic lung cancer and not having the pills to relieve that agony because of some moron pharmacist.
Get your own.
What's wrong with you?
[sighs] At least it's not contagious. [he sets the plate of chips in front of the little girl] Nice bear.
[looks at Cuddy then back at the little girl] It's a bear.
Words have set meanings for a reason, you see an animal like Bill and you try to play fetch, Bill's going to eat you because Bill's a bear.
See that's what we call a faulty syllogism. Just because you call Bill a dog doesn't mean that he is... [House has a light bulb moment]... a dog. [He looks up at Cuddy] We've got to x-ray our patient's leg.
Weird huh?
Willpower. [He pops a pill]
Normal's not normal if you're not normal.
No. [Wilson looks at Cuddy, Cuddy looks annoyed] So how does a dwarf have completely normal growth plates?
Not nearly as many as I'm gonna take. Forgotten how delicious they were.
Can we forget my vices and get back to my virtues? We were missing the fact that just because we called her a dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf. Everyone assumed she was because of her mother and there's no test for CHH dwarfism so she lost an identity but we've gained a symptom.
Oh you guys and your bickering. Cancer versus autoimmune.
Nope, I think it's both. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis - also known as you've got your cancer in my autoimmune disease. The immune component responded to the Still's treatment, led to the short-term improvement, the cancer portion didn't.
Yeah... it's not your fault, the only neurological symptom was her height. Who could have noticed?
This is your pituitary gland and this is the granuloma that’s been crushing it. No pituitary equals no growth hormone equals... about that much. [He gestures with his hands to indicate shortened growth]
Just hormonally challenged.
Your mom's the real deal. You're just a tiny little poser. The recent ear infections caused your body to release a cascade of these same cells that made the granuloma, attacked your lungs, moved on to your liver then hitched a ride over to your pancreas. We can nuke them with a mild course of chemo then remove the granuloma.
Let me see if I can make this clear. [He picks up his bottle of oxycodone and takes out a pill] This pill represents... a pill. And my mouth represents your daughter's mouth. [He kneels down without even a twinge of pain - he's obviously in no pain at all, not to mention probably high from taking so many oxy in succession to each other] We deposit the pill in the mouth. [he takes the oxy and then stands up] You may never be tall enough to play in the WNBA but you should be able to post up your mom no problem.
Your body needs growth hormone for lots of things like... to grow.
Nobody your age likes who they are now.
You like needing help when you want something off the high shelf? Not being able to press an elevator button above the eighth floor, having to smell ass every time you stand in line? [Maddy draws herself up, obviously insulted] You don't need growth hormone; it's just your ticket out of the freak show. [House takes the scan and walks out of the room, Maddy follows after him outside into the corridors]
I'm trying to help her.
Not too tall. Just tall enough to wipe her own butt. [he chuckles at his own joke. Maddy isn't amused]
Higher than you.
Then you're a lousy mom. You want your daughter to be a freak.
[sighs] You want her to overcome adversity.
Then why stop at height? Poke a stick in her eye, imagine how interesting she'll be then.
You and I have found that being normal sucks because we're freaks. Advantage of being a freak is that it makes you stronger. How strong do you really want her to have to be? Tell her what you have to tell her, now you tell her you lied, even if you didn't.
Who's Abigail?
Oh, good. Then the growth hormone makes sense. [He stands up and starts picking up stuff.]
Yeah, I know. Deal expires tomorrow.
You worried I'm going to be popping more pills? [he puts on his coat]
Hey mom, I guess you guys are already up at Aunt Sarah's. I'm sure dad's in the eggnog and you're probably suffering through another dried out turkey. [Long silence] Just wanted to say Merry Christmas. [He puts down the phone and pops another oxy, chasing it down with more whiskey, an explosive combination]
I'm ready to take the deal.
The clock doesn't expire until--
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
I was just going to ask him where he gets his haircut.
Running into smoke filled burning buildings can be a bit disorienting. Fortunately I have the cure, stop doing it.
So could ER nurses who were too busy to notice that a patient likes both hot coffee and cold sodas [Gets up to walk towards his office, Cameron stands in front of him]
In case you hadn't noticed, not exactly in the mood to dance.
EKG showed arrhythmia, probably just a mild heart attack.
Works for me, draw blood cultures start him on antibiotics, Vancomycin plus broad gram-negative coverage.
If you called to see the design for my prison tatts, they're still at R and D.
Not according to my lawyer.
Yeah, you know what else Tritter can do?
I'm not the one who--
I accepted the deal!
Allegedly.
Cuddy. Wanna know what I gave her?
[walking into his office] So maybe it’s menopause.
Male menopause, high oestrogen, low testosterone, explains temperature swings, disorientation, endocrinologically similar to female menopause but without the vaginas and mah-jong tiles. [Walking out of his office again after grabbing his coat]
Blue vision isn't a symptom, it's a side effect of Viagra, it’s right there on the label, which I have no reason to have read except that I'm a doctor, but then...
You mean he didn't tell YOU he was taking Viagra, and I don't care how sick he is, trust me, he still thinks he's got a shot. Menopause causes temperature swings, limpness, limpness causes pills, pills cause the blueness.
Aging's not the only cause, you said he's got burns to 54% of his body, sure it’s not 55%?
Which could in turn cause...
[Going into the elevator] Run a hormone panel, comes back positive pump him full of testosterone and send him home. And stop following me. [elevator closes]
[cuts him off] I'm sorry... You could throw a dart at all the adjectives between arrogant and unhinged and I'm sure you'd hit one that describes me. There's a reason I operate that way... I live in pain. Pain that on good days is merely intolerable and on bad ones will suck the life-force right out of you. Doesn't mean that I've handled this right, actually, means I was wrong.
I'm sorry! You can hook me up to a damn polygraph.
Great, have at it. [Walks out]
No need, you got it under control.
Upstairs this time.
Check myself into rehab. [Elevator closes]
Nope, this is all me. So no slaps on the back? Encouraging words...
I hope this is me detoxing, otherwise I soiled a perfectly good pair of underwear last night for nothing.
Absolutely it's a show for Tritter, and the Judge, unfortunately unless it's real, there is no show. Hey if it doesn't help my case at least I'll go to prison with heightened senses, all the better to enjoy my strolls around the yard.
When I lead the big patient rebellion, Voldemort here is the first to go.
No need, people in my life have no expectations of me, makes all our lives easier.
[cuts him off] Is admitting I have a problem, I've obviously already done that or I wouldn't be here. I've even embraced step 2, I've admitted there's a higher power, may not be a god per se...[Therapist nods in acceptance] but that Andre the giant guy was powerful. Where I start to butt up against it is step 3, surrendering my will to this higher power. I'm sure Andre's ghost has my back and all but my free will, I never leave home without it.
[thinks about it] True.
Pick a colour.
[Sarcastically] You are a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.
I'm fine by the way, thanks for asking! Whoever came up with buprenorphine to wean off Vicodin should be shot. And then stabbed in the eye [Yelling to Voldemort who is standing just outside the room] I think someone needs to adjust my meds!
The cause of the heart attacks isn't internal it must be external, something environmental.
Still must be something in common.
That's the what's, how bout the who's?
Anyone else?
Well then you should be worried about proving me wrong.
You're not my mom, you don't have to keep checking up on me.
Not bad, considering I just learned that I'm completely powerless.
Faulty logic. This big fancy wing exists because some people with money think that it works. They wanna believe that they can buy a better world. This is nothing short of idealised despair, let people wallow in it.
None of this means anything. It’s just nonsensical slogans and platitudes.
What do you think I've been doing?
Right! I should have an affair with a dying patient and move into a hotel.
Thanks, I was running short on platitudes, you can leave now. [Takes a drag of his cigarette and blows it in Wilson's face. Wilson walks out shaking his head]
No I don't, but now that you know the why what are you going to do to stop the how?
Not if you're right. Antidepressants would inhibit his autonomic nervous system, which would only speed up the heart attacks.
Thyroid effect would only weaken the heart.
This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled arteries and a swollen heart, he's a guy who's brain is trying to kill his heart.
[Epiphany] We need Cuddy.
So you can tell her why you need to fry a guy's brain.
Electroshock therapy is the only way to erase his memories of Amy and stop the brain’s chemical attack on the heart.
Cameron. [House goes to the fridge]
[Starts pouring himself a glass of milk] LMNO, PTU, blood thinners, none of them would solve this problem. He's got a real-life harlequin romance in his head, were going to pull out the 1940s playbook. Bilateral electrodes, high stimulus sine wave intensity, turning that dial all the way to 11. It's basic brain chemistry, we interrupt protein synthesis altering the neurotransmitter system, the result, no memories, no Amy, no problem. [Takes a drink]
[To the ducklings] You heard the lady, go plug him in [They leave, Cuddy goes to leave as well] Am I really that pathetic? [Cuddy stops and looks at him]
If I'd pitched electroshock therapy as a cure for broken heart syndrome any other time, you'd have dug in and maybe tried another 100 useless things first. So either you're actually beginning to trust me or... you just feel sorry for me.
Lower intestine with ulcerative colitis. [Tritter smiles] You crash art therapy classes just for the adrenalin rush?
Well don't tell anyone but the photos of smiling people in the brochures, it's just marketing.
Which you have no intention of doing.
So words mean nothing, actions mean nothing, what the hell is left?
[Yelling from across the room] You son of a bitch! [Tritter stops and turns around] What about your words, your actions. [House gets up and starts walking over to Tritter] Gotta get House cleaned up, get him to show some humility, when it comes to actually doing something you prove that all you care about is bitch slapping a guy who refused to kiss your ass.
Yeah yeah yeah, I get it, so you were screwed over by your mother, your wife, your partner, but you keep sending them Christmas cards while you take it out on everyone else.
Good.
Thanks.
Thanks for the update. [House sees Wilson walking in] My next condolence call is arriving, I'll see you guys tomorrow
[Reaches into the bag and pulls out a red tie] Nice.
It's not that nice... I had no business blaming you for any of this. I know you were just trying to help me, protect me, that's what friends do.
Part of the program, if you don't like it I can stop.
[Answering his phone] I told you never to call me when I'm on trial.
Thanks Your Honour [points to the phone] hard to hear. [Talking to the phone] You test for clotting time and LB function?
But it's not all getting there, something's obstructing the blood flow.
It's lower down.
[To the phone] Hang on a second. [To the Judge] Does your voice always get that high and annoying when you're angry?
No thank you. [To the phone] Set him up for a selective vertebral angiography, I'm on my way. [hangs up the phone, gets up and starts to leave]
[Still walking out] Why? I'm bored, there's nothing I can say or do that's going to make a difference here.
They said they wanted me there, but I don't think they liked me. His voice isn't high because of the electrical charges; it's another symptom of menopause. [they walk into the OR] His system keeps getting hit by women's issues, so let’s follow the pattern. What might obstruct the blood flow that's more common in women than men? [To Chase] Is the catheter in?
Shut up and wire him.
[To Cameron] Centre the image in the interpeduncular cistern, keep it moving at 30 frames per second.
The problem is not how wide the road is, it's a guy with a squeegee on the sidewalk, flagging cars. That's what's causing the slowdown, we find him we find the problem.
Go!
[points to screen] There! Mr Squeegee, spinal meningioma, pushing on the nerves to the vocal chords. Creates the voice change and that nerve just happens to live right near the meningeal branch of the vertebral artery, obstructs the blood flow to the brain, brain malfunctions creating false memories, memories cause love, love kills. And we didn't completely screw up; cleaning the slate bought us time to find the real problem. On the other hand, if we'd been better we wouldn't have needed the time. Schedule him for surgery, dig that thing out and he can start enjoying real misery instead of the fake stuff. [Starts walking away]
Detoxing, I didn't know what I was saying.
Excuse me [Cameron lets him go] I have to go to jail. [Leaves]
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
I said I was sorry there's no need to be sarcastic. [He sits down, Velez, shows Cuddy a book]
So should I be looking for you in the shadows? Flinch every time a car backfires?
So what do you say? How about a conjugal visit to celebrate?
You get these from the pharmacy or from Voldemort?
No... He’d be risking his minimum wage job to do that.
[Sighs] My higher power said it was ok.
Nothing's changed.
[smirks] Believe what you want.
Goodnight Wilson.
[cheerfully] How can I help you this beautiful morning?
[pretending to think] Three. Got a teenage African-American lung transplant... [starts to count with his fingers]
I just said...
Then why'd you ask?
That's dishonest. In refuse to participate in this...
[over his shoulder] Perjurer.
How can I help you this beautiful morning?
Who is here for a runny nose?
It's a cold! It'll get better. Go home!
Those of you who have stayed obviously do not have colds.
You'll be assigned a doctor, who is not me, 'cause I'm tired of wiping crotches.
No, I'm good, thanks.
[calling] Need a team here!
[taking the sedative] Just in time.
Paralytic.
Somebody had to stop the screaming.
Yeah! But quietly.
[to them] Paralytic stopped him breathing. He goes hypoxic, he's gonna be quiet forever.
So, either I can continue to swab people's privates, or I can figure out if this guy's delirium, pain and insanely high heart-rate are life-threatening or just a personality quirk.
I think the latter choice is better for all three of us.
So, pain in his right ear, psychotic behaviour and dizziness. Go!
Because he was dizzy. Means the problem was affecting his inner ear.
He wasn't running in circles. He was running in oblongs. Looked like a three-year-old kid drew them.
'Splains the pain, vertigo, everything. Get an MRI.
What else?
It might not explain everything.
Excellent. Need a complete psychiatric work-up.
[to Cameron] Your turn.
Well, say something else.
[patronizing] Goood...
[seems impressed] Hmm.
[almost imitating an orgasm] Ohhh, yes! Get a head CT, draw a blood culture, run a chem panel and get a complete blood count.
Oh, while you're at it, pour some alcohol into his ear and take out the cockroach.
[collecting his coat from his office] He was scratching that ear right before the event, so I took a peek. My guess is, it started biting.
Wasn't that enough? Pretty gross.
Well, it's either that or I have to keep doing clinic duty. Do the tests or just stay out of Cuddy's sight, I don't really care which.
[shooing away the bug] Because it's not a hospital.
Watching jogging. I sit, I watch, I imagine.
[motioning] That guy's running in shorts.
[smiles in approval] You're good at this.
Beauty of this place is that it's the last place Cuddy will look.
How'd you know I was here?
[getting up] "Ran into"?
Wouldn't've been pointless if you didn't "run into" Cameron.
Breath mint. Thought you were gonna kiss me.
I got out.
Enough foreplay. You gonna kiss me or not?
[amused] You perjured yourself to keep me out of jail. How're you...?
So it's do clinic duty or go to jail.
Then it'll be finish your paperwork or go to jail. Help with fundraising or go to jail. Do your job or go to jail. I think I'd rather go to jail.
Bea-utiful.
Who cares. It's beautiful.
If my lawn was half as well maintained as that, pigeons wouldn't have the nerve to poop on it.
Is that a shot?
[interrupting] You use toe-nail clippers up there?
I am wearing a rumpled shirt, and I forgot to brush my hair this week. You've got athlete's foot in your nose.
[coolly] I'm ready to be judged.
Okay! Fifty dollars...!
...to any patient who's willing to leave here right now.
My money.
[handing over $50 to the dad] They leave, fifty bucks. They're not all that sick. [looks at the people]
If they're that poor, then they'd rather have fifty bucks.
Look. It's monogrammed. He doesn't need money. Ergo, he's not sick.
[shrugging it off] Could be anybody's. Monogram's definitely his.
[melodramatically] Doesn't matter what you say, do or threaten. I will find a way out.
How can we make the sky green? How can we make the tall short? You cannot make the uninteresting interesting.
You're making this into a game for me. From which I can only conclude this isn't a game for you.
Why? Think if I deal with enough people, I'll find some humanity?
I got a bum leg. Say "Aah".
Yes! It's a rash. Can't get any more than "rough".
Well, I could. But then, what satisfaction would you get?
[checking his watch] Start counting.
[two seconds later] How many?
Okay. Either you suck at math, or you're gonna die in two seconds. [waits a couple of seconds mock-expectantly] You suck at math.
Diagnosis! [slaps the file down, picks up another] Prescription! [to Cuddy] You owe me thirty.
I owe you ten.
How old are you?
And you've never seen an after-school special? Dawson's Creek? How do you get to thirty and not know about condoms?
No. But you will. Every patient who comes in here for an STD test has one thing in common. They had SWS. "Sex While Stupid".
[fatigued] How old are you?
[looks up in disbelief] You're lying. That's not the point. You've never seen Dawson's Creek?
And you've never seen an after-school special? How do you get to your age and not know about condoms?
Yeah! You're actually the first one today. Lucky day. Not for you, but gotta feel good for everyone else.
It's Chlamydia. As bad news goes, 's about the best.
Oh, settle down. It's treatable. It's actually curable.
[no idea what to do] All you have to do is take these pills...
[quietly] Oh God.
[seriously] I need someone to cover a patient.
She was raped. [beat] Think I'm the right doctor for her?
Why do you want me?
[shrugging] I don't wanna treat you.
True. 'Cept for the word "just". I'm saying, I don't wanna treat you so you'll see the psychiatrist and because I don't wanna treat you.
I never wanted to treat you. Fact that you were raped [beat, sighs] holds no interest for me. It's nothing personal. There's nothing to treat. You're physically healthy.
[turns] Why?
You gotta have a reason. Everything has a reason.
Ah, see, that's a bad reason. 'Cause I'll lie to you. I'll tell you anything just to get you out of here.
[lowers his head, moves towards her] Look, you were raped. All control was taken away from you. You're trying to find that control again. You want me because I don't want you.
In a very non-invasive, more annoying than trauma...
I'll send in Dr. Stone.
It'll go away on it's own.
No, it'll go away.
Nope! It'll go away.
Or... it won't go away. [starts to leave]
You don't have the hiccups, do you?
[to the nurse] Make a note. Drug-seeking behaviour.
No! Anal-digital stimulation.
How long has Stone been in with her?
You know how many people get raped everyday?
We were to care for every person suffering on the planet, life would shut down.
They deserve our sympathy more than the other people?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa!
Hey! [to the doctor] I paid these people fifty bucks to leave here an hour ago.
Then you owe fifty.
[skeptically] And he could walk way back then. [to the son] Stand up, kid.
How old are you?
And he swallowed something stuck to a fridge? Darwin says let him die.
It's already below the stomach. It should pass on its own.
It's well into the intestines. He's fine. [takes the scalpel and stands] I want my fifty back.
What happened?
[to Dr. Stone] What did you say to her?
What did she say to you?
You must have said something.
You gonna do that again?
You're gonna be okay... physically.
Under orders.
'Cause I don't like hypocrisy.
Which brings us back to, why do you want me?
Tried to kill yourself 'cause you couldn't talk to me. Must have a reason.
[getting annoyed] There's a phone. Talk to a friend. Family-member. Call the police.
[sighs in defeat] You wanna talk about what happened to you?
[sitting on a stool] Talk about your STD meds?
You don't really seem to wanna talk.
'Bout what?
The weather?
You were raped and you want to talk about the weather?
[getting up in exasperation] I'm not gonna talk to you about the weather.
[to Cameron] You'll help her!
She doesn't know what she wants.
Fact that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, should be trumped by the fact that I'm useless at this.
Right. I'll tell her that everything went on without her. Babies were born, people got married. Thousands of people will remember the day she got raped as the happiest day of their lives.
You gotta tell me what happened.
[undoing her binds] Sure I do.
Doesn't have to destroy your life.
Doesn't mean anything about you. Wasn't your fault.
You did nothing wrong. Some jerk hurt you, that's all.
You're worried that you can never trust men again.
Statistically, there was always a chance this could happen. The fact that it did happen doesn't change anything. World doesn't suck anymore today than it did yesterday.
[no idea what to say] Then what do you want me to tell you?
About nothing.
We talk about nothing, nothing will change.
How?
[trying to shrug it off] It's what people say. It's not true. Doing things changes things. Not doing things,... leaves things exactly as they were.
Where'd you go to college?
Hopkins. What was your major?
[has had it] Why do you trust me?
[loudly] That's not rational!
Everything is rational!
[beat] We are selfish, base animals, crawling across the earth. But 'cause we got brains, if we try real hard, we can occasionally aspire to something that is less than pure evil.
[looks at her] What do you want me to say?
She's asleep. I sedated her.
[frustrated] Because I don't know how to answer these questions.
She doesn't wanna hear the truth. She's looking for something. Looking to extrapolate something...
There is no truth.
She's not asking for test results. She's not asking what two plus two equals. She's asking for my personal life experience, so she can extrapolate the law of humanity. That's not truth, that's bad science.
It hasn't been.
It didn't.
Thanks, you've all been a huge help.
Wrong. We just don't know what the right answer is.
Wake up.
'S not bad as what happened to you, I don't think. I don't know what happened to you. And given how lousy you're responding, I assumed it was worse than getting abused by your grandmother.
Parents travelled a lot, leaving me with her. She liked things the way she liked them. She believed in discipline. She was right, I suppose. I hardly ever screwed up when she was around. Too scared of... being forced to sleep in the yard or take a bath in ice. [beat] Your turn.
[sitting on a chair] Never told them.
Usual reasons. I was afraid they wouldn't believe me and I was afraid they'd think I' done something wrong. [beat] I opened up to you, you open up to me.
Oma.
Dutch for "grandmother". She's still my grandmother. And she was still Dutch.
All of it.
You don't know me.
Look, you're overreacting.
Not dismissing you. Saying you're not acting rationally.
[getting angry himself] No. You're...
[softly] Nothing.
[sighs] True for somebody.
[getting up] These things happen. Happened to somebody. What do you care if it happened to me?
[loudly] No! They're out there! Doctors, lawyers,... postal workers! Some of them doing great, some of them doing lousy! You're gonna base your whole life on who you got stuck in a room with?
You gotta get me out of this. There's nothing to diagnose. There's nothing...
I had seven morons who forgot their raincoats. 'S all they asked for, so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why?
You understand? [beat] You okay? I know you're not okay. Are you more or less not okay than you were five minutes ago.
Termination procedure is unpleasant.
You wanna keep the baby?
True. [nods] It's a life. And you should end it.
[looks to the heavens in exasperation] Talk to me, don't quote me bumper stickers.
It's meaningless.
Not to me, not to you. [getting up to pace around] Judging by the number of natural disasters, not to God either.
Yeah! I do do that. What about Hitler? Is his life sacred to God? Father of your child? Is his life sacred to you?
Either every life is sacred or...
You're not killing your rape baby because of a philosophy.
Not as a general rule.
Yes! [beat] The problem with exceptions to rules is the line drawn. Might makes sense for us to kill the ass that did this to you. But where do we draw the line? Which asses do we get to kill? Which asses get to keep on being asses? Nice thing about the abortion debate is we can quibble over trimesters, but ultimately there's an ice-cold line - birth. Morally, there isn't a lot of difference. Practically, huge.
[cracks a smile] This is the type of conversation I do well.
There are no answers.If there are no answers, why talk about it?
You're healthy. You shouldn't be here.
[beat] Fine. I won't discharge you. [thinks] Wanna go for a walk?
Life goes on.
Know why I come here? I sit, I watch, I imagine.
[pointing to joggers] Imagine if one of them would break a leg.
Just one false step. One crack in the sidewalk.
I'm evil.
Sounds like an easy loophole. [beat] People can do good things, but their instincts are not good. Either God doesn't exist or he's unimaginably cruel.
What do you believe? Why do you think this happened?
Me neither. Too bad.
Huh-huh. So God does exist, 'less you get raped. Easier to keep your rape baby for no reason.
He hurts you to help you.
I guess it's better than he hates you.
Because you're throwing your life away.
What you believe doesn't make sense.
Then I can't help you.
If you believe in eternity, then... life is irrelevant. Same way that a bug is irrelevant in comparison to the universe.
[jabbing the table with his finger] Your actions here are all that matters.
So you need to think that the guy that did this to you is gonna be punished.
Yeah. You feeling comfortable? Feeling good right now? Feeling warm inside?
That'll help you? Make you feel better?
The answer doesn't interest me. I don't care what he's feeling. I'm interested in what you're feeling.
I'm trapped in a room with you, right?
Why did you choose me?
[softly] It was true.
Wasn't my grandmother, but it was true.
It's my dad.
I'd like to hear it.
[concentrating more on the game] She terminated it. She's been discharged.
[eyes still on the game] Yeah, it's that simple.
Everyone will tell you... that that's what we gotta make her do. We have to help her, right? Except we can't. We drag out her story. Tell each other that it'll help her heal. Feel real good about ourselves. But all we've done is make a girl cry.
[finally looks up] Because I don't know.
[collecting his jacket] One day, one room.
The only thing I hate more than a thief is a crippled thief.
(interrupting) Who the hell is J. Whitner?
Normal is good. Send him home. (Entering Diagnostics Office.) J. Whitner. Doctor. Who is he and where do I find him?
Just means she can’t bend over. So Cuddy has to bend over backward.
That’s odd.
What took you so long to mention it?
(Looking at scan on light board) Looks like a plumbing problem to me. Leaky pipes.
That’s why you’re going to do a venogram instead of an arteriogram. This isn’t a high pressure burst, it’s a low pressure leak.
So go look under his mattress. See if he’s got any pills or powders stashed with the hand lotion.
Sweet ride. I asked for the one with the sissy bar and the banana seat but Santa gave me this instead. (shows cane) I guess that’s what I get for being naughty.
Yeah. So, looks like there’s been some sort of mix-up at the parking office.
Had to? You don’t look like the type to pull a weapon.
Cane. I think you should do the honorable thing. Let me have my space back.
Cane. Walking long distances makes my leg hurt.
Course not. Pushing that little lever. Thumb muscles must burn. I’m sure the last ten yards are pure torture.
You ever hit a patch of black ice with a cane?
This is about who can most easily cross the parking lot. You’re the winner.
Actually I can. (Makes “serious” face) See. It’s my space and I want it back.
And Whitner’s says she can roll 50 miles between oil changes. I can’t change my leg.
Great. So I can collapse four yards into the lobby instead of outside in the cold.
You know who won the New York City marathon six years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair!
Give me my space, I’ll be happy to roll around in one all day.
Wanna bet?
Nothing that a week off my feet won’t solve.
You mean you couldn’t find the leak.
No. My parking spot is. Blood is only made inside the circulatory system. Which means when you find outside…
Easier than chopping off my legs.
Yeah. He’s also a human being. Which means you shouldn’t be trusting him to begin with. Stop relying on his answers and find some on your own.
Or we should find the leak.
Hey. You can’t yell at a guy in a wheelchair. This is a slow leak. You gotta speed it up. Thin his blood, redo the venogram.
(backing onto elevator) Excellent. Massive will be even easier to find. Pardon me. I guess you guys are going to have to get the next one.
(flipping open charts – the clinic desk is just above his armpit level.) It’s not a clot. You must have blocked the vein with a catheter wire.
Massive clots block veins, they don’t even leak. Since he clearly has some kind of… (puts the charts together, can’t reach the box they go in.)
(to nurse) Would you mind? (she takes them) Boy, that was humiliating. How does Whitner make it through the day?
Lucky for me, I’m sitting in one of these babies. So, what other theories can I shoot down?
His platelets are normal. His PCT isn’t elevated.
Normal CBC and…differential? You guys are still thinking like doctors when you should be thinking like plumbers. Come on, I wanna see some butt crack. Something inside the liver is punching holes in the pipes. Blood bleeds through the openings, sticks to the intruder, forms a mass.
A mass.
Do a CT, MRI, sputum and ACE level. Excuse me, sorry, cripple coming through.
That phrasing means you think it doesn’t.
Good enough for me. (starts to leave)
Mothers know best. Get yourself a sucker on the way out.
How did you know I was a truant officer?
Right. He’s wasting your precious time so you decided to waste mine. How thoughtful. I’m in a wheelchair so I can’t examine him all the way up there. (to Jack) Hop down. My life is just one horror after another. Open.
Nope. (he crashes into table and pulls out a huge syringe)
Syringe. I’m with you. Make him hate the doctor’s office more than he hates school.
It’s just saline. It hurts like hell when it’s injected directly into the muscle. (Jack hides behind mom) So, what do you think? Arm or ass?
Oh, I don’t know. You’d better check. Jack, is your mommy a big, fat idiot? (Jack nods) Well, what do you know! I guess you were right.
Oh, now I’ve gotta slide my butt from one padded seat to another. What if I bump my knee?
(swings into car) Fantastic. Wanna give me a hand here? (indicates wheelchair)
I know. That’s why I said “fantastic.” I was being sincere. Now give me a hand.
It wouldn’t be fair not to. People are good and kind and gentle and help people in wheelchairs.
You do.
Foreman, forget the biopsy. His liver will be gone before you get the results. Start treatment with cyclophosphamide before the Wegener’s punches a hole in another pipe. (Foreman leaves as House wrestles chair into car. He can’t reach the door to close it. Turns on car, backs up quickly and brakes hard. The door slams shut. Smug grin.)
(sits back down) Safe from Cuddy but I guess not from her trusted ratcomplice.
Reasonable people make rules based on evidence. Like difficulty covering a distance – say 50 yards. Not some pre-ordained patheticness scale.
It’s only pig-headed if you’re wrong. If you’re right we call it sticking to your principles. (backs chair into stall and closes door)
That’s what they told Rosa Parks.
We talking about the patient or how to get a raise from Cuddy?
Which means… it’s Wegener’s.
Not everything.
The treatment made his bladder worse, not his liver.
And MRI, sputum and ACE ruled out TB, sarcoidosis and lymphoma. Which leaves us with…
A cancer we can’t see on MRI, CT or blood tests?
It’s not the wrong diagnosis. It’s the wrong treatment.
(doing wheelies) Methotrexate is carpet bombing. Hits everything. We need a smart bomb. We don’t suppress the immune system. We change it. Immune modulation. FT-28. His antibodies are attacking his blood vessels. The irritation causes them to bleed and clot. We change his immune system so the antibodies don’t interact with his blood vessels but work fine everywhere else.
It’s worked for Crohn’s Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Let’s say that he does. And start the treatment.
They’re absolutely right. Stay away from that unproven experimental stuff. Much better to stick with the moving the furniture until he gets better approach.
You mean another last ditch desperation move? You got anything? Go back and don’t take “no” for an answer. What kind of salesman are you?
They got money for tin foil, they got money for whatever you’re selling.
It means that if they don’t trust you, you should earn that lack of trust.
Why should I have to answer all the questions? (wedges Whitner against the wall) Ooops. Sorry, still getting used to the power steering. (Foreman leaves) I assume you’ve heard the news.
My will may be weak but my backbone is strong. And pain-free now that I’ve stopped using the cane. Of course it’s harder to look down Cuddy’s shirt.  But then the vantage point on her ass is much improved. But then that’s just me – always looking on the bright side. I’m the guy who said her c-cups are half full.
(growling noise) No, no, no, no, no. You’re not going to win me over that easily. You may have a wheel. That doesn’t mean you get the grease. You gotta squeak.
(on intercom) What’s taking so long? (rings for elevator)
The spleen is ripped to shreds. There’s gotta be granulomas. Keep looking.
Run his bowel.
Run his bowel.
You missed it. He had a granuloma in his liver.
(standing, wearing one glove and a half-on gown but no mask) Not unless you’re going to sew my hand in this kid’s stomach.
He’s got Wegener’s. Which means he’s got granulomas.
It’s only 26 feet. If he were an ostrich, you’d have a 46 foot wait.
(running bowel) Hang another bag of Ringer’s lactate.
Foreman, hang another bag…
Come on, come on. It’s gotta be in here. (finishes) But it’s not.
Well, it’s a good thing we never sold him on FT-28. His parents were right.
Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots. Spleen explodes.
Or, let’s play tic tac toe. Okay, Xs are bleeds, Os are clots. Started in the lungs, right? What did we do?
(marking a human body chart) That’s one bleed, one clot. Then what?
Whereupon, he peed out three units of O negative. And a bleed.
I don’t know yet. What’s next?
GI tract?
Large bowel is fixed to the abdominal wall. I didn’t run that.
Do a colonoscopy.
You lose your keys, the first thing you do is look everywhere you might logically have placed them. When you don’t find them, then you start looking in other places – the medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox. We need to look in this kid’s mailbox.
Because we need to take the center square to block. (holds up chart)
I like that kid. He’s got spunk. (leaves, followed by Chase. Cameron stands there)
Can’t talk now. On guard duty.
What thing? Oh this? Forgot it was even there.
A bet’s a bet.
You’re right.
Yeah.
Who needs legs when you got wheels. I’m gonna get that spot. (loudly) No way Cuddy is going to gyp me.
I’ll see you later. Gonna have them yelling at me for the next 20 minutes.
This is my last day living the life of leisure. So, are you going to tell Dr. Whitner she’s out of my space or can I?
Because, you said that you would. And lying is wrong.
Which I...
How’d you know about that?
I saved a life. Two minutes out of the chair to save a kid’s life.
I earned that space.
I earn that space every day I limp into that building and do my damn job.
Hey (lurches out of chair and lurches up to Cuddy) You were never going to give me that space, were you? I saw Whitner the other day. She knew about the bet. Didn’t seem that worried.
She doesn’t know me. In fact she doesn’t know anything except what you tell her. And you told her that you were never going to give me that space, didn’t you? Just tell me – do you at least feel a little guilty? If you want to teach me lessons, don’t make commitments you can’t keep. (Cuddy heads toward the hospital, House turns to parking lot. Wilson approaches)
How guilty does she look?
That space is mine. Veni, vidi, vici.
Where’s Foreman?
Somewhere. Very helpful.
Sometime.
Getaway.
(speaking slower.) Getaway. (Wendy looks puzzled.) Get away. (with a disgusted look, she does so.)
Foreman. Your girlfriend wants to know if you’re available for Valentine’s. Act surprised. What are you doing down here?
Take your time. What’s your name?
You have CIPA, Hannah Morgenthal.
We have to do x-rays to make sure you don’t have internal injuries. Blood test to make sure no infections. An EEG for neurological anomalies and biopsy a spinal nerve.
Yeah, and I have seven reasons to think that she’s one of them.
And that’s reason number one. She knew what it was without us telling her. Two, she’s still went from the snow but she’s not shivering. That’s odd. Unless she can’t sweat or feel hot and cold.
Three, scarring around the lip and tongue. When she was a baby she chewed on herself without feeling it.
Four, when you cleaned the wound she flexed into the cleaner instead of away from it. It’s hard to fake pain when you’ve never felt it. Takes an imaginative leap, Ms. Morgenthal. That’s one of them Jew names. Ashkenazys are a higher risk group.
They killed our Lord. Are you going to trust them? She wants to see her mom. If she admits having CIPA she knows we’re not letting her go anywhere without a battery of tests.
I pulled a number out of the air. What, five isn’t enough?
I could hit her again if six aren’t enough. Do the tests. (Hannah sighs, resigned.)
Need to bail on the E.R. I got a case. Why are you wearing perfume?
CIPA.
She’s got no idea what’s going on in her body. There’s gotta be something wrong.
She was in a car accident. She needs x-rays, blood tests, EEG, nerve biopsy. I also note that, although the snow was coming down in sheets this morning, you left your hat at home and used ear muffs.
So, while everyone else was just worrying about getting in, you were concerned with about “hat head.” Blind dates are never a good idea. Only reason to wear a scarf like that is as a beacon to identify you in a crowd.
I need the nerve biopsy.
But it’s neurological.
She tripped.
(leaving) You could have left the scarf at home and just told him you’d be wearing a look of desperation.
So, sedate her.
She’s a teenager.
Well, only until you inject her with a sedative. Then you can let her go.
Seriously?
So, break her arm. She won’t mind.
I’m in pain. Let’s go break her arm.
Nurse Shortie, your biz-nitch, how long are you gonna waste her time.
When you guys are out of this program, Cameron will find somebody. Chase will find eight somebodies. And you’ll be alone.
You’ll date and you’ll date. But you’re the ultimate Darwinian. You’ve got to fight for everything. Anybody else would just slow you down.
Yeah. I can only imagine it’s because she hasn’t given you an excuse to break up and you don’t have the guts to recognize your own reality. (opens procedure room door)
Hi again. I'm sure I can say this without being condescending, but then you'd get the false impression that I respect you so – you're a kid, you're scared, you're stalling. Grow up.
See? How juvenile was that? You can't feel pain. Nothing left but pleasure. Why don't you tell me how wonderful that is?
Better than being in pain all the time. Get in the chair.
Oh God, stop. I'm in a pool of tears here.
Neither can I. Every morning I check my eyes for jaundice in case the Vicodin's finally shot my liver.
I can't run.
Girls can't hold me for too long because I only pay for an hour.
The bathroom's 50 feet from my office. Every drink of water I weigh the pros and cons,
I got shot.
Yeah.
You think I just wanna check out your tuchus, as your people would say. (As she stands and turns to show him her butt, he uncaps syringe and injects her. She turns back and he shows her the empty syringe. Fellows catch her as she slumps down.) Put her in the chair and run the damn test. If she moves again, give her nitrous.
Some think the two are connected.
Wow. She’s actually sick.
No. LP showed normal proteins and no white blood cells.
Nope. Transaminases were normal.
No again. Tox screen was clean.
And biopsy a spinal nerve.
I want to risk paralysis because I don’t know what’s causing the fever. If it’s neurological…
In a CIPA patient. Obviously things are a little different in her upstairs wiring.
Yah. It’s much more likely that whatever it is was cleverly waiting and hiding until you guys were done testing. (Takes coat and starts out door)
You’re all against this, right? And, you’re all going to stand on principle and refuse to do it, right? I’m going to get Cuddy’s approval.
(enters) I need the nerve biopsy.
I had to bring the file. This is the most noncommittal location within walking distance. You left your car keys on your desk. (turns to Don. Loudly) Greg House. You two must have met online. Either that or you’ve got a friend who secretly hates you.
Why would he volunteer that information?
You didn’t tell him that anything he said will be held against you? (to Don) So, what line of work are you in?
Great, my place overcharges. You can’t trust anything you guys say. So, where are you located?
Clean. Normal. Same with the white blood cell count.
Nothing on the scan. I think it’s her nerves messing with the temperature control. Amyloid, sarcoid, there’s a lot of candidates. I want a biopsy.
(leans close to Cuddy’s ear and announces loudly) He seems a lot nicer than that one from Wicca needs a daddy figure dot com. (Grabs a cookie from their table and leaves.)
(eating) The guy with eleven fingers?
How do you not notice that?
She’s not anymore?
I thought we were.
Mmmm. Tranny nurse is more interesting.
No one enjoys—
She’s actually sick.
I was curious. Since I'm not a cat, that's not dangerous.
Thank you. Forewarned is forearmed.
I think if you’d stop talking to Cameron then right now we could be ranking nurses in order of doability.
What did the nerve biopsy show?
Well then, do it.
Why?
And you think I can catch her? (Foreman dashes out.)
This is excellent.
But if you’re going to die a miserable, lingering death, pain free is the way to do it. Are we sure the fall didn’t cause the paralysis?
Even better. The nuttiness and paralysis means there’s definitely a neurological component.
Which is why we need to look at the nerve that you didn’t biopsy.
HIV? Syphilis? She was negative for all STDs. Vascular? No, ANA was negative. Cerebral clot? No, MRI was…
Yeah. I’ll check with an endocrinologist.
Perfect.
Need a consult.
I need an endocrinologist.
Won’t pick up. His cell phone must be broken.
Had to give you the file.
Normal. TSH was on the low side. Is that a cheery fire I hear crackling nearby?
Elevated. 275. Of course, people light fires for themselves. But then they don’t deny it. He’s here.
(looks at her then looks skyward in exaggerated manner) Oh my God. You’re not wearing a bra.
You just met him.
No. But it might be worth taking out an ad in the local papers.
When we met, I noticed…
You left out the third option.  Evil bastard who just wants to mess with other people’s happiness.
It’s not thyroid storm. Get me a spinal nerve.
She just said the girl’s getting worse. You really want to wait? (Drops file on his desk. Looks around, confused.)
(leaving office) It is worse. We’re making it worse than worse? Do the biopsy.
Do the biopsy.
A little further from the truth. We’re talking paralysis. Good chance the spine is relevant. This thing is progressing. It could kill her in hours. (opens door to Wilson’s office. Wilson is reading. House holds out his hand.) Give me back my papers.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If it happened to come from a person with CIPA I could grow pain-free nerves and graft them into my own leg. What an evil plan.
Shorter, but normal.
Medical fact changes all the time.
That’s how medical fact changes. A doctor risks…
This is medically justified.
Biopsy whatever nerve you figure you can safely get at. God, Wilson’s annoying.
Which means it’s secondary demyelination. Which means the source is somewhere else. Which tells us it’s not a nerve disease means it’s something systemic that’s affecting the nerves. Which mean we need to… (to Cameron) Where are you going?
I’ll be right back.
So what?
Yes, immediately after we’re done chatting about saving her life. Most likely causes are metabolic.
Again, so what? Get a nurse to take the kid. There are more than sixty different metabolic conditions that could account for what she’s got. There are only three of you guys.
She should be. She’ll die if we don’t diagnose her.
So, what does the pain tell us?
Exactly. What were they doing when she got the headache?
You said they were arguing.
What were they arguing about?
Peripheral neuropathy, fever and intermittent paranoia. Lots of metabolic conditions can explain those things. But what if we add guilt?
Alzheimer’s can cause euphoria. Pain causes depression. And B12 deficiency causes guilt along with all that other stuff.
We don’t. Give her a shot of B12. If she gets better, I was right.
(entering) Why are you still here?
I still haven’t figured out why.
Just dumped a cool B12 theory. Moved on to leukemia. (drops file on Wilson’s desk.)
I’m not happy. Her white blood cell count was low. But the ones she’s got… Just a whole lot of eosinophils.
Team’s doing a biopsy right now. (sits) So it turns out, the weird lawyer knew that she used to be a man.
Turns out that his previous girlfriend also used to be a man.
Yeah. (reaches over and grabs half of Wilson’s sandwich.)
Is that nitrous? What are you, trying to kill her? You gave her nitrous during the EEG. That’s what made this thing rear it’s ugly head.
B12 deficiency.
Because someone else ate it. Get an abdominal MRI.
See. There she goes. Another paranoid delusion. She’s going downhill. Forget the MRI. We need an O.R.
Her hernia can wait. (he is pulling on gown as he talks. No mask.)
Okay. You can either believe that we really are trying to kill her… or you can assume that she’s suffering from a medical condition. Seeing as this is a hospital and we’re all dressed like doctors and there are easier ways to kill somebody…
I’m going to need iodine, scalpel numbers 10 and 15, forceps and a largish salad bowl. (Hannah continues to struggle as House starts to bare her midriff.) Okay. Hold her down. Come on, weenies, she’s in a cast. Swab. (Swabs Hannah’s belly, hands it back to Bev.) Fifteen.
Relax. It’s just a magic trick. (As he begins to cut her stomach, Hannah starts screaming as loud as she can.) She’s faking it. (to Hannah) We’re not falling for it this time. (Hannah drops her head back on the gurney, defeated.) Okay, keep that retracted. (House works at the incision for a moment.) Forceps. (House starts to pull a tape worm out of Hannah, narrating in an exaggerated 1950s documentary voice) Lake fishing can be fun. It can bring the generations together. (Back to his normal voice) If you don’t cook that trout or perch well, you’ll be giving room and board to this fellow. By free board, I mean all the B12 you can take in.
Not likely. You’d be in a lot of pain. (As he continues to pull the tapeworm out, a nurse snaps a picture with her cell phone.)
Damn. World record’s over sixty.
She’s got no reason to give it.
The hospital will send her a bill.
Yeah.
Where you going?
You're not intrigued as to how a perfectly healthy ten-year-old boy, with no prior musical training, gets into an accident on his way to school...
...and suddenly starts playing piano?
You two shower together?
[to Foreman] Double negative. It's a yes.
[taking a donut out of the bag] Just because it's "inexplicted", doesn't mean it's inexplicable. I want new labs. CBC with platelets, chem panel, thyroid and adrenal function tests. [bites donut]
[mouth full, shrugs] I don't know.
Radcliffe? What was the cross street?
I don't know. You're the one who brought it up. [holds out his left arm and puts a strap over it] Tie this off.
Nice and tight.
You have a blister. You don't waste a doctor's time with a blister. Waste a doctor's time with more important things like the sewer that's beng vented out of your mouth.
[moving away as she speaks] If you could stop doing that, we'd all be grateful.
Nope! But you can stop puking. [removes the strap from his arm and takes out the needle.]
Your lips say no, your gnarly fingers say -- [makes a vomiting noise, like "Uwaah!"]
[to the patient] It's a shame. You look cute that thin.
What tests did you run?
[to nurse at Nurse's Station] I need this blood checked for cholesterol and glucose levels.
Different patient.
[quickly changing the subject] You're using the wrong equipment.
I'm Dr. House. On the off-chance that Dr. Foreman didn't mention it, I have something of a gift too. [to Patrick, beckoning] C'mon.
Your turn.
[nods] It might. [to Patrick] Okay, Patrick. Close your eyes.
What's this? [hits a few keys at once.]
[interrupting] Yeah, all right, all right.
[looking at Patrick] He's great. He's staying.
[to Foreman] Call radiology. I need a Functional MRI of his brain.
I'm not looking for trauma. I wanna see the music.
Well, that's dull.
Would be hugely helpful. Somehow he got rewired as a music specialist. I wanna know how that happens.
His brains doing nothing. Looks like any jerk listening.
Turn off the music.
[over radio] Patrick, I want you to pretend that your leg is a piano.
[gimme strength] I know. That's why I said "pretend". [shuts off the microphone, to Foreman] Kid's a moron. [turns microphone back on] Keep your head still, use your fingers.
[calm] Cool, huh? His heart rate rose.
Then why is there no activity in the limbic system? Unless there's a problem in his heart. Do an echo to confirm. And scrub up. He's gonna need surgery.
[looking up from the file] Unless the bleed happened suddenly. Less blood to the brain explains dystonia. Less blood to the heart explains the heart attack. Scope him both above and below. If that doesn't work, [tosses file on the table] gut him.
I wrote this when I was in junior high school. Could never figure out what came next. And Dimwit came up with this. [plays Patrick's rendition]
It's perfect.
It's nothing. [takes his cane from above the piano.]
You need to talk about it.
You're making a big deal out of nothing. Who else knows?
Sorry, didn't mean to offend your specialty.
Stein's good.
He's given me at least six months. Go to Boston, get the treatment. [sighs] Everything will be fine. No need to talk about it.
[accusingly] You told him.
[pissed] Hey! Okay. You guys have cleverly deduced that I have cancer. You have no right to know. You have no business knowing.
As soon as you work up our patient, who is not me.
I wasn't. Let's move on.
[loud] No!
Okay, we're going to proceed as if I'm perfectly healthy.
You don't know anything! Except, hopefully, our patient on anti-convulsive medication has a seizure.
[perusing the printout] According to the surgeon's report, this one wasn't even close to manageable.
What's changed?
Why don't we make it even worser?
[explaining] We take him off anti-convulsive medication.
Dude can't button a shirt. How much more damage are we really talking about?
Once he gets worse, do a PET scan.
[removing the glasses] PET scan done?
You come for my feelings?
'Cause I left them in my other pants.
Thank you for writing your own. Sure my thoughts are beautifully phrased. [signs it]
Stay away from Weiss. He cries with his patients. Holds their hands as they die. He won't like you.
Your new-found nonchalance in the face of cancer.
Twenty seconds. Pretty good.
Time it took you to go from hard-ass to human being.
You really wanna leave?
I'm not dead yet.
What're you doing?
I know this must be a turn-on for you.
A little whorish to kiss and stab.
I didn't want you to die without knowing the feeling. [yanks the syringe from her hand] Actually, no woman should die without knowing the feeling.
Foreman and Chase's lips are not gonna get to close, [holding up the syringe] now that I know your plan.
[has had enough] I'm Patient Number Oh-Two-Oh-Four-Oh-Six, in the Record Room, under the name Luke N. Laura! There's a whole file of blood there, along with CT scans, MRIs, CSF, everything you need.
[calling after her] You need a sperm sample, come back without the needle.
Hah! Okay, let's assume that I am dying. Which I specifically told you not to assume -- [brushes it off]. Can we at least assume that I'm not dying tomorrow? [puts the scan on the table] Whereas this kid...
PET reveals several more hotspots. But they're non-specific...
[mock crying] 'S the only way I can cope. [normal voice] PET also showed the left brain is working hard...
Wouldn't be worth mentioning otherwise.
Yes! He needs an angiogram to look at the vasculature inside his brain.
Don't get up. I got it. You're busy. Continue.
You know what my team is doing right now?
Trying to figure what's wrong with me.
Thanks for asking. They found out that I'm dying.
[moves a scanner above Patrick's head] Everyone's dying.
Meteor lands on my head tomorrow, it's all academic. I told them to leave me alone. But did they?
No, that one was rhetorical.
No, they did not.
Who the hell were you before you hit your head?
So is "ass", "bitch".
I can probably rattle off fifty much more complicated disgusting ones, but then your dad would get pissed at me.
Like your life?
Your life. Like the piano? Going on tours. Scoring girls left and right.
[oh, okay then] Boys. [shrugs] Whatever gets you off.
[entering from behind] Transduction-inhibitors are a decade away.
[into phone] Hi, Pete! [hangs up]
[interrupting] Stop... trying to save me. I'm fine. MRA confirms smalls collections of blood throughout the white matter of Patrick's right hemisphere. Mind if we chat about that for a few moments?
We need a biopsy to figure out which it is.
Everywhere!
He's bleeding into his brain. He's dying.
[mock-whining] I'm only gonna take little tiny pieces.
'Til I find the problem.
No, I'll keep going even if I kill him. [looks at them, sighs] Then he's screwed. Thanks for the chat.
I'm actually little insulted. You were supposed to spend the last hour worried about me.
But that's why God invented the long consent form. Can you get to why this is a brilliant idea?
[shrugs] Brilliant. Go. Do.
[getting up from the couch] This is gonna get personal, isn't it?
[eagerly] Where do we cut?
[here we go again] Something personal?
And I can't leave because you got something interesting in that file.
[impatient] Can we get to the "but" part of this speech?
[looks at him for a beat] No, you don't. You're just reacting to the perception of my death. You need to put things in order. Fear of guilt...
See? I annoy you. Now are you gonna give me the results or are we gonna... [makes a hug-and-cry gesture.]
[finally getting his hands on the file] Which means it's autoimmune.
So, while you guys were worried about me, half of this kid's brain died. The only solace you should take from this is the fact that... it didn't. Garden-variety EEG sucks compared to the in-brain variety, which is not gonna miss brain death.
Not that much worse.
Not that much worse. He can still talk. He's left-handed, which means his speech is in the right side.
[looking at a model of a brain] What if the right side... is just a little dead. Maybe he has random neurons firing.
You're right. He's dead. Let's go home.
[emphatically] Yes!
[quietly] Shut up.
[almost beaming] Music is a global process. Can't play the piano with half a brain.
Means the right side of his brain has always sucked. Means it's not relevant what's going on now.
Yeah! Question is, what do we do about it?
Not what I was talking about. But yeah, you do that.
[without turning around] Your turn?
[turning around] You mean, cheapen everyone's attempt at a human moment by identifying the real calculations that go into it?
Yeah! I do. [goes back to reading the magazine]
Well, if you're considering grabbing my ass, don't start anything...
... you can't finish.
As long as we're just standing here, you mind if we work? How's the kid's treatment going?
Are you crying?
Not for what I'm gonna do next.
Only if he wants to remain a four-year-old who wets his bed.
There's better. Thanks for the hug. [leaves]
Phone would have woken you up just as much. I can see what you're wearing on the phone.
[closing the door] My patient with the fifty-five IQ has Takayasu syndrome. Very uncommon. Happens mostly in Asian women.
My patient also has a significant seizure problem.
Yes. He kept taking his anticonvulsive medication, he could go back on tour and play the piano.
But... a hemispherectomy would completely stop the right-brain seizure activity and he would no longer need to take his anticonvulsive medication.
[confirming] The right half. It'd be irresponsible to remove the left.
Not my brain. But his, who knows? What? Lets say I'm the left side of Patrick's brain, I'm quick- witted, I'm charming, I'm great looking.
You're the right side of his brain. You're useless, old, damaged.
We go to a bar for a drink. Now, I have the mad skills to be scoring all the hot babes, but instead, I'm spending my time wiping drool off your chin and making sure you don't eat the tablecloth.
I don't know.
Forgot I was dying, huh?
[all right!] I need you.
One small feel for man. One giant ass for mankind.
[like asking for change] I think we should we should remove the right side of your son's brain.
Does he look fixed? Right side of his brain is keeping him walking straight. Other than that, it's been dead-weight ever since the accident. 'F we remove it, seizures would stop completely.
But without the seizures, the left side would have a chance to actually function. He'll learn to do new things. Only bummer, he'll never play the piano again.
I'm not saying he'd ever work for NASA, but flipping burgers isn't out of the question.
No, you're actually lucky. You don't have to watch your kid grow up, you don't have to let go.
He's a monkey-grinder at the circus.
So has the monkey. [beat] The piano is a neurological accident.
And I'm offering him a life.
It's up to you.
I got a flight in three hours.
I don't have neurosyphilis. My MRI showed nothing...
We would have used a condom and I don't have syphilis. My VDRL was negative...
[quietly, seriously] Did you send these results to Mass General?
[pissed] You... idiots.
I was sure it was cancer.
[turning around, loudly] Because... it wasn't my damn file!
The real patient is in the Witherspoon Wing. Feel free to tell his wife he's not gonna die, but he is cheating on her.
[exasperated] I didn't!! I wanted the guys at Boston to think that I had cancer. I wanted the guys, who were gonna implant a cool drug right into pleasure centre of my brain, to think that I had cancer!
I'm going to bed.
Sure. Now that I'm not dying.
He survived the surgery. He's unconscious, but...
I'm not depressed.
It was an outpatient procedure. I was curious.
Not since last year's Christmas party. Whoof! [beat] I know this goes against your nature, but can we not make too much of this?
[protesting] I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.
I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing?
I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why...?
Because... they're boring. [looks at Wilson] Go home to your hotel room and laugh at that irony.
[switching off the penlight] Follow my finger.
You know your name?
Speech centre was on the right side. It'll be a while before he's talking.
[nods] It'll take some time to...
Looks happy.
Yeah, like I could sleep down there with all the crying and coughing.
[Rolls his eyes.] There's no such thing.
Why wouldn't I want to take the case? [Starts opening the file.] The guy's tired and sore, it's going to be chapter one in my... [Stops mid sentence when he sees the photo of the patient and is shocked when it matches up exactly with the sergeant (John) in his dream.]
Never met him before in my life.
No it's not.
I can play the harmonica with my nose, make a penny come out of a child's ear, or any other orifice for that matter; under the right circumstances I could bring two women into simultaneous ecstasy.
What I absolutely cannot do is dream about someone I've never seen before.
True, it can't happen because it can't happen!
Right, just some other guy who looks exactly like him.
There's no record of him ever coming into the clinic so I must have seen him before somewhere else.
He was in the Navy not the Marines.
The guy in the Village People.
I didn't pee.
Male, 34, just got out of the Marines after 2 years in Iraq. Admitted complaining of chronic fatigue, joint pains, intermittent rashes and sore throats. Thinks he has gulf war syndrome.
Because he has a rich uncle that Cuddy is trying to avoid fellating and doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis of Nothing's-wrong-atosis. [Pops a pill.]
Stick to your guns Chase. Just because there isn't a single unifying symptom doesn't mean there isn't something going on. Could just affect everyone differently.
Course not. He's depressed and he's looking for a disability check. Most likely because he's just realised that knowing how to barter for sex in six languages and open a beer bottle with your eye socket are not the most marketable skills.
Because a good scientist continually questions his own theories and assumptions.
Now I'm making you. Do a full physical and recheck his blood for HIV, Hep C, Malaria, Schistosomiasis and T strain A. baumannii just to make sure the VA's dotted their i's and find out every hospital and clinic he's ever visited, every city he's ever lived in and... whether he's ever been on TV. [Starts to walk towards his office.]
[Turns around.] The problem could be neurological, everyone knows TV rots your brain. [Continues to his office.]
Has he ever done any modelling?
[Turns around.] This way. Did you find out about any television or other media exposure?
Of course I care, what a horrible thing to say. Do a Lexis-Nexis search and get a copy of his credit report.
I say before. And I say in between give him a polysomnogram. Sleep apnea could cause chronic fatigue and paranoia. Find out where he went to summer camp. [Foreman shakes his head, House turns around to start walking off but stops, Cameron moves forward.]
Yea just a little too much coffee this morning.
[Sighs.] I wish. [Cameron gives him a weird look.] Wilson was just in there. These guys know what I'm talking about. [House walks off while Cameron looks confused. Chase and Foreman look at each other and then walk off in the opposite direction to House.]
[Hits the wall.] Damn it. [Sighs and chucks the ice pack he was holding into the sink and pulls up his pants, hobbles slowly over to the mirror and grabs a pill bottle. He shakes it and stares at himself in the mirror for a few seconds before popping a pill.]
What?
Where's his mouth been?
Selfish bastard.
Selfish bitch. [Cameron rolls her eyes.]
Who was his last girlfriend?
Right about cancer, wrong about lymphoma. Unless you're simply hiding the fact that his lymph nodes are swollen. Get Wilson to biopsy his salivary glands. He's got parotid cancer, and see if you can get to the truth about who he's been dating, there's no way a Marine goes a year without getting some blood on his bayonet.
Just do it. [Hangs up the phone, goes back to the magazine.]
No hurry. Probably nothing we can do at this point anyway.
He's spitting stink. You should focus on the living. I need a prescription.
For Vicodin, I need alfuzosin.
What? Oh that, I haven't really thought about it. I can't pee.
I can't pee.
I want to pee and not be in pain.
I don't pee when I'm asleep.
I haven't peed in three days.
Very useful, did you hear what I just said?
I'm not obsessing.
[Yelling.] I haven't peed in three days!
I'm not counting intermittent drips.
I passed agony yesterday around 4. [Pops a pill.]
On a bed of nails?
[Takes a deep breath.] You smoke?
[Yelling.] Stop it! [Woman jumps and stops moving the bottle.]
Any history of hypertension? Blood clots? Strokes?
You have OCD.
Any other compulsions besides drinking massive amounts of water?
You get up in the middle of the night to drink?
Then your therapist is an idiot. Unconscious people don't have OCD. They can however have diabetes insipidus.
Different kind of diabetes. This kind is cause by a banged up pituitary. You're obviously more of a lover than a fighter I'm guessing either a car accident or... you cracked your skull on the balance beam.
Easy, nice ass, no boobs, you got palms like a longshoreman. Wait here, you need a CAT scan.
Don't worry, just means you'll be taking two hormone supplements instead of one.
I got relief. I just got no pee. [Pops a pill.]
You didn't come here to talk to me about my pee, what's going on?
Death is probably next.
No way he could've grown all these in a week.
Maybe, but it means some poor sap's getting his melon sliced in the VA for no reason.
Where have you two been?
Wilson's found some fast growing, illusive, or magic brain tumours. What did you find?
Nope. I have them researching my patient.
Where you going?
He's not your patient.
He's dead.
Least he will be in a few days. Question is why? The only explanation is that the VA hospital screwed up.
Yes, why would a government agency lie to cover up a mistake? Might've caused the death of a guy they've been trying to kill for the last two years anyway.
No, it was an antidepressant, I was told to take two every time you walked into the room.
Yes this has proved positive that someone didn't have tumours in his brain.
Why didn't you send his urine to Leicester like I told you?
Why did you choose that moment to listen to me?
Radiation's the only thing that will make tumours grow that fast.
Do it anyway. [Chase goes to grab the right urine sample.] [To Cameron.] And you, call his uncle back, find out if he ever brought his nephew to any hospital parties or fundraisers.
Because... I'm your boss.
I've got a full bladder and I'm not afraid to use it.
[Cuts her off.] SHUT UP! Do what you're told. Cuddy and Wilson may not have to listen to me but you do. [Leaves.]
Unless they were never there to begin with.
Maybe someone else did. Maybe it was Dr. Self-Righteous.
Then they were never tumours to begin with.
No you saw something that looked like tumours. We all did. We were all wrong. Well maybe he doesn't have cancer maybe he has a brain infection that's causing multiple abscesses.
No, they were healed by the antibiotics we're giving him for the vaginosis in his mouth.
I don't know. Yet.
John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you ever appeared in any pornos?
Chronic fatigue, sore throats, rashes, putrid discharge of the mouth, multiple abscesses in the brain, hearing loss and last but not least lower limb paralysis. He's certainly given us plenty of clues.
That's miraculously improving in his brain but getting worse in his ears and legs?
Mm-hmm. You're basing this theory on the negative biopsy, the lymph nodes that aren't swollen or the tumours that were never there to begin with?
It's not depleted uranium.
Who asked for the test when we were thinking cancer, we no longer are.
Not spinal cord cells. At least not until the dose is high enough to kill all his other cells first.
[Sighs.] The sun is radioactive, the earth is radioactive, this hospital is filled with radiation. The issue is not where it is but how much there is, and what damage that amount could cause inside someone's spinal cord, as I've already stated quite clearly...
Give me your keys.
You ever tried riding a motorcycle with a distended bladder? [Wilson throws his keys to House.] Keep him on antibiotics, check his hearing and paralysis every hour. [Starts to leave.]
No... I basically want to do nothing. I want you to keep him on antibiotics and check his hearing and paralysis every hour. [Continues leaving.]
Actually I have to go home now. It's two days past my bedtime.
And I need sleep. Hey it's the brain's way of working out problems that the conscious mind can't solve during the day remember? [Leaves.]
So, where were we?
No. [Gets rid of the remote and walks out.]
Tells us something.
Worse is something.
Did we think it was?
Great, now the fact that he's getting worse tells us nothing. Never thought it was uranium. For all we know uranium treatment is what's making him...
On what? Kind of hard to say what it would have an effect on if you have no idea what's there to affect.
Well next time, go with something that has a chance of working.
We need more information.
It's not enough.
Want to bet?
Don't look at me, I was home in bed.
He's bleeding out.
Fine, he's bleeding in.
He's not able to oxygenate his blood because he doesn't have any left. [Starts to put down Johns bed.]
The only thing that would explain...
There has to be a reason, he needs a transfusion. Get me four units of O negative stat! Now let's elevate his feet. [Pulls John's pillow out from under his head.]
Nobody asked you. [Puts the pillow under John's feet.] In fact why are you even here?
Get out.
[Looks down.] Somebody must have spilled something. [Goes back to what he was doing.] Somebody else should be getting me four units of O negative stat.
It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?
What? [More and more urine pours out of the bag.] It's just urine. It's sterile. No one's getting me blood! [House's nose starts bleeding.] Why isn't anybody getting me blood?
Why are you even here?
No you're not. There got to be a reason. There has to be. [House closes his eyes, there's a quick shot of each of the ducklings, then Cuddy who smiles, then John who opens his eyes and starts laughing manically.]
So, where were we?
Yes I did thank you. I'm guessing better than our patient. Probably due to his BP and hematocrit plunging. [Throws the remote to Foreman.]
The answer was staring right at us the whole time, as plain as the nose on our faces, or the nose on his face.
No hairs and cauterisation scars.
He had it cauterised.
Because it makes sense, undoubtedly done to stop the same childhood nosebleeds that plagued his grandfather, undoubtedly because they were both born with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia.
I'm saying you got a genetic disease that is destroying your capillaries.
Not surprising, since the most common initial symptoms, skin rashes and nosebleeds, are often written off as the result of minor trauma or dry weather. But they can also be the result of his arteries and veins merging together. He obviously has AVM's. [Camera takes a trip through John's chest showing what House is explaining.] An AVM near his spine caused the paralysis. AVM in his lungs prevented his blood from being filtered. Dirty blood caused the joint pain, fatigue and the infections in his mouth and brain. Nothing that a few surgeries won't clear up. Get MR angiograms of the aforementioned. The Marines weren't hiding anything, he was, or at least he forgot to mention his bloody tissue issue. [House leaves.]
There is no medicine like happiness, except maybe laughter, or rubber tubes shoved up your urethra.
It's actually not that bad after the first... I don't know, 9 or 10 inches. Cath relieved the spasm. I'm as good as new.
[Flushes.] Yeah that was my thought too. [Walks over to wash his hands.]
Thank god. Actually it was a triple dose of the good stuff that allowed me to finally get some sleep and solve the case. The pills made all my dreams come true.
I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower. [Walks out.]
I've been thinking about you. You lied.
Like the fact that you lied. No wonder I couldn't place his face. You were practically swallowing it on the dance floor.
Talk about the cool uncle, he donates the money while the nephew gets the write off. Of course by write off I mean he gets to put your ankles...
Because of my t-shirt?
That's very smart, because this way I spent my whole time completely focused on the patient.
What is this some new health plan? You service the Dean of Medicine and you get free health care for a year? [Cuddy smiles.] Why are you smiling?
I'm good with faces. So this plan, is it open to anyone? Is there a co-pay?
Don't make this about me, this is your humiliation. So how much for private room coverage?
Oh give me a break. You hired me...
You gave me everything I asked for because one night I gave you everything you...
If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.
Sorry, looking for an extra large trash can. [Dumps the files and paper in the bin and walks out shutting the door behind him.]
Hi. I’m Dr. House. My boss says you’re important. [Slides door closed.]
Personally I don’t get what’s so hard about making Scarlett Johansson look pretty. Arms out in front of you. [She does so while he gets an otoscope out of a drawer on the other side of the room.] With your palms up, like you’re holding a pizza. Close your eyes.
Dr. Mackman tell you the clot was clear?
And he said you and the fetus are fine.
He didn’t mention your pronator drift.
It means Mackman is an idiot. [He sighs and gestures to the side of the bed.] May I?
So. You take thousands of photos of someone but only one has to look good. Kind of the opposite of my business. [He is checking her eyes while they talk.]
Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don’t look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes.
Unless I can figure out the underlying cause. Puff up your cheeks. [She does and he taps them. They deflate with a slight popping sound.] You should be able to keep the air in. It means there’s weakness around the mouth. So, where’d you learn to self-diagnose a stroke?
Interesting pet name. Most people go with “husband” or “pookie.”
You turned him for a night? Just straight for one date?
A man after my own heart. Different magazine, obviously. [Emma smiles.] I’m rescinding Mackman’s discharge order. My lackeys will be in to do some more tests, take some more blood and empty your catheter bag. [She has started taking pictures of him. He glowers slightly.] Not a moment you’ll want to cherish. [He holds up catheter bag which contains a dark red liquid. She stares.]
Find anything else in the patient’s folder? Like a diagnosis?
So first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?
Any of you guys ever been to the Galapagos?
No. I’m looking for a vacation spot.
How would that differ from your current status?
Visiting family. My uncle’s a giant turtle.
Kidneys don’t often get stuck in the brain.
Heart’s way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney.
No, but if one were to read the history closely, one would have noticed that she had six cases of strep.
Let me rephrase. Six cases of untreated strep.
No one takes them all. They stop when they start feeling better. All strep is untreated strep. What happens when strep goes untreated?
Which leads to, Cameron?
Which is a thickening in the valve of the…kidney? No. The kidney doesn’t have a mitral valve.
It’ll be easy to find. It’s the big, red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat.
I don’t want a layover in Frankfurt, Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario. That’s why I asked for a direct flight to Phnom Penh. [To fellows who have entered] How hard is it to not land? [Back to phone] Does it matter what I answer? Well then, fine, I’d be delighted to hold. [Back to fellows] What’s new?
It’s her job. What’s new?
Nope. Gonna catch me a fish this big. [He holds his arms very wide.] Mekong giant catfish weighs over 600 pounds.
That’s why it’s my last chance to catch one. [He puts phone on speaker and replaces it in cradle. “All of our operators are currently…”] If the mitral valve had been fixed, the kidneys should be getting better which leads us to the conclusion that you screwed up the procedure.
Check for proteinuria and low platelets. What else?
Put her on telemetry.
Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.
You know what would be even better? If we could narrow it all the way down to one. [They fellows leave in unison.]
Either the differential was wrong or she’s faking it.
That’s not quite true. [He exits.]
[Bending down and picking up a piece of clothing from the floor] We wanted to explore all the possibilities.
We’ve eliminated all the possibilities.
Your body is functioning properly.
The other body isn’t. There’s something wrong with the fetus. [Emma looks at him and tightens her mouth.]
Welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome. [As he pulls back to underline it, we see that he has written RORRIM except the Rs are reversed too.] Mom’s body is like an intricate German metro system. All the trains run on time. When she gets pregnant, it’s like a new station opening in Dusseldorf. A bunch of rookies running things, bound to be mistakes. Kids play on the tracks, get electrocuted. Before you know it, trains are backed up all the way to Berlin and you’ve got a bunch of angry Germans with nowhere to go. And we all know that ain’t good for the Jews.
A few things can happen to a fetus in distress. It can become a miscarriage, stillbirth, very sick baby or, on rare occasion, a time bomb that kills mom while it’s dying. The good news is, we fix the fetus, mom gets better. It’s the diagnostic equivalent of a two-for-one sale.
Unfavorable. Is that doctor speak for “dead baby?” You think she’ll be less upset if you phrase it nicely?
If only there existed giant machines that could look through human skin. Mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes.
All of which are fixable. Which would be un-unfavorable, right?
And Dr. Storm Cloud rained all over the differential and killed the beautiful little baby. Heart’s easiest to see, easiest to fix, so let’s start there. When you did Mom’s MRI did you get a look at the fetus’ heart?
So we need another scan.
No need. I’m going to paralyze it.
Let me guess. Cameron.
No, Cameron had concerns. Chase just agreed with her because he didn’t want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug.
If by “sleeping together” you mean having sex in the janitor’s closet.
No, the janitor’s closet at the local high school. [Pumps his fist] Go, Tigercats. Do you have one of those camera-phones? Because I have a MySpace account.
Oh, come on. Let’s gossip some more. I’m sure she’s into bondage. [Cuddy grabs his arm and turns him to look at her.]
Not paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean MRI of its heart. Which we need to save its life which we need to do to save Emma’s life.
That shouldn’t be too hard. Sign here or you and your baby both die.
Oh, good.
The injection goes into the umbilical cord.
Fetus! I’m lowering expectations. It works here and on dates. The benefits outweigh the risks and the paralytic will wear off in an hour. Okay?
[whispers] Fetus. Hold this.
There’s only room for one. Though I could scooch over.
Couldn’t agree more. What goes on in the privacy of a janitor’s closet is nobody’s business except –
I was actually hoping she’d fire one of you.
Trying to avoid altitude sickness. Couldn’t score a direct flight to Cambodia so I decided to scale Argentina’s infamous Mount Aconcagua
There’s a tribe of Macovi Indians who actually carry the elders up –
I’m an insane genius. Set the chamber to low pressure instead of high. Thinner air builds up extra red blood cells. Creates new capillaries. Few more days in here and I can save myself six weeks in base camp. Where’s my MRI? [Cameron slams down the phone.]
Well, you’re trying to be me so I thought I’d try to be you.
But I have a much tighter ass. You think every day should be naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron? [She reaches over and turns off the computer monitor. He sticks out his hand for the test results.] Let me see the results of the bladder tap.
They’re gonna to be inconclusive.
Fetus doesn’t pee, amniotic fluid should be low. Mom’s level is fine.
Either way, your test will be inconclusive. The urine you collected has been sitting in that fetus’ bladder for weeks. And, as my pappy always said, “stale pee is useless pee.”
Just as useless. Old urine drops down from the kidney right after the first tap ‘cause it’s all backed up. Bladder tap number three will give you the freshest pee and it’s when you’ll find out if this fetus has even a fighting chance.
Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps?
Because she takes pictures? Or because she’s you? Woman in her forties. Single. Using a turkey baster as a last gasp of motherhood. And you want to make sure she succeeds, so you’ll still have hope. Can’t be a good doctor if you’re not objective.
I don’t want it.
To humiliate you.
I don’t want it. Your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation.
[big sigh] Figures. Just booked my trip to Johnston Straight.
Apparently I’d have to live with the Macovi Indians for twenty years before they’d consider me an elder.  [He tosses his sunglasses on his desk.] I decided to go kayaking with orca instead. No legs required.
Even fetuses lie. We diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction because we saw one. What if that’s not the whole story. What if the little bugger is hiding something? Real reason for the mirror syndrome. Have we looked under its bed? Have we checked its diary?
She’s not going to last weeks.
Maternal Mirror Syndrome has one surefire cure. Deliver the fetus.
Fetus.
Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her? [All three refuse to meet his eyes. He pushes off his desktop and grabs his coat.]
The swollen bladder was not the only problem. We can’t leave it inside you. We have to terminate.
We can. And it won’t matter. The fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable.
You’re on dialysis for your kidneys. Your kidneys can wait. They don’t make dialysis for your liver. You’re not going to make it two more days.
It’s killing you.
It’s not a baby. It’s a…tumor. [She holds up her hand in a “stop” gesture.] I understand dying for a cause, sacrificing your life so your child might live. But that’s not the choice here. Either it dies or you both die.
I can’t fix it. I’m scheduling a D and C. [He gets up to leave.]
Her kidneys are almost irreparable. She’s developed severe DIC. You have to force her to terminate.
No! I dropped an anvil on its chest to prevent lung development. I’m trying to extinguish the human race one fetus at a time.
My real patient is dying. Very quickly. Like I wouldn’t advise her to buy any green bananas. The fetus is nothing more than a parasite at this point. Removing it is an instant cure.
See, you get it. She’ll listen to you.
You let this woman refuse to terminate, you’re helping her commit suicide. As her doctor, my recommendation is against suicide.
Then she’d be an idiot.
It isn’t.
Wow. If the ass kisser won’t agree with you, you must be even wronger than I thought.
So her theory is that our patient’s liver problems were just a giant coincidence.
Brown-noser.
Oh look. Sticking up for your girlfriend. Who says chivalry’s dead?
Be patient. She’s going through all of us. She’ll get that jungle fever eventually. [Cameron glares at House.]
You love him? [Chase and Cameron each give him a look.]
What worked?
Cab’s on its way. I have to finish packing. [He starts to close the door. She pushes it open.]
Helps to know they’re idiots.
You’re not objective. But you’re not an idiot. [He takes the film and holds it to the light.] His lungs are still two weeks away from being viable.
These tissue buds are new. Could indicate bronchopulmonary sequestration or diaphragmatic eventration.
Could be lung lesions. CCAM.
Move. [He motions for Cuddy to back up so he can lock the door.]
Somebody had to save our boss’ rotundous ass. Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.
Thanks. Got that multiple choice all worked out. The question is, how do we pick between A, B, C, D and “none of the above.”
What would we do if this patient were not just a tadpole. Say it was an actual person.
Thanks for playing along. Pretend that it’s a one-pound adult. Forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta. How would we get a better look at what’s in the lungs?
[Makes whining “eheheheh” sound.] You can’t just shoot everything down, Chase. You’re not me. Collaborate.
How do we get a fetus to breathe in a radioactive isotope? Idiot.
Let’s do that. [He starts to leave, stopping next to Cuddy.] You’re the one who insists we treat it like a person. I’ll put it back when I’m done. [He leaves.]
Me again. Your friendly neighborhood belly-squirter. [He hangs his cane from the IV pole and opens Emma’s gown over her belly and sits in bedside chair.] We’re going to do open fetal surgery. Open the uterus cut out the fetus so we can look around. I know you can’t talk so I need you to look petrified if you consent.
[out of corner of his mouth but at regular volume] Don’t lower expectations if you want them to do something.
You all here for the fetal surgery? Because we are way over capacity.
Mind each other’s personal space. There are sharp implements in the room. Like this one. [He holds up scalpel and starts to incise Emma’s belly.] Uterus is fully exposed.
Have you never sucked beer out of the bottom of a keg? Where’d you go to college? Gimme that.
Sorry. I just realized I forgot to TiVo “Alien.” [He attaches paper, presumably the pulse ox, to the baby’s hand.]
Position him for the incision.
It’s the mom. She’s in V-fib.
Looks like asystole. Paddling’s not going to do anything.
We’re going to lose them both. Clamp! The surgery’s not doing this to her, the fetus is. [He starts to clamp the umbilical cord.]
The only way to save her is to cut away the anchor holding her down. [He starts to cut the cord.]
Just like that.
What’s amazing is how blond your baby’s hair is.
You know, the thing in your belly that tried to kill you.
[stares at her] Any pain?
You can only get out of bed to pee, poo or shower. And absolutely no sex. So stop flirting with me. [He takes a Vicodin.]
Um. If you call being born twice, normal. [He gets up to leave.]
Don’t thank me. I would have killed the kid.
I’m off the clock.
[pulls something out] First class ticket to Vancouver Island.
Yeah. Who doesn’t like Canadians?
You didn’t need to apologize.
You screwed up.
You let your maternal instinct get the best of you and nearly killed two people. In a case like this you terminate and mom lives 10 times out of ten. You do what you did, mom and baby both die 9.9 times out of 10.
No. It’s smaller. Exactly 9.8 smaller. Always is, always will be.
Antique vintner's cane. Cost me nine hundred dollars.
Ah! That explains the vintner's reference.
[looks back the noisy kid] Only if he's stuck in a bottle of Zinfandel.
[has had enough, turns to the mother] Give her twenty milligrams of antihistamine. Could save her life. 'Cause he she doesn't shut up, I'll kill her.
You only forced me to deliver a speech, not goodwill.
Huh, may have been short, but it had girth!
I was hungry.
I was thirsty.
I was lonely.
[standing] Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[sitting comfortably in his seat] No mistake. Just arranged for a five hundred dollar fare reduction. Expense problem solved.
Thank you.
[pulling out a menu] Uh, no. Think I will switch to the... Syrah!
He's drunk.
Yes!
I'll go get her.
Did you really think I was gonna leave you stuck back here for eighteen hours?
Go on, enjoy. With the Vicodin and the wine, I can sleep anywhere.
Wasn't supposed to be funny-ha-ha.
Wow! We just attended a symposium on pandemics and you've run right into one on the flight home. Talk about a small world.
[reassuring with a "mind-your-own-business" tone] No!
Someone has a hangover. [to Cuddy] He had a snoot-load of Bloody Marys before dinner.
It is also textbook allergic reaction to... pollen... peanuts, semen-stained polyester blanket he's lying on.
[cutting her off, stern] We don't! You misunderstood. Dr. Cuddy just meant that... he might feel less nauseous if he was facing a different direction. She didn't mean to panic a planeload of people.
He'll be fine. [to Keo] I'm a doctor too.
Korean male, mid-thirties, 5' 9", one-sixty, bald, scar on the right side of his jaw, medic alert bracelet on his left wrist indicating that he is allergic to, at least, penicillin.
Good point. [to Keo] On the other hand, I am a Board-certified specialist in infectious disease. She assigns parking spaces.
No. He's all better.
[pointing towards the aisle] Look that way.
'Cause you're gonna throw up and I don't want it on me.
Give her a banana. Monkey see, monkey barf. You smell vomit...
Okay, wasn't expecting that.
I need help!
Need someone to talk to.
[to the kid] Can you say, [bad Australian accent] "Croikey, myte"?
Perfect. Now, no matter what I say, you'll agree with me, okay?
Nicely done.
You... disagree with everything I say.
[shrugging] That's close enough.
And you... get morally outraged with everything I say.
Wow, you guys are good. [back to work, writing] We are looking for the simplest way to explain these symptoms.
[guessing] Organophosphate poisoning. Some international flights spray pesticides.
No worries. _We_ think it's pesticide poisoning.
Dramamine overdose.
Jet lag.
Deep vein thrombosis.
Food poisoning. What was on the menu?
[ignoring her] Sea bass, seafood kebabs?
He had the sea bass. Please tell me she had the kebabs.
Ciguatera poisoning. It's an instant onset toxin. [looking at the Air Whiteboard] Symptoms include "E", all of the above. 'S only found in certain kinds of tropical gamefish, such as...? [motions to Air Chase to finish]
[to Cuddy] Make sure you get a rèsumé from him.
[over PA system, deep, polite-sounding voice] Helloo?
[over PA system] Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief announcement concerning your meals. IF you ate the sea bass or the seafood kebabs, you have ingested a dangerous toxin.
[over PA system] However, if you proceed to the restrooms both on your left or right or rear of the plane and vomit as soon as possible, the toxic effect should be minimal.
[can't resist, over PA system] Thank you and have a pleasant flight.
[nods] I know.
Good news is, all the pilots are red-meat men. Although I was kind of looking forward to landing this puppy myself.
[removing his headphones] Ow. That makes sense. First class ate before coach. He digested more of his food before he threw up.
[looks behind at Peng, then back to Cuddy] We're not gonna see ataxia.
No, it's just hard to show clumsiness when you're lying moaning in the fetal position.
[to Peng, loudly] Hey! S... [removes the noseplugs] Stand up!
Nobody speak Korean on this flight?
I know how to ask him if his sister's over eighteen. I don't think that's gonna help. [even louder, to Peng] Hey! Stand up! [mimicking standing up] Stand... up!
Don't play the cripple card with me.
It's definitely ataxia. It's definitely a rash.
Thin leg. It's been in a cast.
So it could be radiation poisoning.
From the X-rays they took of it.
Unless those X-rays were performed in "Wankoff", North Korea by a third-grade dropout with a 50-year-old imager. [pointing to Peng's bald head] Which accounts for the absence of fur. Radiation poisoning accounts for all the symptoms.
[has enough of her] You're pregnant.
Explains the nausea, abdominal pains, fever. And why you're stuffing your 36Cs into a 34B bra.
PUPPPs. Common pregnancy rash.
You a virgin?
You're pregnant. Mazel tov. [to Cuddy] Let's get him into the chair.
I believe in statistics. Two hundred passengers on the plane.
Ten should be gay, two should be with child, and one should be incredibly annoying with an extra ass chromosome.
[to Keo] Get him some iodized salt to protect his thyroid. I'm going back...
[looks up] I'm trying to listen to you now, so shut up. [listens into her chest again] Heart's fine. [can't resist mentioning] Breasts are firm.
Tell them there's nothing to worry about.
Yeah.
Tell them there's nothing to worry about. Gimme a flash light.
I'll call down to the pharmacy.
Then get me a lab. [now smelling her stomach] Pseudomonas smell yeasty. Staph smells musty. Some liver diseases smell of ammonia.
[results of the smell-test] Citrusy on the nose, with a blush of toasted coconut.
Need to get a better look at your rash.
Fine, shall I go with "Lifeguard Cuddy" or "Mother Superior Cuddy"?
Nothing...
Nothing... [addressing everybody] C'mon, nobody has no meds.
Open your mouth.
[standing upright] Where is the acyclovir?
Well, you'd better get some. You've got herpes.
What do you know? He's got some. This must be your lucky day.
[loudly] This is for real! People are sick! Some of us will be deplaning in body bags unless you cough up.
[as the pillowcase starts to fill up] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. God bless you.
Lotta apples, not many candy bars.
Three caps of augmentin.
He's allergic to penicillin.
If he has a severe reaction, ten epi pens won't save him. [holds out the pills] You take the pills.
He's a guy who doesn't speak English.
[arguing] If it's not meningitis, we're risking his life and flushing meds down the toilet.
[nods] Sounds like a plan. Oh, except for the part where we don't have an LP needle. Oh, and the shaking of the plane means I'll probably pierce his spinal cord and cripple him for life, but, [shrugs] I mean, it totally sounds like a plan.
Shut up. Don't get hysterical.
[to Air Cameron] Hold this.
[over PA system, somberly] Ladies and gentlemen, we have a passenger with a confirmed case of bacterial meningitis.
[over PA system] And even if we land as soon as possible, the passenger will not survive. It's very likely that some of you have been infected as well.
[over PA system] As soon as you start feeling symptoms, we need to isolate you in the first class cabin.
[over PA system, rattling off the symptoms] Fever, rash,...
[over PA system, continuing]... nausea, and in the late stages...
[over PA system]... tremor in the left hand.
Break out the bubbly. [yells] Yo! Listen up!
[over PA system] Bad news is you have an illness. The good news is, it's not meningitis.
[over PA system] It's not fatal. It's just embarrassing. It's conversion disorder. More commonly known as mass hysteria.
It happens often in high anxiety situations, especially to women.
I know it sounds sexist, but science says you're weak and soft, [chuckling] what can I do?
Yeah, look at her hand. Shaking left hand. What is that a symptom of? Not meningitis. It's basically a symptom of nothing. Put the idea into their heads and watched it happen. Same thing that Peng cruelly did with the puking and the rash.
Your mind controls your body. It thinks you're sick, it makes you sick.
[over PA system] If-if you'll all just calm down, your symptoms will soon go away. And to facilitate this process, your flight crew will move through the cabin with a complimentary bar service.
[over PA system] Thank you and, as always, have a pleasant flight.
Still feel like puking?
LP was negative. I came up with an alternate theory and I tested it. Couldn't have done it without you. Rage is a symptom of mass hysteria. Just one more thing to clean up. Peng set off the mass hysteria. What set off Peng?
Yeah. And I haven't the faintest idea why.
It's when you're molested by a priest's cousin.
Worried they'll make you look bad? Could be symptomatic of head trauma, cerebral infarction or intercranial hemorrhage. Thoughts?
Too long to wait. His head's as smooth as a baby's bottom. No bumps, so I think we can rule out head trauma. So you gotta choose between what's left. Clog or leak?
Not so far.
First of all, he apparently speaks a language that no one else speaks. Which makes talking up the ladies a little rough.
Condoms. He has focal limb paralysis.
No, by cocaine. Was inside the condom, is now spreading through his digestive tract.
I think he's a jackass. We're gonna have to operate.
You're gonna need to hold him down. He's not gonna like this.
Fits the symptoms.
[gloving up] Pretty much.
Oh, aren't you clever?
[motioning to Air Chase] C'mon.
[to Peng] Well, I know you're "pretty much" [looks at Air Cameron] unconscious, but as it's been pointed out to me, "pretty much" doesn't mean squat.
Okay, hold him tight.
The faster we do this, the less likely he is to die of shock.
Tighter.
Do that again. Ease off, then press down.
[to Cuddy] Pressure on his joints relieves his pain.
Wrong again. [looking around] Where's his wallet?
Scuba certification card.
Yeah. You also have a receipt from Tekong's Scuba Rental dated yesterday?
Went diving yesterday. Like an idiot, he surfaced too quickly. Like a bigger idiot, he boarded a flight which is pressurized to 8,000 feet above sea level. Low pressure is killing him. Tell the pilot to dive until we can club baby seals out of the window.
And get him some oxygen.
I saved your life. You owe me.
But you didn't know that. You owe me.
Your mind convinced your body to get a rash, photophobia and vomit. How d'you know it wouldn't have shut down your cold, cold heart next?
[complaining] You're mean.
You're extremely welcome.
[intrigued] Are you handicap-accessible?
[Quietly to himself] Oh for God's sakes. [Cuddy walks through the door] Stop! Don't move. The way the soft evening light catches your eyes. [Cuddy smiles] The gentle caress of the dusk on her hair as you turn around and leave my office without giving me that file.
Boring.
Less boring, or grandma's been held back a few years.
Then get her into surgery.
Tricky procedure. It's going to take all night. [House takes the file and throws it on his desk.] Sleep tight. [Starts to leave.]
Fascinating, but since the pathology on the pericardium won't be back until after they remove it. [Cuddy gets in front of House and stops him moving by putting the file on his chest. House sighs and takes the file.]
[To the ducklings.] Round up the usual suspects. Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis... Heck, go wild, do all the osises. [Ducklings don't look too pleased to be staying late.] [To Cuddy.] All taken care of, sleep tight. [Leaves.]
You guys are idiots.
No. Because you stayed up all night doing exactly what I told you to do and have nothing to show for it.
I asked you what 2 + 2 equals and a day later you tell me not 25.
Nice work.
Work smart, not hard. [Chase smiles at Cameron.] Find out which fungus, biopsy a lymph node. Take employee of the month with you.
I know. [Walks into his office.]
So, what does the double vision tell us?
So we're back to square one.
Yes, 2+2 doesn't equal 12 or 16 either.
Did you look at her knees?
Those knobby things in the middle of her legs, any scars or scabs?
Well most 6 year olds hurt themselves, a lot. Crash their bikes, climb trees, bungee jump.
Because running around outside hurts.
Most 6 year olds are not familiar with the phrase 'my joints feel inflamed'. So, 2+2 equals?
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. We're checking her ANA to confirm and giving her steroids to fix her vision. Some idiot gave me two tickets for a play tonight. Saved his life, apparently worth 186 dollars. [House walks into exam room one, revealing a guy sitting on the table] [To the patient] Sorry, had to take a leak.
It's an exam room. What did you think I was doing?
Well it'd be stupid to do it in here. There's a patient in here. [Wilson rolls his eyes.] [To Eddie, the patient.] You been drinking more?
[To Wilson who is still standing in the doorway] Guy's peeing all the time. Play. Interested?
I'm not going.
You thought this was a date? [Turns back to the patient.] Any other symptoms?
[Shows Wilson the tickets.] You want the tickets or not?
It's a play. Dudes only go to plays if they're dragged by women they're hoping to see naked.
Maybe there's someone you want to see naked.
[Turns back to the patient.] Any fever?
Anything in your pee other than pee?
I'm going to need a urine sample.
Yeah that last one wasn't a question. You might have diabetes...
We have bathrooms.
Where can you pee?
Or she has another stroke. Arthritis, heart disease, why can't this kid act her age?
Well thick blood explains the stroke, could also have caused an autoimmune response, which would explain the JRA kicking into gear. But what explains the thick blood?
What explains the lack of oxygen?
Hey! Don't make me turn the hose on you two. Chase is right. You two go check the house, see if Dad's a closet Marlboro man.
By making you do your job? Does seem kind of cruel doesn't it? Take along a carbon monoxide detector to check for leaks and you [points to Foreman] start her on hydroxyurea to control her red blood cell production. Take out a Merck Manual, medieval edition, tell you how to drain a pint or two so she doesn't clot again.
Well this sucks. Either it's abuse or it's not abuse. Which means either it's a symptom or it's completely irrelevant. Either way we have to waste half a day figuring out which. Full physical exam. Look for bruises we may have missed, check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.
Never is just reven spelt backwards. [Hands the t-shirt to Foreman and leaves.]
Yes.
I'm going to ask you for some blood.
To see if your answer will be 'I can't bleed in public'. This wasn't your urine was it?
Usual reason is because you're on steroids.
Duh. The second favourite reason is because you're on drugs.
I am. Third favourite reason is — you have insurance but your friend, Eggs Benedict, doesn't. So Eggs describes a list of symptoms and you repeat them to a doctor. Which is particularly stupid because this is a free clinic.
My work here is done. [Starts to leave.]
No, you're pregnant.
She might have been abused. That's horrifying. Why are you wearing extra concealer under your eyes?
Dad consented to the exam, which means it's not the Dad. How late were you out last night?
[Loudly.] Panty hamster get a spin on its wheel?
What play?
You're trying to have sex with Cuddy.
You took her to a play. You only take women to plays because...
Ok, then why did you take her to a play?
A friend with a squish mitten.
Blasphemer! She's not a friend of the opposite sex, she's a different species. [Takes a fry.] She's an administrator. She's going to eat your head after she's done.
[Shocked.] Seriously?
[Not convinced.] Yes you did.
[Shocked.] Seriously?
It's not her blood.
Apparently forgot to sneak the shaving cream.
Excellent argument. [To Foreman] It's a tumour.
If the tumour's not in her brain it's in her reproductive tract. Get an MRI. [Gets up.]
Waste your time? Wouldn't recognise you if you didn't.
They printed my letter. [Pays for the magazine and starts to walk off. Wilson runs up behind him.]
Of course I was. What are we talking about? [Holds up the magazine.] They printed my letter.
You want to see her naked. [They walk over to the doors to the Clinic.]
Just thanking you for the play. You see some people fell an emotion called gratitude.
I suspected. Explains how you knew who they were from.
No… I think they're the hugs. I think Os are the kisses.
I'll miss you. You were a good friend. [House walks into the clinic towards Cuddy. Holds up the magazine.] They printed my letter. How was the play Mrs. Lincoln?
He's just a little freaked.
I sent him flowers. [Smiles. Cuddy looks confused.]
[Answers.] Somebody better be dying.
And I care because?
Bees or monkeys yes, sociopaths no.
He's not a sociopath.
He's acting logically. He's got a crush on you. He's being aggressive about it. Not just regular aggressive. He's out of his mind on hormones aggressive.
Better figure out what's killing the girl cause her brother's got it too.
[To Foreman] You went home? [Foreman nods. House is pleased.] Good for you. Delegate.
Making it all the more impressive.
That's ridiculous. You're way too skinny to be menstruating.
Pull all of her medical records, find any similarities to our patients, and punch the little brat on the nose so he doesn't have a stroke like his sister. [Walks off towards his office.]
If she gets one in her brain or heart, she's dead. [Turns to Cameron and Chase.] No pressure though.
Yes, that would make complete sense if they had one.
Two siblings, same condition. Its got to be genetic or environmental. If you add in ‘same time’ and we're back to just environmental.
[Mimicking Cameron.] Just because we haven't found anything yet.
No! [Cameron stops.] We have no evidence.
[Interrupting.] Most likely means she wants to root around inside your little girl's brain without any guarantee that it will work, that's why she's holding off on doing your son.
Who else visits these kids?
You got a girlfriend?
School?
Nanny?
Yet. It took your son twice as long to develop symptoms as your daughter, maybe the other kids are just slow.
She does this and your daughter will need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of her life.
And isn't that every parents dream, to have a kid grow up to be relatively normal.
[Whispers in Cameron's ear.] You did NOT just play the dead husband card. [To Deran.] My wife died because she signed a consent form that I didn't want her to sign. Died.
How did you know?
That the other kids weren't sick. You've been here for 4 days.
Right...
[Smiles.] Do you have hair on your special place?
I'm a doctor. Two of your kids are sick and I need to know why.
I think you're dating their Dad.
No, but I don't really care why he didn't. I just need to know how often you go to their house and what you bring.
Shampoos, fancy soaps, kids get in your bag?
Lip wax?
[Grabs her hand.] Mani-pedi?
Women get a wax as part of a whole self-indulgent beauty ritual — pedicure, steam, cucumber masks. No one runs out at lunch just to get a lip wax, unless you woke up looking like Yosemite Sam.
It's always the Dad.
Excess facial hair in women, it's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance, exactly what the little kiddies have.
There's something wrong in your pants.
Never occurred to you to get a prescription instead of some penis pumper loaded with testosterone?
But you have.
30% of our waste is excreted through our skin. That sounds high. That's why you stink after eating garlic. Jack waters his beanstalk everyday for a week and he's oozing bean curd out of his pores for a month. Every time you gave the little tykes a hug you gave them a dose of testosterone, small for you but more then their little bodies could handle.
Uh-huh.
You'll be floppy, they'll be fine. [Looks at Jasper teasing Lucy by not letting her get her bunny.] He'll still be eight. [Pops a pill.]
[Takes off his glasses.] You ok?
[Puts the magazine down.] Talk to Cuddy?
Just... be straight with her.
[Trying not to smile.] In what way?
[Still trying fairly successfully to keep a straight face.] You sure she feels...
Cameron would tell you to say how you feel. Me, I'd get her drunk.
[Struggling to keep a straight face he has to cover his mouth with his hand.] That's... a bold move, Cuddy likes bold. Yeah, your right, if you spoke you'd say something stupid.
[Laughs.] Well you made a compelling argument.
Yes, because, you took her to a play [Wilson throws his arms up in the air.] because actually you do want to march down there and kiss her.
Yes you do.
[Shocked.] Seriously?
Night Wilson.
Give him a break, it's May - October at worst.
May is when things start to get hot.
Guy gets a little something-something, couple of kids have to die, circle of life.
[Long pause.] I got tickets to a play...
Loss of free will.  I like it.  Maybe we can get Thomas Aquinas in for a consult.  What caused the T.I.A.?
Second ex-Mrs. Wilson wanting money?
Market’s doing badly, she wants money.
She wants –
Pool boy?
No longer interested.
I asked Cuddy to a play Thursday.  [Wilson laughs.]
She said she was busy.
I asked her as a test.
A lot about bondage.  She’s busy for me, but not for you.  She’s not interested in the play qua play, she’s interested in you.
You cannot see her socially.  You’re leading her on!
So all this enjoying is an act of charity?
What’s life without the ability to make stupid choices?  She needs her free will.  Find out why her brain froze before she can’t decide to make her next breath.  Find the toxin, run your bubble study.  You won’t find anything, but I’ll get the office to myself.  There’s a lot of porn piling up on the internet.  It doesn’t download itself!
You like Hockney?
Hot stuff, were the Venezuelan pictures.
Yes, but you have no idea how it’s a trick.
You’re going to a gallery to see Venezuelan pictures that don’t exist, but you won’t go to a play with me.  Why?
Is that why you said no?
I’m not safe?  Cool.  James Wilson is never a safe choice.
Sure, you say that now.  He always marries them in the end!
They’re not supposed to get past the bouncers.
The only question is what kind of autoimmune.
It always matters what kind.
Treatment is always boring!  Diagnosis is –
Yeah, got it.  Start her on steroids.
Told you.  That was boring.  I gotta go out.
Wilson’s got a date.
Hey, I need a condo.  Didn’t you and Wilson have your first date around here?
Really?  He’s my best friend.
Oh.  Not quite as close to here as I remembered.
Absolutely not.
Since I wasn’t paying attention back then, what was it like dating him?
Love it.  So he’d say it’s not a date, but then he’d jump you.
Did you just compare Wilson to a tampon?
I cook a lot.  Go on.
Hey hey, we’re here to talk real estate, not Wilson.  So you’re saying if you actually had sex before you connected emotionally, you’d have gotten over it.
Right.
I don’t usually put out on the first date, but I gotta say, that is a rad move.  Get her consent.  Start the radiation.
I’ll get her consent.
Patient doesn’t like Foreman.  I’m interested.
Fatigue, hair loss, possibility of damage to the lungs, infertility.  All possible side effects of radiation.  Why don’t you like Dr. Foreman?
How good is he?
There’s a small possibility of leukemia some time in the future.  Hardly worth mentioning.  You can’t say he’s better than he is if you don’t know how good he is.
I am.  You might also get cataracts.  Sign here.
We’re saving your life.  We’re that good.  Sign there.
Would you rather a pencil or a pen?  Who’s the better James Bond, Sean Connery or Daniel Craig?  Now, you see, that’s not even a decision.
Good lord, how do you still have teeth?
You’re an addict.  I’m saving you from yourself.
If I can figure out where you keep going wrong, then I can nip this Cuddy thing in the bud before she becomes the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.
You have to have sex with Cuddy.
[loudly] Huh?!  [normally]  Yeah.  She also said if she slept with you before she liked you, then it would have been easier to handle when you turned into the sorry bastard that left her alone.
You think that’s going to stop her?  The woman’s the worst realtor in New Jersey.
It sounds like she’s septic.
How much?
Do an echo to confirm it’s in her heart, and then I’ll tell our patient that we just killed her.
I’m busy.
I’m off the market for condos.
Of course he was right.  He doesn’t stop giving good advice just because you’re divorced.  He’s compulsive about remaining on good terms with his exes.
No.  Let’s keep it a mystery.
Wow.  Did I ever waste money on that place setting.
Whereas I never hurt you!  I never even married you, cleverly hoping to avoid moments like this one.
You keep yelling, and I’ll think you owe me sex.
First, “Hector does go rug” is a lame anagram.  You want a better one for “Gregory House”: “Huge ego, sorry”.  Second, find a new career.  You’re never going to sell to anybody if you let them control the agenda.  And third, I don’t owe you anything.  I’m not Wilson, I’m not going to buy a condo just to make you feel better.
Prepping for an aspiration.  We still don’t know what infection –
It’s not going to hurt her.  Well, it is going to hurt her, but –
This will just take a few minutes.  Grab a piece of an abscess, some pus –
You really don’t care why she’s going to be dead.
WHAT?  What did we screw up, what did we miss?  I need to know.
Yeah?
Her bra hook.
She scratched herself with her bra hook.  That’s how the infection got in.  Staph aureus.
That and some bad decisions.
Go home, have a few drinks, go to sleep, get up tomorrow, and do it tomorrow, only better.  If you need absolution, go to a priest or give alms to the poor, whatever ritual comforts you.
Yeah, me too.
No.  And you’ll do it again.  To a lot of doctors, this would be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of mistake.  But we’re not a lot of doctors.  We’ll save a lot more patients than the guy down the street, but a few of the ones he’d save by doing what everyone else does we will lose.
Because they don’t lie.  I can’t forgive you, Foreman, because there’s nothing to forgive.  [He leaves.]
That guilt is irrelevant.
Can’t.  I’ve got a dog waiting at home.
[annoyed] C'mon.
[reading] Not with an enlarged spleen and a fever.
[finishes writing] Tell me about it. I can't even find the one I've got working for me. Where is Foreman?
Ha! Nothing like a dead patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.
Hey! You're not gonna believe what happened. Wilson just killed a kid the same way you did.
Five days are gonna fly by. He didn't look both ways before he nuked. [drums his cane on the ground] You done talking to your imaginary friend? Because I thought maybe you could do your job.
Great idea, if you're looking to save exactly one kid. Broad-spec will take at least a week to work. We need narrow-spec. [looks at his cane, then to Wilson] How old is Hector?
Seventeen? That's like...a hundred and nineteen in human years. Why's he still alive?
That's 'cause the infection is too small. We start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay. We need to grow more needles.
Okay, that... probably needs further explanation. We make the donor kid sicker. We freeze him, we soak him, break down his immune system. Suddenly we're looking at some needle a camel can pass through the eye of.
True, but who cares? Once we know what the infection is, we'll know exactly how to treat it. As long as he isn't dead yet, we're cool.
Waste of time. You think it's in the house. I know it's in the patient.
[beat] Fine. Go.
[butting in] Ever get caught in the rain without an umbrella? That's all we're talking about here. Sign the form.
We're not GM! No recalls, no rebates. Any more questions while your son's life slips away?
Yes! [to Wilson] Sorry, your patient. You tell them.
All you had to do was say, "Yes, I do." God knows that's a phrase you've used often enough in your life.
That's not enough for you. You need them to feel good about saying yes.
[the argument-winner] I'm taller.
The only value of that trust is you can manipulate them.
Giving parents the chance to make a bad choice was a bad choice.
One they'd regret at their son's funeral.
Adorable! Please, I thought you were dignified.
Come on, how am I not supposed to make that joke? The best thing about big honkin' gonads -
Mind if I ask why?
In case we're wrong?
Fine. Go.
This is perfect.
Okay. Perfect is too strong a word. But it's very, very good. Now we know where the infection is. All we gotta do is remove the valve, ID the infection, target and destroy.
He'll be heart-broken on account of his dead brother.
We don't have to. We have to clear his marrow. After the surgery, harvest the marrow, marinate it in the targeted antibiotic, simmer and serve.
[nods] Fine. Go. In fact, let's all go.
[not looking at up from his magazine] Wilson's right, Foreman's wrong, and your shirt is way too revealing for the office.
I didn't.
Tried to cut him some slack.
I think he's got the yips.
Steve Blass, Scott Norwood, David Duval. All got the yips. Great athletes. Lost their confidence, and immediately started sucking.
Mm-hmm! Four days, then he's fired. You don't get better from the yips.
If you want both kids to live, it's the only choice.
[cynically] Maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.
He won't be able to play baseball. But that doesn't make him a cripple.
That was awesome!
I gotta start pretending to care.
No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear.
You've gotta be kidding me. You're actually upset. You just said what you believed.
Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong. You're not protecting your choices.
You're soothing your conscience.
[calling out after him] Am I blushing?
[into phone] Yeah?
[into phone] You woke me up to tell me that you're lazy.
[into phone] I'm tired. Get to the point.
[seeing something] Oh, God.
[into phone, mock-concern] I think Hector's committed suicide.
[into phone] He took some pills.
[into phone] He ate half my stash. Of course he's...
[into phone] He's stoned. I'll be right in.
Cut all the way into this kid's heart, and all we got was this lousy, non-infectious fibrous tissue.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not our fault. Fibrous tissue! Something is turning his healthy heart valve to gristle.
Lupus and Behçets are our best bet. Do an ANA and a pathergy test.
My memory's not what it used to be, but didn't we just rule that out eight seconds ago?
Uh-huh, and it has the obvious advantage of making us right all along. A little disadvantage of making big brother dead.
[pointedly] It fits.
That's your argument? It sucks for them?
Six out of six is two better than four out of six, right? I mean, I know two is so small, but since it means that he's gonna get Graft vs. Host disease, the marrow will attack his body and he'll die a painful death. [to the others] Find out what autoimmune it is.
Wanna catch a movie?
I know a place. Although I wouldn't recommend wearing those shoes.
Is that a riddle?
I must have left it off.
I think he hopped upon to the bathroom counter.
No! It's your damn dog! [holding up the top of the cane] He chews everything! I was missing a file. Found paper in his stool. An original Sun record '78 Elvis recording - gone! Who the hell chews vinyl? He's vindictive. [beat] And he's had a good, long life. It's his time.
I just tripped over Wilson's self-righteousness.
[cold-shoulders the helping hand] What d'you got?
Hmm. Did I mention my concerns about four being less than six? Wilson's first wife ignored a similar issue. Of course, that time, it was only fatal to their marriage.
[getting up] Do it alphabetically. We're not doing that damn transplant. [looks around] Where's Foreman?
Did he also explain what sort of pain your son will experience if he gets Graft vs. Host
Apparently, he didn't explain it vividly enough. Let me give it a whack.
No! You screwed us.
What is the point in being able to control people if you won't actually do it? 'S like training a dog and then letting him go on your rug. Which, by the way...
[arguing loudly] You don't explain chances and probabilities. You lie to them. You tell them Foreman's a moron - which isn't even much of a lie right now.
I got no problem with what Foreman did.
[mad] Well, he did what he thought was right! You, on the other hand, sucked out! When the decision really mattered, you didn't have the guts to tell them what to do! 'F that kid dies, it's because Foreman was wrong AND because you're a coward!
[top of his voice] Oh, goodness! I've left my door open! My poor dog must've run away and been hit by a car or... truck. [hopeful] Or train.
[even more hopeful] Or an anvil.
[oh, joy...] Thank God. You're still here. [top of voice again] He's still here!
Where's my stereo?
[deep voice] Hello?
Paying for my new cane. It was your dog.
Apparently. Showed up.
Hey.
[beat] I'm sorry.
You're pathetic. I didn't actually mean that.
No, I didn't. To infinity.
[into phone] Yeah. [listens] When? [listens] What did the lab say? [listens] Uh-huh?
[to Wilson] Fewer bitchin' choices. [into phone] Okay.
What do you got in bitchin'?
[taking off the hat] That was Cameron. The kid that wasn't all that sick is now all that sick. He's bleeding out of his ears.
Down.
His body's not making new blood cells. His bone marrow's crashing.
It's a little too Marilyn Manson in a retirement home. [returns it; to Wilson] Meds are suppressing his bone marrow.
[impressed] Very cool.
Penis canes are murder. [hands it back, points] Let me see the one on the end.
[to Wilson] You need to stop Matty's meds. The marrow rebounds, it's the meds. If it doesn't, it's an infection.
Maybe I was wrong about which kid's gonna die.
Bitchiiiin'.
[swinging it up] Makes it look like I'm going fast. Now, how's our dying kids?
[to him] Feeling guilty?
Always a comfort. Okay, what's the other kid's status?
God is done with Nick. We know what he has. We know how to treat it. We're doing it. It's not working. Life is for the living.
Cultures still aren't growing anything.
Because you did the right thing. Convinced the parents to treat the kid. All you did was yank the weed out of the ground. It's roots are still killing your beautiful lawn. We just can't see it. And if we can't see it, we don't know what it is. And if we don't know what it is, we can't kill it. You gotta wait for it to grow back again. [sighs] Now his soil is arid. So he and his brother will be dead by the time...
What if the dandelion was in fertile soil? [turns to the others] What if we take the roots from Matty and put them in Nick? Turn the kid into a petri dish? Only better. A petri dish can't tell you when it hurts.
Leukemia kid's got no defenses.
But before he does, the infection will spread, fast. Fast enough to tell us what it is. In time to save his brother.
Yes.
Nick is gonna die either way.
Graft vs. Host is not gonna go away because of Nick's sunny smile and positive outlook.
He's being torn apart from the inside out. His pain's gonna get worse and worse until he dies. You're just dragging it out. [beat] You have only one decision to make - to leave here with one dead son or two.
Tell 'em.
Patients' parents apparently don't want to be parents anymore. [to Chase] You're a sneaky bastard. Any ideas how we get around this?
[disappointed] That's hardly sneaky.
Ten thousand possible infections. At least twenty minutes per test. Take you approximately eight years.
He's timid. Testing blindly is not gonna save this kid.
Wow, he sure is hurting.
[pulling out his scrip book] If I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
Pharmacy's on the ground floor.
It's not gonna help. You're dying. Nothing's gonna change that. Drugs'll just make you go easier.
Fourteen years on the planet. Most of them spent suffering. Dying before you even got to drive a car, take off a girl's bra, drink a beer. Believe me, there's plenty you haven't done. Really good stuff. [beat] Must make it hard to believe in God or... fairness, a larger purpose. [beat] But your life doesn't have to be meaningless. You can save your brother.
How much heat are you taking from the parents?
Welcome back, Foreman.
Tell him how proud I am?
Pride and shame only apply to people we have a vested interest in, not employees.
Good point. [gets up] But first, I gotta tell Cameron and Chase that they're violating God's will.
... he did a good job? He knows it. Adults don't need adult conversations. Just like I don't need this conversation.
Obviously not.
[sarcastically] Bad dog!
Why would I want to keep him?
[shrugging] Accidents happen.
Candy?
Good boy.
[bites] Good boy.
[sighs] You did good.
Well, maybe I'm biased, but--
Because you knew it was right. You knew you were saving his brother.
[smirks] You're not. You've been like me since you were eight years old.
[Smiling.] Morning. This is funny [Holds up his coffee and starts to read the side.] People don't...
[Comes back out.] Good morning.
[Comes back out.] You guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?
Not that much blood.
No trauma. She kicked the other guy's ass.
If you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear in a…
[Closing the door.] Feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.
He's afraid of turning into me.
That's it? You're not going to tell him that we're a family and families don't abandon each other?
No.
So, where were we?
Not the case, the speculation. The palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts. Did Foreman get a promotion?
Personally I can't believe I've had the same three employees for three years.
Yes. Life goes on. Look at the eager beaver combing his hair.
Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right. Cameron, check out the dorm and redo the ER labs. [Ducklings leave.] [Calling out after them.] I'll get going on Foreman's farewell party. Everybody good with a mermaid under the stars theme? [They all give him a weird look and then continue leaving.]
I think there's an infection.
I think there's an infection. Blood goes where it's needed. Infection likes nice, wet places, her lungs. Start treatment. All that cool stuff for bacterial, fungal and atypical infections. Get a lung biopsy, I want to see the little bugger up close. [Foreman leaves, Chase starts to follow but changes his mind.]
He wants to breed llamas. [Starts to walk towards Wilson's office.]
[Takes the coffee and sits down.] No one writes tamoxifen like you.
Foreman resigned.
It's okay. No biggie.
He said he didn't want to end up like me. I had a brilliant retort. Can't remember what it was at the moment.
Good point. Can I resign? [Wilson yawns.] What's up with that?
You yawned. I just told you something interesting, so you're not bored. It's 11 o'clock in the morning and you're drinking coffee, so you're not tired. I didn't yawn, so it's not a mirror-neuron reaction. Which leaves symptom, vasovagal issue, maybe a heart problem?
I'm ok with Foreman leaving.
Sorry. I yawned because I was trying to communicate boredom.
How much do you think it would cost to make him want to be like me? [Silence.] Thanks for the coffee. [Leaves.]
She is fine.
Past tense.
From the antibiotics for the infection.
Well, then, you screwed up the biopsy.
Well if I'm wrong, then so is her body, because it obviously thinks she's got an infection or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics. What is pandiculation symptomatic of?
Lets say yes.
Lets say no.
Oh crap.
Shut up. I think she may not have an infection. You better deal with her before she crashes.
[Looking at the chart.] There's something called blued in the pleural effusion. [Looks closer.] Oh, it's not blued, it’s blood. Which is great. Well not for her, but for me. Because it means I think it's an infection.
Can't ignore the blood because it's a minority, can you, Foreman?
Great. Go tell her she's got one of those. Or you could tell her we haven't given her enough antibiotics for her INFECTION. Double the dose, and check her lungs.
[Leaving.] On the outside. She needs an arteriogram.
What isn't, these days? [Shuts the door. Points to Steve's girlfriend, Honey.] You sure you want to be here for this?
Of course. The toilet can be a lonely place. Drop your pants, I'll suit up.
Huh?
Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals.
You're welcome. [They smile at each other.] And the natural fibre clothing I assume means some kind of vegetarian denomination?
Well, whatever floats your poop. And you've been together how long? 6 months?
Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break. [Leaves.]
Three 10-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines. [Signs the book.]
What if the clear arteriogram is significant?
I think there's an infection.
Unless her body can't finish off the fight — maybe goes a couple of rounds then gives up.
Maybe its name is Foreman. [Looks at Foreman, no reaction.] C'mon... where's that smile? That laugh that makes the whole world sunny without contributing to global warming? [Chase laughs, they look at him, he stops and looks down, embarrassed.] Maybe she's missing a protein.
You can't have tested for every protein, I can think of at least one you can't test for at all.
Maybe we can get ahead of the game. Manage each symptom as it comes up. Give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.
So we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it. Stick a needle in her eye. [Takes the pills and goes back into the exam room.] [To Steve.] You're cheating on Honey.
Oh, yes you are.
[Confused.] Well I was going to say relax but, oddly enough, you seem pretty relaxed already.
He's not cheating with another woman, he's cheating with another food group.
His floaters float because they're full of fat. Probably had a big cheeseburger for lunch.
I'm accomplished. I'm funny. Can I have whatever I want? [Steve is shocked. Honey smiles.]
You rang?
I bought you an espresso. [Wilson checks his pocket for his wallet and gives House a weird look.] You've been buying me coffee for a couple of weeks I thought I'd pay you back. [Holds out the coffee on his right to Wilson.] With one.
[Laughs.] Why are you suspicious?
[Laughs again.] What, you think I spat in yours?
I stacked them. [Puts the left one on top of the right and lifts it up to demonstrate, then puts the left one down again and holds out the right one to Wilson.]
What do you think of me hiring a nutritionist instead of a neurologist? I mean, they sound almost the same.
Don't cheapen this. We had an in-depth conversation about proteins and fats. I was about to examine her boyfriend's rectum.
Got her number.
But with the wisdom of a much younger woman.
Several times. We laugh...
And that will be depressing. But it will only make me appreciate all the good things that I do have. [House goes into the Diagnostics Office, Wilson leaves.]
I think there's an infection. Just because the cells in her eye aren't dead yet doesn't mean they're working.
Because if it had been positive it would have proved I was right.
[Smiling.] That's the beauty of the test.
Absolutely. [Ducklings start to leave.] As long as you're scanning, you mind having a boo for an abscess or something caused by an infection? [Ducklings leave.]
Grody.
Who cares? Her head blew up. How cool is that?
[Turns the camera on Cameron.] Meaning you don't think it's an infection, and you'd be right, if you weren't wrong. [Puts the camera back on the open head.]
She's got infections that come and go, which means...
Good guess, but no! Means either she's got a leprechaun in her colon which is playing with the doggie door, letting bacteria in and out or... she got complement factor-H deficiency. [Puts the camera on Foreman.]
I'm saving a woman's life. [Puts the camera on himself.] I'm saving a woman's life. [Camera back on the head.] Actually I'm diagnosing her. Technically I'm diagnosing her with something that's going to kill her but, other than that, I'm saving her life. [Turns the camera off.]
You can't explain transudative pleural effusion with giant cell arteritis. You'd need three whiteboards and 100 different coloured markers.
If you're wrong, and you give her steroids, she dies, now. Foreman, want to run down how it feels to go with your gut and kill a person? You get into the whole spiralling out of control and self-doubt, resigning thing. [To Chase.] Do it. Worst that can happen is you quit. Cameron, want to explain to the parents why you'll be holding paddles while he’s doing it? Because if her heart goes ‘boom’ it'll ‘boom’ right away. [Leaves.]
My patient's about to have a heart attack. [Smiles.] It's going to be massive!
[Pulls out some money.] Can you do me a favour?
Is bile an emotion? Cause I can definitely feel something here [Pushes his gut.] Get me some liquorice. [Shoves the money in the top of her pants.] This is going to be the best heart attack of all time. [Cuddy takes the money and starts to leave.] Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait. [Cuddy comes back.] She's going to shock her. [Cameron looks at the monitors then puts the paddles away, the dad shakes Chase's hand, who looks relieved. House looks disappointed.]
Yes... I did, but only because you didn't trust me! Your best friend.
Amphetamines aren't going to kill you. [Shuts the door.]
[Laughs.] Well, a heart attack is not going to kill you. You were in a hospital. [Wilson yawns.] Aha! You yawned!
I put you on uppers and you still yawned. Means it's a symptom, of being a big fat liar. [Wilson rolls his eyes.] Yawning is a side effect of some antidepressants, apparently the ones you're on.
Well that means it's a symptom of a cerebral tumour. You got six weeks to live. Mr. Well-adjusted is as messed up as the rest of us. Wh-why would you keep that a secret? Are you ashamed of recognising how pathetic your life is?
How long has it been personal?
Yawning's recent so… either you just started or you changed prescription.
They're antidepressants, not anti-annoyance-ants. You'd think this would naturally come up in conversation with...
On one of those occasions when you're pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.
Give me. [Holds out his hand.]
Nope. I'm going to prove that I'm not depressed.
I… wouldn't drink that. [Wilson stares at him.] My leg hurt and I… [points towards the bathroom. Wilson puts the cup down.]
I was sleeping.
Nothing! This is how regular people look when you wake them up.
Huh. HUS is usually caused by an infection or a protein deficiency. [Sits down and starts going through his mail. By going through I mean looking at the labels and throwing them in the bin.] What coincidence I know a patient with an infection and a protein deficiency. You think it's possible there is a connection? [Gets to the last letter and starts to open it.] I want to hear you say it, Chase. It will please me.
There were only two choices, since yours was wrong, mine must have been right. Either that or we missed the leprechaun.
But on the bright side, it confirms my diagnosis. [Foreman and Cameron both shake their heads, House smiles.] Don't you see how incredible this call was? A protein deficiency. Can't be tested, can't be seen. I called it based on coughing blood.
That's not my fault. She was going to die anyway. Now, thanks to me, at least she'll know why.
I'm not telling her.
No one's telling her. Not until we're sure I'm right.
Seems like the humane approach. [Leaves and goes into his office.]
Who? The co-ed?
[Thinks.] Dead sophomore girl?
Dad. Her mother's name is Mommy.
You think they're going to give a crap if I know their names? Five years from now when the father's looking at photographs of his daughter graduating from high school they're not going to remember the nice black doctor who called them by their first name. [Foreman starts to leave, shaking his head.] You don't want to quit.
Didn't sound like I said that. I'm saying that suddenly you're trying to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass. Because you know who you are. You figure if you can make me decent and caring, then maybe there's a hope for...
I'm sorry. Addie you're dying.
Yes. Your infections will get worse. The toxins will spill into your blood.
Two days, maybe less. You have a condition called...
It's a very rare protein deficiency that only...
Ok. [Leaves but watches through the door as Addie comforts her mother. Then goes back in. Half laughs.] It's what's killing you. This is what's killing you. You're not interested in what's killing you?
[Smiling.] What's the point in living,without curiosity? Without craving the...
[Smiling still.] It's-it's-it's like the... dark matter in the universe...
No I'm not. You can only diagnose a problem by looking at what's... [Sees a reflection on himself, smiling.] missing... Oh, God. I have to go. [Leaves.]
[Loudly.] 19-year-old didn't want to hear the coolest explanation of why she's going to die. [Shuts the door, loudly]. Begged me to shut up. [Turns the light on.]
Amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch. She thought that I was happy.
No! I was hazy. I don't get hazy on Vicodin, or anything else I throw down. Which means I was throwing down something I didn't know I was throwing down. Which got me to wondering, why didn't you give me those happy pills?
No, you just didn't want me double dosing. [Wilson starts looking guilty. He knows the game’s up.] You dosed me! Those coffees...
A dying girl thought I was happy. A moron thought I was happy. Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?
Hazy.
Hazy!
She wasn't miserable.
She was no different then she’s ever been. [Epiphany.] She was no different than she'd ever been.... Oh, God. I got to go. [Leaves and slams the door behind him, much to the dismay of Wilson who cringes and rubs his face.]
Need a minute with your daughter.
She's going to live. Does that help? Now get out.
Get out! [Parents leave, House shuts the door.] You... have got leprechauns in ya. [Said in an Irish accent.] Depression manifests in lots of different ways. Some people can't get out of bed all day. Others have serial relationships and become oncologists.
Wrong and wrong. You tried to kill yourself by throwing down kitchen cleanser. Now most normal suicidal morons would have just drank the stuff, burned the hell out of their mouth and throat. Painful, but not deadly. But being a college-educated, suicidal moron, you wrapped it in gel caps or gum. [We follow the gel cap along its path down the throat and into the intestines where it dissolves and starts burning a hole.] Which left no trace but burned a hole in your intestine. But the body can repair almost anything, which is cool. In your case, scar tissue closed up the hole but it also formed a bridge between a vein and an artery. [We see the bridge being formed.] Now, veins are supposed to help the intestine flush bacteria away, but the bridge allowed the bacteria entrance to the artery. [We see the bacteria crossing the bridge.] Where they got a free ride… everywhere.
Surgery to fix the bridge will take about 2 hours. Psychotherapy is going to take a little longer. Why'd you do it?
Technically, all you have to do is promise me that you wont do it again. Then, legally I can't tell them.
Yeah, sure.
Your daughter tried to kill herself. That's why she's here. Legally, I'm supposed to keep that between me and her. Which makes sense, she's obviously an adult, capable of her own well-reasoned decisions.
If she doesn't die in the next couple of hours, yeah, I'm right.
Everyone has secrets.
You'll make her happy?
[Nods.] Might want to try some meds, too. [Starts to leave.]
No. [Jodie is shocked. House leaves.]
Sorry. Surgery went a little late.
I can't discuss this with a dry mouth. What have you got there?
[To the barman.] I'm going to have a mug of peppermint tea please.
It's some kind of interview. You're judging me, I'm judging you.
I'm on antidepressants because a doctor friend of mine thinks I'm miserable. I don't like them they make me hazy. I eat meat, I like drugs, and I'm not always faithful to the women I date.
You do realise you just skipped over several deep character flaws that most women would run screaming from?
Yeah... I don't always do that, either.
Were you on the debating team in high school? [Barman pours House's tea.] Also... [Picking it up.] I hate tea. [Drinks it, then smiles.]
I like this kid.
I know you hate him. What more do I need to know? [addressing everyone] The kid's not a cliché. Anybody can get into a fight after losing. It takes real creativity to beat up someone you just beat.
 Hold on. [closing his eyes] I'm having a moment. This... [imitates choking back a sob] this could be Foreman's last time mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.
But not the personality disorder.
 Being a teenager excuses the odd inappropriate comment. This kid say anything appropriate? [announcing] He's having cluster headaches. Probably been having them for years. Question is, what's causing them?
ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain. Useless for this pain. It could have knocked down the swelling. Best bet is a vascular problem.
[turns around] Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
Don't you dare... touch that acerbic wit.
[vo] What do you got for me this...
... fine morning?
You accusing the symptoms of lying?
Wouldn't account for the personality disorder.
He's not getting aggressive and lethargic, he's getting aggressive and aggressiver.
Sorry. Just got dizzy there. I was expecting to turn right. It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.
Way to think outside the box.
But no fat in the ventricles. It's cluster headaches.
Good point, Foreman!
The treatments don't always work. Symptoms never lie.
[shouting into Foreman's ear] Back off, Foreman!
If the approved treatment doesn't work, we go with an unapproved treatment.
Something on your mind?
Because you totally can't tell.
Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati. Big coup. Your homies must be kvelling.
Yes.
It wasn't me.
Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.
Would it matter?
If the adult way doesn't work, why bother with it?
You're gonna be all whiny during the differential diagnoses, aren't you?
[calling after him] It wasn't me.
I only sabotage people I consider worth it.
[dramatically, pointing his cane at her] You are one evil,... cunning woman. It's a massive turn-on.
You girls can gossip later.
[takes a seat] You called New York Mercy to have Foreman's job interview killed.
[to Nurse Unger] When I said, "You girls can gossip later," I was throwing you out, but in a polite way.
Ah, you're deflecting. Only I'm allowed to do that. [drinks his energy drink]
No, just me. But I know something he doesn't. I didn't do it.
Do you want him to leave?
Were you planning on doing something?
But if he takes the job, there's nothing to be done. You had to stop him.
 Looking for a tell. Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips.
Oh! Almost forgot. I need to give a sixteen-year-old magic mushrooms to treat a cluster headache. Is that cool?
Wouldn't look that way in the court transcript. Mushrooms have psilocybins that work on cluster headaches. It's either that or cutting into his brain and going on a fishing expedition.
[pretends to think] Well, I have now. Yeah, it's definitely better that the Dean of Medicine prescribes it instead of an unhinged doctor with a history of drug use. Takes the stink off if the patient decides to put on a cape and fly off the roof.
Party on, Garth. And don't stand in Foreman's way. It's just wrong.
If you wanna curry favor with me, avoid discussions of other men's testicles.
[to the nurse] Thanks. [to Cameron] Focus on phrases like "You were right about the cluster headaches."
Okay, what causes rage, headaches, personality disorder and hypogonadism?
He's mad at me.
No reason.
Male genitals are controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. We're not talking about Foreman anymore.
If this were an employee-owned airline in Scandinavia, yes. It's not lesions. His temperature would be all over the map. Symptoms don't lie.
[jerks a nod] Biopsy the brat's pituitary. [enters the elevator] And let the record show I was right about the cluster headaches.
Which means he'll be dead long before Foreman turns in his parking pass. So, what causes personality disorder, head pain, blah-blah-blah, and liver failure?
Yes. Also, we need to figure out how symptoms yesterday can be caused by liver failure today. [steals a look at Foreman]
Ooh-aah! Whoa!
[scolding] Don't sneak up on a person like that.
Well, listening doesn't help me. Okay. Let's go with the liver and a time-machine theory. Foreman, what causes liver problems?
Most liver damage begins with what we put in our bodies. Foreman?
Cuddy?
[shrugs] Sounded like someone with back. [jerking his head towards the door] Go.
[as Foreman leaves] We'll try and muddle through without your blank stare to guide us. [to Cameron and Chase] So if it's not the bad things he's putting in, what about the good things?
Was raised. Means he's all grown up. Or he's not a vegetarian anymore.
Would if he had an OTC deficiency. Body can't metabolize nitrogen, damages the liver. Run a hamburger test.
It's exactly what it sounds like. Stuff him full of meat, wait for his ammonia levels to spike.
And you went shirtless because... skin cancer looks cool.
Lie down.
[to Mark] When daddy works on his boat, does he have a cooler with lots of brown bottles with long necks?
[filling the syringe with water] And does daddy like to lie down on his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?
[holding the syringe out to Doug] I will give you this for the... [calculates] one dollar, forty one cents in your pocket.
A psychic once told me that I'm psychic.
Hey, one of these quarters is Canadian. [mad] Give me back my syringe.
Welcome back.
Or on me. Apology accepted. [walks to the Nurse's Station] Starve him.
[tossing Doug's file on the 'station] Diabetic steatosis would screw up his liver. Starve him overnight and see if his blood sugar pops.
Not a problem. You can take him.
Which is shortening as we speak. We are looking at a Chinese menu, and we've got symptoms from too many columns. They're going to overcharge us.
So we're only gonna pay attention to _abnormal_ abnormalities?
Get the sequencing primers. See if it's one of the ones we can treat.
[whirls around] Job interview?
You do the nurse stuff, they'll do the doctor stuff.
[looks up] Yes. Those are the two options. It is... or it isn't.
[donning his jacket] Lovely disease. Degenerative, fatal, incurable. I wonder if that's why Cameron's on the "not" side.
So let's speed it up.
So you two kids will stop fighting. [removing his bag] Also, I don't feel like waiting for respiratory failure. Chase, find some way for the mother to get lost for a while. [cracks his knuckles outwards] I'm going to stress this kid until he bites off a finger.
[Greg's Anatomy's...] Dr. McCaney. The man who's gonna kick your ass all over this chessboard.
[pushing up Nate's sleeve] ...bite yourself, yeah. You need some liquid energy.
Now, if you consent, I'm gonna give you this shot of adrenaline.
Aside from being indicative of pituitary issues and certain kinds of genetic disorders, small testicles also indicate... [disposes off the syringe] that you're a big chicken. Please don't make me do the sound effect.
Didn't think I'd have to. Thought you'd just jump at the chance of humiliating someone.
[winding the chess clock] It... is... on!
Bird's opening. Passive approach.
[Slap] Sign of a coward.
[makes a move, Slap] Arrogance has to be earned.
[moving a bishop] Tell me what you've done to earn yours. [Slap]
I don't bleed out of my penis.
Check.
You know, it's a real thin line between tortured genius and awkward kid who can't get girls because he's... creepy.
To stress you out.
Check.
I'd tell you, but I figure it's more stressful if you don't know why.
You know that no one likes you, right?
[declaring] You're dying.
Check. [Slap]
Your move.
Crap.
He's having a seizure. Four milligrams IV Lorazepam.
[under his breath] I hate this kid.
You get the job?
So we've got one more symptom, one less diagnosis. [to Foreman] I assume they're gonna call for references? You give 'em my name?
Whose name did you give?
Ouch! That can't look good. [still frustrated at having been beaten] I hate this kid.
Uh-uh, it's gotta be one. It's always one.
What if he is? What if the symptoms lied?
[looking at the Ducklings] There. Now all we're looking at is a simple, evil jerk with amyloidosis.
Amyloidosis was your idea.
Yeah, it does. [now erases the crossed-out "PERSONALITY" word] Look.
You want him to be a victim because you wanna believe that people are good. And if they're not, it's gotta be a chemical problem. Except they're not, and it's not. [to Chase and Cameron] Flush him with immunosuppressants. Get a biopsy to confirm, and find him a marrow donor.
It was your idea. Don't give up on it so fast.
Is he having trouble breathing?
Could also be an amyloid buildup. Keep him on immunosuppressants and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.
[cutting him off] Look, you got two choices. Engage me in a futile argument then do what I asked, or just do what I asked.
You're not ready.
There was a third choice. Don't do what I asked. You coulda defied me, stuck the kid on antibiotics. But you didn't. Because you still trust my judgment more than your own.
[sighs] Foreman's already been over this. [clearly] It wasn't me.
And why would I do that?
[smiling] You know, [smirks] sometimes I forget why I hired you.
I cost him a crappy opportunity. New York Mercy's where you go to treat boils and cysts and build a 401K.
I don't and there'd be no point.
He doesn't need that.
We dumped one symptom. But forgot to add one.
[declaring] Revenge time, Nate.
Yes! I am. [holds his hands out, clenched] Black or white?
Pick one, or... [points to an IV bag] this comes out. And, for all you know, this is really important.
That hurts, right? Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this. You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb.
Because your bones have formed abnormally. Thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.
Actually, this stuff isn't important at all.
[waving it off] They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis. It's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.
The body absorbs iron from food, but can't process it.
Can't get rid of it. And idle iron is the devil's playground. It builds up in the organs and joints, whacking them in the process.
Caused all of the symptoms. Including something that wasn't a symptom.
Those body aches, they were not from the fighting.
[taking a scalpel] Sorry. The iron's innocent on that count. Your kid's a jerk.
And, yeah, it's probably your fault. Although, if you'd stayed off the meat like your mom said, you'd have half as much iron, and be twice less... almost dead.
Oh, nurse!
[innocently] This patient is bleeding for some reason.
He'll need dialysis. And he'll have to get his blood drained every few months for the rest of his life. My condolences. It's going to be a long and annoying life.
[leaning close to Nate] I wouldn't have taken your bishop. I'd have moved my queen to D6, defusing the threat. Then rook to E8, attacking the king's pawn. I'd have lost the exchange, but won the game.
[grumbling] Jerk.
[beat] Still running the new biopsy for amyloidosis?
Run the test again. Recheck your results.
Looks like you're in for an all-nighter.
I'm world famous now, press won't leave me alone.
I know. If it was the press I'd be answering.
She didn't book an appointment.
You don't reach terra firma, you don't get any milk or honey.
You know why I find the goodbye party fascinating? [he puts away the paper and rubs his stubbled chin] Isn't it kind of insulting to celebrate when someone leaves you?
Nothing.
Yeah.
Nothing I can do. He doesn't want more money, better working conditions, doesn't even want a better job. He wants to not be me.
He's right. [bites into a bun]
Don't. Foreman's not the only chocolate-covered cherry in the box.
8th.
That used to be true, but I changed.
This would be a lot easier if we had her medical records. Any of you certified deep sea divers?
[takes off his cap and puts it on a model of a brain] If there's one thing Castro knows is how to look great in green. [he gives pointed looks in Foreman's direction but the duckling has his back to the rest of the room and doesn't seem to see] And if there are two things Castro knows is how to look great in green and train doctors. Even without the medical records we can assume she was drowned in antibiotics before she risked drowning to see me.
How to lay his hands on high-tech scanning equipment. [points to the list of symptoms on the board] Pain, double vision, point us towards the head. Cameron get an MRI, see what's cooking in the old cabeza. [she goes out to do as asked] Chase, check out the husband.
Basic math, take all her symptoms, subtract his sea symptoms, the remainder equals her original symptoms. [Chase walks out]
He said that to you?
Foreman's not as easy as Cameron, but of course, who is?
Maybe it's something I can't offer.
He'd see through it.
I do like being productive. Well done, do it.
Go do your job.
Wow. Well either Foreman's way stronger than he thinks he is or... [he turns around, the ducklings are silent] seriously or?
Why? Because metastatic tumours don't explain the abnormal MRI, kidney damage, cotton mouth, double vision? Oh wait, they do.
It's not an infection.
Because an infection would cause a fever and the brilliant doctors who work in my office have already crossed that off the list because the husband--
Foreman didn't break her arm.
Cancer did. Put her on a PET scan, see what else is breaking. [He prepares to walk out of the room]
Anything else? When you get the results for the PET scan, let me know.
You're fired.
Because you've been here the longest, learned all you can, or you haven't learned anything at all... either way, it's time for a change.
Sure thing, first you tell me the results of the PET scan.
Would you stay if I did?
Yes.
He's not gone 5 minutes and the name-calling starts. What's on the PET scan?
Do you know what's on the PET scan?
Woah, wait! What's on the PET scan?
Yes, they are all irreplaceable. If only this country had figured out somehow to teach people to interpret PET scans.
I don't suppose you know what's on my patient's PET scan?
So that's a no?
[reluctantly picks up the phone and dials] Chase. If you know what's on the PET scan, call me back. [put the phone back down]
Sorry, you're in the wrong room. My name on the door, my team, my decisions.
[the phone rings] Hold that reprimand. [he picks up the phone] House. Doctor Chase, how are ya? [Wilson and Cuddy look on expectantly] Thank you, you are indispensable. Um, you're still fired, sorry. [puts down the phone] Wow, that was awkward. PET scan revealed a blood clot in my patient's arm which means goodbye. Still got 2 people working for me, got to get one of them to do my job. [he walks out]
Did you give an angry Cuban my home number?
What did you do?
She has no pulse but she's talking. Cough.
Cough again. Keep coughing, it'll push blood into your head, keep you conscious. [She obeys, Foreman is trying to help start her heart again through CPR] Push 1 mg epinephrine.
No, but it is amazingly cool.
We need to keep her here, if this is a clot then forcing a bypass will blow it into her brain and kill her.
What would cause the heart to stop? Let's assume it wasn't human error. [looks at Foreman]
Which is why I said assume.
Tell him what? We have no idea what happened. [he starts walking out of the room]
Keep going 'til I figure this out.
Help! I'm trapped inside a monitor!
My patient lost her heartbeat during a routine cardiac catheterisation so--
It's not human error.
Pre-procedure EKG was normal, no syncope.
Foreman said no ST segment changes.
It's not human error.
Did you just spin on the monitor? You know I can't see you. [Wilson turns back to the surgery looking perplexed] Human error would not explain her symptoms.
I mean her foot pain, her back pain...
Foreman and Cameron are doing CPR.
[from the balcony above] Excuse me, professor.
My patient has no heartbeat. Stopped when we inserted a catheter during a routine angiogram. Anyone tells me why her heart stopped gets an A in doctor Cuddy's class.
Yeah, I'm polling first year medical students because I hadn't considered human error.
Structural abnormalities would show up on the echo, you get a C.
F.
B+. Unfortunately, she missed her last botox appointment due to a boating accident, but send me your resume.
[looks at Foreman who is drenched in sweat] Good lord, you smell like muskox.
I was worried about a clot.
You can vacuum later.
Her heart stopped.
If I knew that, I'd be coming to you.
Happening. Present participle. Not a particularly interesting form of speech, kind of like of this conversation.
[takes a vicodin] Helps my process.
Well then you do not ignore your wife.
Need to look at the heart.
Can't find my wallet. Pick it up, turn it over.
Hearts don't stop for no reason.
Give her a jump start.
And again,
Again.
I'm not telling her husband anything until I can tell him why his wife--
[walks in] Can I have a hug too? Surgeon found nothing, can't start her heart. [looks at the present] What a thoughtful gift. Nice reminder of intellectual theft to hang at your new place of employment. You two can go, say hi to Chase for me. [He looks at Cameron] You're wearing lipstick.
You two have no theories about why the heart stopped. Which means I don't need you, go.
Tell him what?
Why?
How can we tell him there's no hope if we don't know why there's no hope? He's not going to pull the plug on his wife, he risked his life to get her to me. If he pulls the plug it means he's failed.
And you're ok with that? Go.
The way the security light hits your legs... looks good.
If you're here to yell at me about the Foreman-Chase situation, it can wait.
Haven't put a clock on it.
Patient's husband prefers her not dead.
This is not an act, I don't care if--
What if I can fix it? Maybe I just don't know it yet.
I don't care. I really don't care. My motives are pure - if we do an autopsy, you'll see... oops... if I'd thought of that crazy idea, we could have saved her. And then the husband might be upset.
I was told you didn't believe in God.
It's not working, she's not coming back. If you want to say goodbye, come down to the ICU, then I'll take her off bypass. I'm sorry, I should've-- [Esteban turns to House and clings to him for comfort as he cries]
[nods] Yeah.
Probably. Just not her heart.
She's not sleeping, we double-checked.
No, it's residual flow from the bypass.
QRST wave, that's a normal normal.
Holy crap.
No, it's New Jersey.
It's impossible.
Live hearts don't stop for no reason. Dead hearts don't start for no reason.
No it's not.
Just 'coz it's not there now doesn't mean it’s gone.
Antibiotics did not bring her back to life.
How come God gets credit whenever something good happens? Where was he when her heart stopped? What if it wasn't human error? What if it was God's error? A congenital defect in an artery making it susceptible to inflammation. We need to do another angiogram.
The one time we looked inside her heart we stopped before we could see anything.
Good news, we think we know what the problem is.
Hey, it's my first language, not yours. If she wants to outlive Castro, we need to fix her heart.
In case no one's filled you in, today is Monday, which means you've been dead for a day. That kind of symptom comes back it can get serious. I need to do another angiogram.
No, God caused that. He's all powerful you know.
Your rescuers didn't have wings, they had a helicopter.
You know how many little boys are praying for jet packs? How many priests are praying for... uhh, that one actually works.
I'm not going to take you away from him but if we don't do this test, God will.
Which means I was wrong. But I'm wrong all the time, my mistakes don't prove there's a God. You came a long way to see me, you going to put her life in God's hands or in mine?
Ready?
[to Esteban] I better not see you praying! I don't want to have to fight for credit on this. Exiting the femoral, entering the aortic arch.
Where we stopped to have a picnic last week.
Mine's rising too, 'course I am doing battle with a deity. [continues to concentrate on the procedure] In the heart, injecting the dye.
Either I'm right, or this test is about to go very bad.
She has one... two... third ostium. How many is she supposed to have? [turns to Marina] Dos. [That's two in Spanish] All the third one's doing is causing inflammation, throwing off clots, giving away the angiogram. No human would screw up that big! [He directs that at Esteban] Don't worry, just one more surgery and you'll be fine.
[in jest at another reference to thanking god] Don't make me slap you. [Marina laughs, Esteban looks relieved]
One more and I get a set of steak knives.
Didn't do it for you, thought you were the best guy for the job.
Which is why I want you to stay. You're an important part of the team, I need you.
I just solved a case by predicting a never before seen heart defect, a case you couldn't solve, a case you gave up on; I couldn't be happier.
The two were connected.
Do you think she cares? Do you think the husband cares? Do you think the children she can now have because of me are going to care why I saved her?
About yourself. About your own ego!
You're the selfish bastard, not me. It's why you took so much pleasure in drawing out this little goodbye of yours for the last 3 weeks, wasn't for me, wasn't for anyone, sure as hell didn't help anyone.
Nice tries are worthless.
You now have a bigger office than I do, why don't you go enjoy it.
Better be naked pictures.
What do you expect me to do? Break down and apologise? Beg Chase to come back?
Genuine American cigars, you guys can't get them in Cuba, one hundred percent healthy.
Patient follow-up, very important.
She looks great, like she's sleeping.
Two of them quit, I fired the third.
Yeah, I must be.
I don't think I am. I think I'm okay.
God only knows.
Who is this man? [Camera pans out to reveal the 40 potential fellows staring at House and the screen; they each have a number around their neck, marathon runner style.]
C'mon, take a shot. I'm not going to fire you every time you get a wrong answer.
You're fired. [23 is shocked but gets up and leaves without a word.] Does this man look like he's ceding Czechoslovakia to a fascist dictatorship?
I want seven alternate diagnoses when I get back. [Goes to talk to Cuddy who is still standing in the doorway.]
I've got a budget for three, doesn't mean I can only hire three.
I cut the permanent salaries by 10 percent, over 3 years that'll more than make up for the breakage on the 27 that I'm going to weed out over the next few weeks.
Row D, you're fired. [Everyone in Row D starts to leave, House turns back to Cuddy.] I didn't actually count all the resumes.
Sure.  [as people start filing out between House and Cuddy] and having them sitting in my office schmoozing about their favourite Algerian surfing movies, that's a much better system. Wait a sec. [Stops number 19, a pretty brunette, from leaving.] Were you in Row D?
My apologies, my boss says I'm being arbitrary and stupid. [Sticks his head back in the lecture theatre.] Row D is not fired, Row C is fired.
See? That was not arbitrary. [House's pager goes off.] Well, I'd love to chat but I've been paged. [Picks up his pager and looks at it.] That's interesting, apparently paged myself. [Leaves.]
If you have a resumé there I'm not interested, but I wouldn't mind hearing how you got my pager number.
Does One-eyed Nicky want me to run that to Jimmy the Nose?
[Sits down.] Insurance is usually cheaper than that. Cash means there's something to hide.
I discovered salt and created FM radio.
Well if it's fixable the Air Force will do it for free. If not, doesn't matter.
Well let’s say that's true. You get a new job, the hospital gets a nice wad of cash, what do I get?
[Cuts him off:] Don't care. New patient. [Turns off the projector and motions for number 6 to move it, which he quickly does.] 30 year old female, with synaesthesia. New rules. [Pulls up the projection screen to reveal a blackboard that reads 'Tesla was robbed!'] You generate a lab report – You shred it. X-ray - You melt it. No notes, no records, nothing. As far as you're concerned the patient is Osama Bin Laden and everyone not in this room is Delta Force. Any questions?
It's a metaphor. Get used to it. Any more questions?
You think her name might be connected to what's wrong with her? [Walks over to the side door, calls out like Ed McMahon.] Here's Osama! [Opens the door. Greta walks in, House gives her a chair and she sits down.] Now you all have numbers so we're going to do this, alphabetically. 8, 15 and 5. [House starts to pace around.]
What, you think I'd pull you off Buddy Ebsen just for a junkie?
You have got to trust someone, right?
Two down, Kitty Carlisle?
Why would you ask that?
That's an unusual choice.
The patient is a frequent flyer. 13, 32, 39, get Osama an EEG, MRI and an angiogram. [Those three and Greta start to leave.] How many of you think that Oswald acted alone?
Oh shut up. Split yourselves into 2 groups, test her blood, test her stool. [6 and several others leave.] Who likes the designated hitter? [Two female blonde identical twins – 15A and 15B –  put their hand up.] You're wrong, you're lucky you're not fired. 2 more groups, LP and cultures. [Twins and others leave.] Who doesn't know what a designated hitter is? [26, 2 and 10 put up their hand. House starts to write on a piece of paper] Okay, here is her address, I want you to break in, find out what she's hiding. [The three of them start to leave, 26 takes the address on the way out, 2 stops next to House]
Well, if we could find out what she's hiding just by asking we'd have to redefine hiding. You want to live in this country, learn the language. [2 leaves.]
Got a problem with the naked female form?
That's not a dolphin, it's a porpoise. There is a difference you know. [Goes back to looking at the screen] Salary for one thing.
Did you just see a blond guy with a pretentious accent?
Good point. Can I have my car keys back? [24 looks shocked and a little scared.] Give me the car keys, put the patient in a hyperbaric chamber and no more prime numbers for you. [24 gives him the keys.] Thank you. [House walks back into his office.]
So what does cause synaesthesia, high red blood cell count and heart attack?
And you didn't stop him. Means either you thought it was a chance worth taking, making you a hypocrite, or you thought he'd fail, making you a cut throat little pixie. What causes...
Stop it! This argument is distracting every male and lesbian here. You're both right, in the sense that you've convinced me that you're both wrong.
How old are you?
Okay, Scooter. Do a trans-esophageal echo, and since the positive divisors of 26 are 2 and 13 have them assist. The rest of you, go to the cafeteria and document 10 things that could cause infection. Each. [Everyone starts to leave. House takes a sip from his large soda.]
17's a stupid number. [Takes a bite.] What's Chase doing here?
Last night, outside my office.
It's more curious than actually...
Not interesting. Someone who looked like someone I used to know walked by my office.
The only thing I feel guilty for is this. [Throws what's left of the bread into Wilson's coffee.]
Got that from structurally sound.
I assume you're not all walking with me to tell me that you found nothing.
Okay, who's next?
Stop. [Moves 13 out of the way with his cane and turns to look at the group.] Okay. Here's how we diagnose in transit. I lead, you draft, I move, you move, I stop, you stop. Got it?
Wait a sec, why did you do the test? I gave it to Scooter.
It doesn't. It matters that you let her. Okay. 10, 24, 39 run a TRH stimulation test for hyperthyroidism. [Walks off. The numbers follow.]
Proving her first attack was caused by her thyroid. [Pushes the lift button with his cane.] Which is kind of the point, right? [Elevator dings. House walks in, the numbers start to follow.] Uh ah ah ah ah! [They step back.] I ride alone. [Pushes the button and the lift closes.]
Paging me during Judge Judy, not the best way to win my affections.
So you called me, the guy with one good leg and zero leverage. [Rolls his eyes and starts to walk away.]
Well luckily, violence is not the last resort. Extortion is. [Motions to 10.] So go ahead, extort her.
Clever. An appeal to her deep concern for hospital property. Let's see how that works. [Waits, nothing happens.]
You seem to be getting to her.
You think she wants to die?
I do. [House looks across and sees a blonde Cameron leaving the clinic, in slow motion. Meanwhile Greta bursts out of the Chapel. 10 and 39 catch her and she struggles to break free.]
Anybody think that a sedative might...
Okay. [24 stabs Greta in the arm and she collapses with 39 and 10 holding her up. Just then Cuddy walks up.]
Apparently only 19. Which number was it?
You know my current thoughts, right? I don't have to put those on paper. [Leaves.]
Three issues. One. Number 10, you're fired.
Well, it had to be someone who went to her home. Number 26 is half asleep, missed his afternoon nap. Obviously he doesn't feel guilt. Number 2 is here on a visa, she can't jeopardise...
And that chick's [points to 24] been pointing at you since I walked in. [10 leaves.] Issue two. What causes synaesthesia, high RBC, tachy-arrhythmia, and panic attacks? [Rubs off the blackboard.]
I also said I wanted answers.
Which brings us to issue three.
To you, I'm saying you're fired. To everyone else, I'm...
I hate tattle tales.
Now you tattled twice. Issue three. [Notices 6 still sitting there in shock.] C'mon, let’s go. [6 leaves.] Issue three, how do we do tests when we can't do tests?
If we chart, then we won't get consent. So we can't.
Her dreams depend on her not consenting. So, how do we do tests when we can't do tests? [No-one answers.] You've got an hour. [Leaves.]
How do you scan a liver without scanning a liver? And what's Cameron doing here?
No. Not interesting because not seeing. Saw. My patient won't consent to MRIs or ultrasounds, and you've dealt with more liver cancer than anyone else here.
In the lobby. I guess we could palpate the area around the liver.
She had blonde hair, why would I hallucinate that?
Mm-hmm, because, of course it's scientifically impossible for a person to go back and visit somewhere they worked.
Physics joke. Don't hear enough of those.
Any chance you could turn this creative brilliance towards my patient's liver? [House pops a pill.]
Stress... I like it. [Leaves.]
We need to stress the patient's liver.
I mean make her sick in a specific way. If her liver's given to malfunctioning, we make it malfunction.
I fired you.
I approve of your shamelessness. You're still fired. [6/9 starts to leave.] So how do we stress her liver?
Nice. But Vitamin D's metabolised by the liver and kidneys. It wouldn't tell us which one's screwed up.
I like you, number 9. [6/9 smiles, 24 is shocked.]
You a Mormon? You're wearing a ring from Brigham Young. Or did your folks just do the lawns?
Don't care. Actually I'm thanking God. You're the only non-drinker we've got. We need a control group to establish whether the liver's deterioration is within normal range. Got a big drinker, medium drinker, now I got a no-drinker.
[Stops what he is doing, half smiles and leans back.] You really think the guy who created heaven and earth cares what you put in your digestive tract?
Why not? Her dream might come true. [18 starts to leave.] All life is sacred, right?
Well that fake test, might really save her life. Would you pull an ass out of a pit on the Sabbath? [Gets up and walks over to him.] Would you or would you not pull an ass out of a pit on the Sabbath?
Good. [Goes back to his seat. 18 leaves.]
Okay. [Pushes a stop watch.] Two minutes and we go round number 5. [Pours 4 more shots.] So tell me about the magic underwear.
I'm the big drinker, doing my part for science. The interesting question is why your religious beliefs are suddenly less important than her dreams.
I know what I believe. I'm just not quite sure what you believe.
But your judgment was to say no. You used my judgment.
Rational arguments don't usually work on religious people. Otherwise there would be no religious people.
Only on Christmas and Easter. The rest of the time, it doesn't really matter.
It's not about fun! It's about the truth.
Did you just see Foreman?
[Still trying to look past Cuddy.] It's a shortcut test for hypercalcaemia. You had to have just passed him.
[Still distracted.] Patient might've been sneaking uppers. He was in a white coat, did you hire him back?
So you put her on a treadmill.
Whose idea was that?
It never is. So how old were you when your brother left home?
Why aren't you answering? Did your mother initiate the divorce? [Takes the stethoscope off 13]
Are you a Wiccan?
[Sits down in front of Greta.] Okay, hold still. [While using the stethoscope to listen to her lungs he starts gently tapping her chest.]
Auscultatory percussion. If you have a good ear, you can... [Listens.] [To 13.] You didn't have a lot of friends because you chose...
[Listens again.] You can detect not only structural details, but small, deep masses. [Flicks Greta's chest a few times then takes off the stethoscope.] Game's over. You either have lung cancer or tuberous sclerosis. We need to cut you open and biopsy... [Greta starts shaking her head.]
I never opened for Springsteen or slept with Barbara Feldon. You can live for years without dreams. Without lungs...
Okay. As long you keep saying it strongly, you won't die. [Goes to get up, Greta stops him.]
How do we force a patient into surgery? Texas bag scam? Saratoga wire? Paris exposition trip?
[Smiles.] It's a myth that fake hooters blow up at high altitude, she'll be fine. Just think of it as one giant rack for mankind.
Would you condemn this woman to a life where people look at her face when they talk to her?
Can I explain why you're here?
I scheduled a diagnostic patient for a boob job, which is ridiculous. So obviously you had to confront me.
But I'm going to give you a reason.
No. Not even close to a good one. But here's the drag from your point of view. My explanation will make sense. Not to the board, not to a judge, but to you. So you'll let me do it. Then you're going to have to sit next to me at the administrative hearing. Don't you have better things to do? [Cuddy thinks for a minute then starts to leave but hesitates and turns back.] It's in the best interests of the patient. [Cuddy leaves.]
[Sticks something into Greta.] Deflate the lung.
Probably the same if not more on the left lung. Okay, so what's been working overtime to kill Miss Bin Laden?
Yeah, but I forgot it. Say the magic word and get immunity from the next challenge.
She would've had multiple seizures by now.
Wouldn't explain the red blood cells. C'mon. Cysts, synaesthesia, heart attack. You guys have gotten...
[Leans over to 39 and says quietly.] Do you see a blond guy who still has peach fuzz standing up there? [39 nods.] [To Chase.] This is a closed procedure, gallery's off limits.
Not a chance. I love you guys. Dig out the cysts, histology to confirm Von Hippel-Lindau. Don't forget her chesticles. [Looks back up but Chase has gone.]
Calling Arizona, that was a very nice touch.
Not only do I not have residual feelings, I didn't even have primary feelings.
You lied!
It meant nothing! I saw him because he was there. [Wilson gives up.] Did Cameron follow her beshert to the surgery department?
Foreman. Is he back in neurology?
No. [Leaves.]
Relax. She doesn't have to tell and neither do you. Turns out that NASA doctors even know where the hyphen in Von Hippel-Lindau goes.
I'm not an idiot. Those shuttles fly over New Jersey. [House leaves, Greta starts to cry.]
So here we are. The big moment. Which of you gets to live to be abused another day. And which of you goes home and rationalises being fired as character building? [Pops a pill.] Following numbers, thanks for playing. 21, 19, 8, 34, 17, 29, 5, 36, 2... Rest of you, 8:00 A.M. Sharp. I'll be in sometime between 10:00 and 3:00. [Everyone starts to leave.] But 26, stick around awhile. [2 walks over to House.]
Lots of people did nothing wrong.
Other people took chances. 26. [Waves him over. 2 leaves.]
Yeah, I know. How old are you?
You don't think it's relevant?
How about the fact that you never went to medical school? Which is why you let the unlucky number do the trans echo. At least you're ethically unethical.
You had to know I'd find out sooner or later.
I can't hire you as a doctor. But you can still tell me what you think. You can also fetch me coffee, pick up my dry-cleaning, until I can decide whether or not to keep you.
Assistant sounds marginally less demeaning.
Actually it is. It's just not your dream title. [House leaves.]
You're an idiot.
The hair makes you look like a hooker. I like it. Pulling pieces of windshield out of car accident victims and reattaching fingertips sliced off cutting bagels. At least Chase's move is only one step down.
I don't know who's been gossiping about ethics instead of sex, but I hope they've already been fired. Which number was it?
Number!
I didn't rat her out.
Suppose I should tell her that before she keys my car.
Had to stop some leaky faucets.
It was no one's business.
She's going to be the safest astronaut up there. Certainly more vigilant than the guy next to her who's got no clue about the aneurysm in his head ready to pop.
You got a better reason?
Would you mind holding my metaphor for a second?
New patient. Thirty-seven-year-old male, suffers from severe ascending muscle weakness.
To see who'd put up with it.
No, I was going to fire everyone who stuck around. But since everyone stuck around....
Twenty-eight percent curvature of the spine has caused reduced lung capacity, and he has reduced bone mineral density.
You have just given state secrets to the enemy.
(brisk) New patient. New rules.
Today you're going to split yourselves into two teams.
The first to figure out what's threatening to deprive the patient of the twenty or so miserable years he's got left with SMA gets to keep their jobs. (beat) Take off your numbers. You look stupid.
And I think I know who you are by now.
Good question, Overly Excited Former Foster Kid. There's ten of you. I was thinking... six against six? No, wait...
Excellent suggestion, Fat Twin. More interesting than Evens versus Odds, less interesting than Shirts against Skins.
(announcing) If your sex organs dangle, you're the Confederates. If your sex organs are aesthetically pleasing, you're the Yanks.
Do your sex organs dangle, (beat) Cutthroat Bitch?
Sounds logical. (beat) If you don't think about it for more than three seconds. But I just told you that if the danglers lose, they're out.
So, I can only assume you're hiding the real reason.
You don't think the women will be aggressive enough, will be good enough at science. They'll be too emotional.
(shrugging) If the danglers are okay, I'm okay.
Wow! You really need a shave.
You see what I did there.
Whoa.
Interesting.
Need a crash cart in here!
(holding up his hands) I didn't do it.
My offices are being used by my teams.
Which means this is the only place where you can yell at me.
Two of them. I wanted to deal with the yelling today because I noticed what you were wearing and I wouldn't have to listen all that closely.
(reasonably) Without competition, we'd still be single-celled organisms. (beat) Can I go now?
I have seven of the finest minds on it, along with three very special...
Ah. I tell you; you tell them; game's over.
Well, then, in that case... I don't know.
Why would a guy voluntarily shove a metal object into an electrical socket?
I'd fire them all, hire forty new fellowship applicants, start the game all over again.
It'd be pretty irresponsible if I didn't, wouldn't it?
(musing) If you're going to try to take yourself out, (closes the knife) why choose electricity? You'd eat a bullet (flick) or jump off a building...
(refusing to be distracted) ...bury yourself alive in Cuddy's cleavage.
It could have been a suicidal gesture, as opposed to an actual attempt.
Who puts their internal organs on a skillet just to get attention?
(to the empty air) Well, that would be cheating.
Patchy infiltrates on the x-ray. Patient improved with chest PT and oxygen, consistent with aspiration.
So now we have another symptom to explain - why does his throat think his lungs are his stomach?
And why are your throats closing up?
If you think I'm going to run two differentials at this time of the morning.... Grumpy, you're first.
Why would I call you that if you weren't?
You practice medicine overseas?
(expansively) Ta-da!
David Blaine hides the six of hearts in a beer bottle, it's still impressive.
(challenging) You like exotic. Why are you here?
Parents sick?
(interrupts) This is not the job you want. This is the job in the ZIP code you want. You engaged?
(expansively, but softer) Ta-da!
You're allowed to. People usually don't.
So if it's nothing new, what caused the old?
(abruptly) So, he's all better, Woman Who... (shrugs) Thirteen.
(searching) That's a pretty passive approach for the daughter of an alcoholic.
Then why haven't you?
Six against four. One of the men is going to have to join the women's team.
On the other hand, one of the men isn't an actual doctor, so... I guess it's pretty fair.
Men, you're in the penalty box.
I'm glad you asked about that.
Reason I'm penalizing you is time management.
In Diagnostics, you're always working against the clock. The women came up with a theory and they treated the patient. You guys just sat around in a lab, hoping a series of blind tests would GIVE you a theory. You wasted the patient's time. (takes another sip of coffee) Now I'm going to waste yours.
Can't let you leave if they think you're still... suicidal.
(quietly sarcastic) No, that's right. You were just trying to kill the wall. (pause) I check this box, and your next roommates are gonna be Jesus and Crazy McLoonyBin. That guy never had a chance.
Suddenly you're shy? (moves to Almore's side) You pooped your pants in front of me. (beat) It's one of the nasty side effects of dying.
(taking a deep breath) Okay. Here's what happened. Your oxygen-deprived brain was shutting down. A flood of endorphins and serotonin was released. That's what gave you the visions.
(flip) Nope.
Who are you, Thirteen?
The fact that you won't answer my questions tells me more about you than answers could.
Do you think that non-answers tell me anything?
Tell me you're hiding something.
Tells me you've got something worth hiding. Some Turkish prison, gay porn... ya killed a man just because he was asking too many questions.
No need. See you in an hour or so. Got to... set some stuff up.
Thank you all for coming... to Tribal Council. (to Cole) Man of your integrity, I feel I can trust... Big Love. And I don't call you that because you are a Mormon. (winks broadly as Cole grimaces) So, where's your team's sixth man?
You also sinned. You have no right to cast the first stone.
The rules said 'no talking'.
Out loud.
Key word being 'trying'. Tilt table test confirmed that you guys were wrong. You're fired.
Ah, the Prodigal Son returneth. You're also fired.
Good for you. It's too bad you're wrong. Straightening indicates weakening, not hardening. SMA explains the weakening. (takes back his stick, give Amber back the film) Strongyloides infection explains everything else. (indicates the rest of the women) You ladies have the honor to give the patient a feeding tube, discharge him, and show up for work tomorrow. The rest of you... you're a disappointment. You make me want to stop dangling.
I think I will miss you most of all, Ridiculously Old Fraud.
Is he a Vulcan? If no, what makes Nimoy bleed green?
Because that would be stupid. And while she may be manipulative, borderline evil, shallow...
Ten points. (puts his cane on the desk and goes to the board) 'k... let's add kidney failure to our list of symptoms.
(irritated, turns to Kutner) I'm going to fire the next person who asks me who I'm going to fire.
Forget the game.
(losing patience) I mean, forget the damn game! Guy's kidneys are failing. We need to diagnose exactly...
YOU were diagnosing. Now I am too. (beat) I thought that Thirteen was right about the Strongyloides. (picks up his cane) I was obviously wrong. (the moment of self-recrimination over, House continues in his 'differential' voice) Okay, kidney failure, aspiration, fainting... go!
Put him on IV Ampigen.
Do a skin biopsy. Get a side of lymph node to confirm.
I could have you fired!
Which proves that I can.
No. That doesn't change the fact...
Because performing tests for someone who is not a doctor in this hospital...
(to Brennan) And you're here to say?
Cervical lymph node has black flecks.
You say nothing? I say cancer.
(suspiciously) Who told you?
(nods) Good.
Thought we were dancing.
Cervical lymph node is a garbage dump. A very small one. Just one truck comes in and it only comes from one home. Al Gore would be appalled. The home...
On my way.
Right. Because I don't want to remove a little tiny piece, sit in a lab, and confirm what I already know, while my patient drowns in his own fluid. (beat) But if you want me to, I absolutely will.
It's taking college courses. (yelling) Hey, Wilson! I'm going to cut some cripple's eye out! Want to come watch?
We good to go?
Hail. Locusts. Smiting of the firstborn. Course, it all depends on how evil you've been.
If they do, they're wrong. This is the answer. It's the only way to help you.
Get out and go where? You think you're gonna sprout wings and start flying around with the other angels? Don't be an idiot. There is no 'after', there's just 'this'.
His beliefs are stupid.
(holds out his hand, exasperated) Hi! Greg House.
(sarcastically) Are there 72 virgins too?
He shouldn't be making a decision based on a lie. Misery is better than nothing.
Oh, God, I am TIRED of that argument! I don't have to go to Detroit to know that it smells.
That was the whole idea.
I wanted to NEARLY kill myself. Is he... better?
You insisted that I needed to see for myself.
(also refusing to be distracted from his original thought) What, was he discharged?
Not that guy. The guy in the car accident. With the knife. I... I need to talk to him.
Eosinophilic pneumonia...
Nothing. Who's idea was that?
Which one's Brennan? Is he the ridiculously old guy?
If it's aggressive enough, it might have gotten past the steroids. Start him on cyclophosphamide.
I love you.
Going to see our patient.
Dead is not a diagnosis.
Shut up. And give me my cane.
Should I fire myself, too? I thought it was Strongyloides, then I thought it was cancer. Little help here.
Because if I pooped myself in front of Wilson, I'd never hear the end of it.
You always had that phone in your hand.
If I died, you'd never get the job. I knew you wouldn't let that happen.
Think this is starting to come back to me. Right, left, then repeat.
Yeah, that works.
What did we miss?
So, that's it? You're just gonna give up?
Thank you. Patient seemed... better, 'til his blood turned green.
The patient didn't respond to antibiotics or steroids.
What's wrong with the dog?
(to Thirteen) Did you watch him take the pills? (she looks at him blankly) The ivermectin. Did you watch the patient put them in his mouth and swallow them?
What kind of dog is that?
It's in the Collie family, right?
They share the MDR-1 gene.
What happens when you give a dog with the MDR-1 gene ivermectin?
Look familiar? I think the last time you saw it, it didn't have that dead dog's teethmarks on it.
(harshly) When I asked you if you watched the patient swallow the pills, the right answer was 'no'. (stares implacably into her eyes) Take his body down to the morgue.
Feeling much better, thank you.
He died because a doctor made a mistake. He was an idiot.
You think it's fair that I fired all the other members of your team when you guys actually came up with the right diagnosis?
You know he'd be alive.
His dog'd be alive.
You forced us to act on a false assumption.
Everything we built from that step on. Every test. Every theory. Every treatment.
If I was going to fire you, I wouldn't be giving you the lecture. I know you're not going to let anything like this ever happen again. (pause) I'll see you tomorrow.
And I'm sorry to say... I told you so.
Today, we are hunting for the cat burglar of diseases. Causes a healthy man's lungs to fail, leaves no fingerprints.
No hyperinflation on the X-ray.
No hives. No erythema on the skin. [Cuddy and Foreman walk in.]
Embolisms don't magically dissolve. [To Foreman.] What are you doing here?
Good idea. You've been tremendously helpful, you can leave.
Well I fired him. To infinity.
She did, I said no.
Foreman goes!
Oh, uh, just in case I need them, where exactly will Dr. Foreman be keeping my balls? [Foreman rolls his eyes and looks at Cuddy, who smiles and leaves.] If you want to keep your jobs, that never happened. The only way to get the cat burglar is to catch him in the act. Give the patient a methacholine challenge, see if it sets off laryngospasm.
Well, only until you can figure out why. After that it'd be irresponsible. [The numbers leave, Foreman stays.] You and I should talk.
Yes she did! She had to establish her dominance in front of them, limit my power.
Well, that's not the never-say-never Dr. Foreman I know. There's lots we can do.
I can make you miserable.
Until you quit, again. So why don't we just skip the middleman?
My god, not everything's about you, and your little job, and your little world. This is about restoring order in the universe.
You're going to be miserable.
Carry on, he's the boss. [Sits down between 13 and Kutner.]
Weird, though... That he's the boss. Didn't he quit recently? Was it a money issue?
No that wasn't it, it was something else... Was it bling account? Med plan didn't cover tattoo removal?
Oh! I remember. You don't want to turn into me. Right? You didn't want to become evil.
Absolutely. I'm just flattered. In a few short weeks, seems like I've just turned towards the light. I mean... either that or you've sold your soul.
Get a raise? 'Cause then you're a whore. Or didn't you? 'Cause then you're a stupid whore. [House's pager goes off.] Patient just crashed. [Everyone just sits there.] Can they go, boss? [Foreman nods. They run off.]
But?
Well, then, I'll see you at the reunion. [Stands up to leave.]
I decided you're right. You're obviously in an impossible position. There's no point in me humiliating you.
So I'm going to humiliate Cuddy, until she fires you.
Well. [Cole runs past.] If the name was Attila Von Weinerschnitzel, I'd say you might be on to something.
[Studies the board.] No.
Munchausen's patients create symptoms, not names.
He's in a lab coat. Munchausen's pretend to be patients, not doctors. He's got mirror syndrome.
Do you know another mirror syndrome? Brain's got no idea who he is, where he is or what he is. But it fills the holes with whatever dirt's lying around. He reads a name tag, he's got a name. Sees a doctor, he's got a job. Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.
Well if it's simple, then we discharge the nut bar. But if it's complicated, then the nut bar has got brain damage.
No, we let him jerk you around. There's a faster way.
Mind if we play through?
What's going on here, Martin?
Excellent question. Who are you, Martin? [Patient opens his mouth to talk but says nothing.] He just likes to watch, do stuff.
Of course you are. [To the patient.] It's lecture time.
Was that it? I think you can go a lot deeper here. I mean, WHY am I so obsessed by all of this?
Good idea. I'll have him sort my mail.
I think we just found out.
[Looks up at Foreman in the observation room as the patient grabs a scalpel.] Told you I didn't need you.
[Cuts the patient's hand with a scalpel]
 Your blood's turned to sludge. If we don't heat you up, you're going to die. [Looks up at Foreman.] Can't fake that!
Mirror syndrome patients have no agenda, no axe to grind. They can read you because they have to. Moods, attitudes, everything. They're like mind readers. Except they can read your mind.
Unfortunately, we have to cure him. His hand wasn't black when he came in, the operating room was sterile, the only thing different was the temperature. Cold agglutinins means...
You'd better find it fast. This guy feels another cool breeze, his blood turns to slop and he drops. [Walks into the cafeteria.] I need three ways to pinpoint infection.
Blood's clumpy. Nothing you can do with it.
Good, what else?
Good. [House stands on a chair.] Uh, ladies and gentlemen, I have a regrettable announcement. Kitchen has just learned that our annual shipment of mayonnaise was improperly stored, so anybody who ate... well, the food, should head across the lobby to the clinic right away. Ask for Dr. Cuddy. [Everyone starts to leave.]
It's her building, her doctors. Still need one more.
Mail order. I've seen the diplomas. Two N's in university. [Everyone continues to leave.] Big Love was right. History's the key.
The key is the key. He had car keys in his pocket when he was admitted. [To Amber.] Keep him in the isolation room, so he doesn't pick up extreme bitch syndrome from one of the nurses. [To 13.] Run the ultrasound [To Taub.] and the blood cultures.
No one's keeping score... You're losing. [To Cole.] Search the street where he was mugged, find the car and the registration.
Because if you deal with the patient, he's going to wind up singing Osmond songs and proposing to five nurses at once.
Ooh. We have a love connection. [House leaves.]
Solid.
Yes, I needed a smug oncologist...
I hate you. Tell me why.
Any country with that low an age of consent and that high a rate of suicide isn't thinking straight.
It was a surgery. You were the surgeon. In that setting...
Go ahead, ask.
I want all my personal private doctors back right now. Except for Foreman.
Lesion on the liver. Possibility... Why are you doing a pelvic for food poisoning?
Lesion on the liver, ideas?
If he bleeds out we'll know what he had.
Two diagnoses out of three he lives. We do nothing three out of three he dies. [To Brennan.] Go stick his liver.
You need him to draft your letter of resignation?
What? No, that would be childish. This is what I'm doing to get back at Cuddy. [Turns around to the clinic full of people.] Who here doesn't have any health insurance? [A bunch of people stick up their hand.] Michael Moore was right. MRI's, pet scans, neuro-psych tests, private rooms for all these patients. Fight the power!
This makes no sense.
I'm not talking about the infection. I'm talking about you letting Tonya Harding administer the treatment.
Why?
And you realised I'm right just now?
The patient's nuts.
The patient is nuts.
You're nuts. You're going to be miserable, at home, at work, somewhere. The goal in life is not to eliminate misery, it's to keep misery to the minimum.
You said you came back to get married. What does your fiancée do?
Uh-huh, well I'm sure Thailand will have courts any day now. Someone's going to be miserable sometime. Accept it. It's how I stay so happy.
You're good. Don't screw it up just because you're miserable.
Rash worse equals cold agglutinins worse. Means what was in his liver wasn't fungus.
Which you [Points at Brennan] mistook for a cool fungus that you saw after the tsunami.
You saw what you wanted to see, not what was there. Wait a second. Didn't you quit?
Of course you are. Because you're the exact right amount of miserable.
Or... we can get an accurate history. [Dials a number on his phone.]
Well, that'll be a good solace to the widow X.
That's why I sent two of you. One of you breaks in, the other posts bail.
Not a problem. You know how to kill dogs, right?
Or... we get an accurate history.
You guys ever heard any of my metaphors yet? Come on. [Sits down on the edge of the desk.] Sit on grandpa's lap as I tell you how infections are criminals, the immune system's the police... Seriously, grumpy, get up here. [Pats the desk beside him.] It'll make us both happy. [Brennan looks unsure of whether to go or not but stays put.] Anyway, cops don't just let crooks run free. They keep fingerprints, mug shots. The immune system does the same thing, only it calls them antibodies. We find out what diseases he's had in his life, good chance that'll tell us where he's been in his life. Alice. [Points to Kutner.] Your turn through the looking glass. Draw blood and CSF.
What do you have?
Probably lived in the Ohio river valley.
Weak means older. Means he moved to Ohio from the San Joaquin valley.
Central America.
Yes! You're right, buzz kill. This tells us next to nothing. But since that's on the something side of nothing, thought we'd go with it.
So we take his body out of the picture. Let's hit it from the inside. Lipopolysaccharide.
Or make him just toasty enough to keep his blood flowing free. Like my bowels. You smell that? Not going to get sweeter.
But you are. You used to like this stuff. You left here because you didn't like what you were turning into. You like who you are now? You like being Cuddy's errand boy? [Flushes as Foreman leaves.] That was just a courtesy flush. I'm not actually done.
Unless you're willing to don a white T-shirt and hop into the hot tub with him, I need another way to keep him warm, or he dies.
I could cure him.
Are you going to fire me?
Wait a second. What the hell was that? You were won over by my soaring rhetoric? I basically just threatened to hold my breath... You never intended to stop me. You just pretended to stop me, so you could pretend to fail to stop me, so you could stroke my ego. Uh-Uh. War doesn't end till Foreman's gone.
And... I know when my Vicodin isn't Vicodin. Do you know when your birth control pills aren't birth control pills? [Leaves Cuddy looking worried.]
So now you've electrocuted yourself and set a patient on fire. I like the dedication.
Yeah, it was. The insult comes now. You're insane! You either have an aversion to towels, or you want pain. I think both. I'm thinking it goes back to high school gym...
Sure, why not?
Do them again. Quadruple run time. [Everyone starts to get up.]
No! That's a terrible idea. Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his heart. Come on, I'll join you.
I got you a job. Mount Zion hospital in Boston.
Gilchrist said he'd take you anyway.
Oh, god. Does everything have to be about you? It's simple math. I'm not going to back down. You're not going to back down. Cuddy's not going to back down. No one's going to be happy here. And Cuddy's going to end up pregnant. [Elevator dings.]
Doesn't matter.
Starts Monday. I could help you pack.
What? Why not? You're miserable.
Well, you're gonna be. [Foreman smiles.] Are you smiling?
Do your own stupid biopsy.
[Looks inside the box.] No need for the heart biopsy. I now know exactly who he is and what he has. You saved his life.
No, you idiot. It's vapour rub and lunch receipts.
It's 8:00 at night. The biopsy will be faster. Not fast enough to save him, but that's hardly the point. [13 and Cole start to leave.] Thirteen. [They both turn around.] [To Cole.] Is your name Thirteen? [Cole leaves.] Why did you volunteer to go street walking?
A black Mormon could help that way. There's no reason for you to want to be there. Which means there's a reason you didn't want to be here. Didn't want to look in the mirror?
Hi. Cuddy called. She needs you to iron her shirts. We'll take over. [Pushes 13 forward.] Go ahead. [Motions for Foreman to leave. He does so. 13 moves close to the patient while still putting her gloves on.] Talk to him.
Come on. Make him feel comfortable.
I'm not here, deal with her. [13 smiles.]
I'm not the alpha here. She is. She's my boss.
Increase the drip. If... you think that's the right thing to do.
Hey. Get in there, see how he's doing.
Well, apparently, it's impossible to see anything else while I'm in there. I'm a blinding white hot light of power.
No, I'm not interested in how he's doing. I'm interested in how she's doing. So get in there and tell me how he's doing.
You're a powerful, dominating man, but who knows?
Yes, you're going to get fired right now unless you get in there... [13 walks out.]
And how is he?
I know. But how is he? Bitter? Sexually frustrated?
Fine. Soak him again.
No, you love hot tubs. Find the rest of the gang, tell them to meet me at the lecture hall.
What did you say?
He likes. Who else was in there?
You didn't think to mention that?
It's not. What it is, is the water hit him and he had a thought. Not about you, but about him. We need to splash him some more.
You look familiar.
My name's Robert Elliot. I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.
Stuff.
What brings you to New Jersey? Is it work or vacation?
What type of work?
I eat out a lot. In a lot of restaurants. [Opens the box starts pulling out receipts.] Knotty Pine. Ritchies.
They're good, huh?
For what?
You on the road a lot?
[Pulls out the vapour rub.] You ever use this stuff? I use it all the time.  [Smells it.]
Yeah. I just said that. You know, the cool thing about this stuff is... You can do a lot with it. Soften your skin, treat scrapes. Naughty stuff. [House holds it out for the patient. The patient takes it and rubs some under his nose then breathes in deeply.] Why did you do that?
You're saying you like the smell?
Something else does smell like dung?
You guys ready? Now is the time you stare at me, in slack-jawed amazement. He sells farm equipment. [They look surprised.] See? Pig lagoons, pig farms. [Takes off the jacket.] And, as every child knows, where you have pigs, you have pig poo. [Roughs up his hair.] But as very few children know, where you have pig poo, you have eperythrozoon infection.
This time tomorrow, he'll be back to his old self. Whoever that might be.
Hi, I'm the guy who saved your life.
She doesn't fire me, she never will fire me, she needs me.
She's hot for me. Always...
You lose.
You all suck. The two of you, [Points to Cole and 13] took 14 hours to find a car. You, [Kutner.] forgot to mention that the guy with no memory, had memories. You [Brennan.] keep on thinking, that insane guys have hidden wisdom. You're going to wind up shooting people on the subway. [Looks at the other two.] Something.
It's a tie.
All of you.
None of you are fired. [The numbers breathe a big sigh of relief. Everyone standing at the back leaves disappointed, except Chase who smiles.]
Sure.
They're good doctors.
He's a good doctor.
50%... How bad you want to keep your job?
Hey.. You actually do want to stay, don't you?
Every one of those idiots got some insight about themselves from the pig salesman. Not one of them did anything about it. People don't learn, they don't change, but you did. You're a freak! [Foreman laughs.]
Good.
(still staring intently) I mean... go on.
Yeah, we know. We're doctors.
(incredulously) That's yourself? (grimaces) Fascinating case. (rises) I will see you again after I have saved his life. (takes the file from Cuddy) Have a warm bath waiting.
You following me?
If I do that, won't I bump into you?
(summoning patience) You know, it's a joke. (falsely sincere) See, I became a doctor because of the movie 'Patch Adams'.(considers) Uh, listen, do you want to get ahead of me, maybe back up, I don't know, low down, makes me look more powerful...
(oozing faux charm) Yeah. Also my eyes look better in...
...rooms with summer colors.
(unrepentant) Would it be better if I checked out your wardrobe and questioned your ass?
There is no little part of you.
You using force on me is... intriguing. (glances outside her office) On the other hand, cameras make people act. Sometimes like human beings, sometimes just weird, sometimes they wear open-tipped bras.
Less obvious point is that I need my team (glances again at the crew)to be unafraid of the metaphorical fart.
Sorry about that. Private. (glares back at Cuddy) She waxes her mustache once a month... sometimes gets some pretty gnarly ingrown hairs.
Where's Foreman?
Good. Come on, let's go for a walk.
(with faux drama) Walks look good on camera. They give the illusion of the story moving forward.
New patient.
Sixteen-year-old boy with second-degree...
...infranodal heart block, post-arrest.
Certainly not light-headedness.
Not in front of the company.
I'm making a music video. Come on, move faster, more energy.
Because... he would object to what I'm about to do.
(to the tech) Hey buddy! [The patient raises his head curiously.] You stay in there. (points at the patient)We'll be out here making sure he doesn't move again. (to the universe) Gah! FINALLY hear myself think. Our patient has...
Because she has way more diagnostic experience than the other swimsuit models I was considering. (references the file) Our patient has a frontonasal encephalocele with a midline cleft. (raises a picture) Ew. Don't stare directly at it. (hands it to Thirteen) So, what caused Big Head's heart to stop?
Wrong. Sixteen years they've been testing that insane noggin to death.
That sixteen years of testing didn't show?
Hey hey! You want fair, you picked the wrong job. The wrong profession. (pauses to think) The wrong species. Forget the deformity. Treat the patient like he's any other really, really ugly kid.
Nice. You're right about the habit, you're wrong about the substance. (indicates the pic) Blackened skin under the nose equals frostbite from huffing Freon. Freon's toxic, damages the heart.
Do a nuclear study. If I'm right, you'll see scarring of the heart.
Yes. This is a real offer.
I think she might be an idiot.
But she can't be an idiot. She's in the CIA, for God's sake.
She had good ideas in Langley.
She was able to identify that they were good ideas.
She's new. She's nervous.
She said one dumb thing in the differential.
They ALL say dumb things in differentials.
I can't! I just hired her. She left a career.
Well, then give me something better. What's causing heart block?
If it was toxoplasmosis, we'd've seen enlarged lymphs. And because you're not pretty enough to be an idiot, you must know that already. Which means you just said it because you want to do an LP for intracranial pressure.
Wait. I'm not done. You thought I wouldn't catch on, which means either you think I'M an idiot, which is flattering, doing my hair differently, or ...
(to Kutner) How could you POSSIBLY think that I was done? I prefaced that with an 'either'. It needs an 'or'. (to Taub) Or you ARE an idiot. Which is possible. I'm not great at judging men's looks.
Who cares if you're dead? It's how you look. Well, since you've given me nothing better, we're back to drugs.
Decreased uptake on the membranous septum.
But nothing's nothing. Do an EP study.
Too bad you guys are going for a theatrical release. Vomiting blood would have made a great act-out. Likely causes?
No pallor. No melena. (scornfully) Why are you wearing a tie?
Nice lipstick.
Bad idea.
The hemorrhage came after the block.
Anybody here more interested in the medicine and a little less interested in the paparazzi?
Good.
Yeah. But other than that. Real good.
I just said it wasn't a nasal tumor.
Finally! Someone who is NOT just a pretty face. You and Taub, run the 'scope, find the tumor.
Liver is the one organ you can't ascribe to intracranial pressure.
Hey, hey, hey hey! [House puts his face into the shot. Very annoyed.] You have an all-access pass to the case, not my Fave Five. So go.
Come on, come on - let's go!
I think I'm going blind.
She said something idiotic again and I didn't even notice it. It took Foreman to point out that it was idiotic. She's making ME an idiot.
No, I think it's something systemic.
She killed a PATIENT.
The bitch is a bitch.
The bitch? She's a BITCH.
Nope, Elephant Boy just vomiting up blood again.
Yeah.
Nope. Where are the nosebleeds? Where's the labored bleeding? You were right about me being wrong. You're wrong about you being right. (to the room) I need new ideas. Anybody.
Does it bother you...
...that this kid's gonna die because you won't put down that camera?
At all? You know?
(sarcastically patient) No. Now they're too worried about looking BAD.
(out of the corner of his mouth) Foreman? Does that make sense?
Hey. Say what she just said.
Go look for signs of retinal degeneration.
Take him with you, so he can see the degeneration too.
Absolutely.
Absolutely not.
Swelling means there's increased pressure. You get a gold Star of David for proving that...
...yes, this kid has a big head and big heads cause pressure. Doesn't explain the liver.
JRA explains all of it, including the liver. One theory's better than two.
Treat with steroids.
You really want to lose this argument in front of the camera?
I AM sure. (turns) It's JRA.
And why would he even doubt that, unless a FORMER fellow of mine was chirping in his ear.
Why did you take this job?
You had a perfectly good plastic surgery practice... lots of money.
The temptation to come screw with me just too much for you? There's got to be a better reason.
Oh, and I think I mentioned this earlier - you're fired.
To do what I always do in these situations.
Treat my patient behind his back.
Just a warning. If we have to start getting consent every time we do a procedure, soon they'll be asking for INFORMED consent.
Uh... gosh. Uh... there's so many things.
Ah... is Dr. Taub available? Because he was very highly recommended....
Do you know why he left?
Oh, my Goodness! Is he okay?
'cause... because my friend had his ears done by Dr. Taub. Should he worry that they may... pop back?
You know that toe... next to the big toe? Mine's bigger than my big toe. Is there any way to shorten it? Or make my big toe bigger? Like a toe-gmentation? (inquiring) Did he lie, cheat, or steal?
What gave me away? Was it my obviously perfect feet?
Hi!
Let's go!
Skipping three scenes. CT's back. (indicates Taub) He's gonna say that there's evidence of an anomaly, I'm gonna say he's wrong, he's gonna go back to the father, and we'll all end up here.
Or it's a sign of increased pressure from JRA.
Dr. Taub would rather distract you from the truth...
... with sparkly things like four-carat diamonds.
Your partner said...
...that you left for personal reasons. But your wife said you lost a patient.
See, that confused me.
Why would you give her a diamond if you screwed somebody else over? If you screwed HER over, I mean that could... I....
Just asked questions.
If you could be a bit more descriptive, I'd be happier.
Wow! You are ugly.
I know. That's why you're ugly.
But you're a lucky boy. Anywhere else in the animal kingdom, your parents would have eaten you at birth.
Your son needs steroids.
Dr. Cuddy agrees.
He's not a real doctor. He's a plastic surgeon. All he cares is that your son looks good in his COFFIN.
You shouldn't care if I care.
Because... I don't think the surgery's important. You're putting your trust in someone who DOES think the surgery's important. You're willing to take chances, to risk your son's life for something he doesn't need?
But not on film. All their camera equipment's in here.
Blue the janitor.
That's his name.
Owe him an apology.
Just watch twenty minutes of this stuff, tell me if I'm out of my mind.
(ONSCREEN) Foreman, does that make sense?
What did you miss? She screwed up, I didn't...
(ONSCREEN) Good.
What am I going to do?
I'm gonna to keep her around because she makes me an idiot?
You think he's gay?
(ONSCREEN) I just said it's not a nasal tumor...
I can't believe I'm that guy.
I'm not every guy.
I'm not all guys.
Cameron was smart.
Did you just insult me in Pig Latin?
You're right. I didn't see that before. [House looks down at Taub.] Come on. Let's go!
Hey.
I know you think you're feeling better... on account of feeling better, but this trusted family doctor thinks that he's found a masked lesion, so if you could lie back down and struggle to breathe....
(to Taub) Look at that.
His little finger. It's twitching.
Just give it a second.
There.
He's not better.
My diagnosis. I don't know what he has.
Cancel the surgery.
New symptom. Involuntary muscle movement.
The body doing something it's not supposed to do is the DEFINITION of a symptom.
Or he's not.
Or the steroids have just tempered his condition.
You get a haircut, and still got bad hair.
On the other hand, if he has Lyme Disease, there would be other subtle clues, like a huge, target-shaped rash. But thanks for playing.
Taub thinks that acetaminophen does.
If I'm right, his heart will stop.  (beat) Kutner, keep the paddles on stand-by.
Another chance to blow someone up.
Absolutely.
He's convinced he's sure. Whereas, I care about your son, and have therefore brought a professional defibrillist.
What you do mean, 'Thank God'?
(over his shoulder) God's the guy who gave it to him.
I have a new theory. Her bad ideas don't indicate a lack of intelligence, they indicate an open mind, the willingness not to be trapped by conventional....
Tell me something I don't know.
You DO realize that 'tell me something I don't know' is just an expression.
You think that just because she's as beautiful ... ergo...
...you think that because she hasn't had a decent idea....
Yes. It was JRA. I'm very proud.
Would you just hold up some fingers so I can see if I'm literally blind? We ruled out Lyme Disease HOURS ago.
I am so ashamed. (to Wilson) She really that good looking?
How many lives have been lost because of pretty girls?
She's getting uglier by the second.
We can try and pretend we're above it. We can try and intellectualize it away, but ultimately, shiny, pretty, perky things are good, and ugly, misshapen teenaged boys are repulsive.
Oh. Well, then, I guess my answer wasn't very helpful, was it?
Mini-stud. Stand up.
I spoke to your other partner.
No, I stayed away. Did it all over the phone. I asked for a reference, said you were applying for a plastic surgery job.
Yeah. (beat) He went nuts. Apparently you signed a non-compete. Now why would you agree to that?
You sign a contract because someone's making you, someone's getting something from you. (coldly) What did they give you in return?
So, you gave up your chosen career, just so they'd be quiet.
You risked this job. With nothing to fall back on.
Sit back down.
(reprovingly) Ask the Mormon. (explaining) I'm keeping him because he's interesting. (briskly) Dr. Terzi, would you please stand up?
Nice. [House frankly admires her.]I have treated you unfairly. [House walks over to her.] Prejudged you. And for me to be a better person, I have to rectify that situation. (bluntly) You're fired.
You... wanna grab some dinner?
Maybe a movie? Seriously.
(ONSCREEN) I care about your son.
(ONSCREEN) See, I became a doctor because of the movie 'Patch Adams'.
The horror.
Not so much sent... as stolen.
(ONSCREEN) ...You're putting your trust in somebody who DOES think the surgery's important.
God!
I was saying that was a STUPID thing to do.
Oh, stop it! Suddenly, I don't feel I can trust Michael Moore movies.
I owe it to the world to make sure this EVIL never sees the light of day.
Aww. [Gets off the scooter.] Five eager doctors and no sick people. Let us try and fill our spare time with a new challenge. The winner gets immunity...
The girl's fine. He didn't really cut her in half.
A drowning man's heart stopped, that is a mystery. Along with immunity, the winner gets to nominate two...
You have to leave work at 6:00 pm, but you make time for man dates?
No, I'm just hurt. When I asked you to come see Mamma Mia...
He's lying.
About everything. He's a magician, that's what they do. He screwed up the trick, he started drowning and he got a cardiac arrest.
The winner nominates two of your competitors. I will fire one of them.
Fine. Go run your tests. If you're wrong, you're fired.
If I say no, are you going to let your patient die?
We can all applaud the doctor who's willing to break all the rules. But the real hero is the unsung doctor, toiling in anonymity, because he broke the rules without getting caught. I need to know you have these skills. I need you... To bring me the thong of Lisa Cuddy. [Foreman looks up from his paper, the numbers all give House a weird look.] Not kidding. [They still all just sit there.] Thong. Cuddy. Go. [They get up and slowly start to leave, stopping before they pass Foreman.]
These are not Cuddy's panties.
No. Also, she's wearing a red bra today. [Everyone looks at him.] Like I'm the only one who noticed. Means the downstairs will match.
[To Amber.] Hike up your skirt.
Hike it down then. You're wearing a black bra. Let's see the underwear.
You two cut a deal.
Foreman. She's not wearing any underwear. You used to be more fun.
Let me see the MRI film.
Define soon.
You guys ever wonder how he was going to get out of that water tank? You. [Points to Kutner.] Come. [They leave.]
Ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing in my hands, nothing up my sleeve. I do have something in my pants, but it's not going to help with this particular trick. Watch closely. [Sticks his hands into Finn. Looks at the surgeon.] How you been?
[Nods, and continues feeling around inside Finn. Pulls out a small key.] Ta-da. [Shows it to Kutner.] Now you... disappear. [Kutner leaves.]
Look familiar? The MRI's magnet ripped this through your intestine into your spleen.
He's no longer on your case, because there's nothing wrong with you.
Everything that's happened can be explained by you being forgetful and incompetent. You screwed up, you passed out...
Your life doesn't hang in the balance. You know your life doesn't hang in the balance. Your reputation might hang...
I outgrew it. You?
Too much trouble. Can I just pick my nose?
[Takes a card.] If I tell you how it's done, will you go home? [Looks at his card, 6 of spades. Puts it back in the deck.] So you going to make it magically appear in my wallet? [Finn throws the cards at the glass wall. The Jack of hearts sticks there.] You are a hack. [House pulls the jack off the window to reveal the 6 of spades on the other side of the glass. House is surprised, he looks at Finn, then back at the card and rubs the window just to make sure it is on the other side.]
A nosebleed that major means he's actually sick. Means the cardiac arrest was a symptom. [Looks at Kutner.] Stop gloating.
Then what's that smirk?
I declare it officially on hold.
[To Cole.] Pull down your pants.
No, I want to give you a reward. Yes, I think you're lying. Cardiac arrest plus nose bleed, Go.
You, [Taub] take the gloater to the patient's drug den. Make sure you pat down his pockets before you leave. You [Amber] and Big Love, biopsy a blood vessel from around the heart, test for polyarteritis nodosa. You... [13] In my office.
I know. Hypothetical. A young woman does something clumsy in public, and instead of laughing it off, she gets irrationally upset. Explain.
But this girl's not insecure. Seems more like she's afraid.
I think you're hiding a medical condition.
Doctors often try to ignore their symptoms because they think they can't get sick. If you've got something going on, I need you to take care of it.
It's not compassion. It's self interest, I want my team healthy.
Okay.
How'd you do the trick?
What do you mean the actual magic? Think you're actually sawing women in half?
[Connects the IV up.] Magic is cool. Actual magic is oxymoronic. Might not even be oxy.
You got a nurse to plant the card.
You got a buddy to plant the card.
[Grabs some scissors and cuts the IV line, Finn is shocked.] The fun... [House opens his hand to reveal it was just a trick.] Is in knowing.
How bad? Is it new?
You eat a lot of beets, you have an electric toothbrush, and you sleep less than six hours a night.
The red betamine from the beets stains the plaque deposits on your teeth, which are then swirled by your spinning toothbrush. Your heavy lids and your prematurely aging skin tell me that you're carrying a major sleep debt.
It was meaningless until I explained it.
If the wonder's gone when the truth is known, there never was any wonder. You have tularaemia from your rabbits. I've put you on antibiotics, you'll be better in a couple of days. Sorry to spoil the mystery. [Leaves.]
Thank you. [Pops a pill.]
[Eyes boggle.] Oh. My. God. [Cuddy looks at him.] You're not wearing underwear.
Skirt that tight, you've got no secrets. Skirt that tight, I can tell if you've got an IUD. You seen Dr. Cole?
You're blushing.
Look at me. [Cuddy looks up at him for a second, House looks into her eyes as he grabs the pills. His eyes boggle again.] Oh! [Cuddy leaves.] My! God!
How'd you do it?
In this job, yeah. [Cole smiles.] Crotch, on the other hand... How'd you do it?
Just tell me, does Cuddy have her groove back?
You handed over her panties. I don't think gallantry's really an option at this point.
Excuse me, we were talking.
Why would you accuse the man who decides your fate of screwing up?
Cole has travelled through the forest of crustaceans and brought us a treasure, and he has earned his reward.
No, Sophie, you can't. Use whatever criteria you want.
So cardiac arrest and DIC, what's the common denominator?
Good. Go find out where he's hiding his cancer.
Would have been more impressive if he'd predicted that he wasn't going to die. Of course, that takes longer to prove.
If you're going to kiss his ass to protect your ass, at least wait until he's had a good idea. It's a symptom of him being a charlatan. He's a second-rate magician with a mysterious illness, why wouldn't he predict his own death? If he's wrong, we all forget it, if he's right, he goes out a legend.
I predict all your pagers go off... right now. [Nothing happens.] Oh! But if it had happened...
Are you acting stupid because you know you're safe? Clever.
He say anything about his hands or feet feeling weak?
No! Do not give me credit for that. Close doesn't count! That's how people get sucked into this stupidity.
Somebody stabilise him. [Kutner runs off, Cole follows.] The rest of you, pull his medical records, go back ten years. Look for joint pain, fatigue, anything associated with amyloidosis. [They leave.]
I noticed a trend... If nobody does anything, sick people often get sicker. You think it's remotely possible they had sex?
She barely knows him.
There was no woo. This was an effective test. [House scores.]
Kidney failure means I was right about amyloidosis.
Bad blood doesn't explain the heart or the liver.
Is cardiac arrest no longer considered a major symptom?
So your new theory is that you were an idiot to take this case.
Waste of time. He needs a bone marrow transplant for the amyloidosis.
Go prove I'm right. Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.
You've got two hours.
No, if I'd said that you got three lunar months, that'd be completely arbitrary. Two hours is how long it's going to take Big Love to finish a biopsy that you guys can't do because you're wasting two hours checking blood. [13 and Kutner leave. House turns his attention back to Wilson and the foosball.] Nine – Three.
Time flies, what have you found?
Inconclusive. Fat doesn't always give you the answer. Need to biopsy his actual organs, lungs, kidneys, liver.
Unless we start treatment for amyloidosis.
Show me evidence of infection.
He'll be dead in a day.
No! He'll be half a day off. Would it make you guys feel any better if I let you argue with me for... [Looks at his watch.] Three minutes before I order you to treat for amyloidosis? No. Just treat for amyloidosis. [Starts to leave.]
You're playing the Cuddy card?
Amyloidosis was your idea.
Yeah, me too, you were never fun. Give me the blood. I'm type AB, give me the blood. [Takes off his jacket.]
In where? How much tainted blood do you think they keep in here? How many people would have gotten sick...
[Rolls up his sleeve.] Ok. So transfuse blood from those donors. I'll be fine, we move on, treat for amyloidosis. [Holds out his arms.] Fill 'er up.
I have a new theory. You're not stubborn. You're not getting it checked 'cause you already know the answer. I found an old picture in your wallet.
I wasn't snooping, I needed lunch money. Figure it's your mum, except she looks about 32 years old. The only reason not to update a photo in 20-odd years is she's not talking to you, which would be interesting, or she's dead. Which would also be interesting. [13 gives House a look.] She's dead.
Pretty young to have a dead mum. You were even younger 20 years ago. I googled her obituary. Said she died at Newhaven Presbyterian after a long illness. Parkinson's?
I'm sorry.
No you're not.
Huntington's isn't the only thing that causes tremors.
I think you're the only one on the team who drinks decaf. I've been switching it out with regular ever since you dropped that file. You're trembling because you're hopped up on caffeine. The first file wasn't my fault. Medical explanation for that is... People drop things.
You are.
With Huntington's, it's inevitable.
[Surprised.] How could you not get tested? If your mum had it, it's a 50% chance, you're a bomb waiting to explode.
Yeah because if you knew, you couldn't do any of those things. [13 notices something.] What?
It's not pneumococcus.
I'm not the patient. The patient is the one whose body is shutting down, I'm having a benign transfusion reaction.
You first.
You are not biopsying me.
[Sighs.] The more transfusions you have, the greater the chance of you reacting, I've had three in a decade. Fever will be gone in a couple of hours.
I am not sick.
But not of what the patient has! My kidneys are working, I'm not bleeding out of every organ.
This is a waste of time. And it's distracting you from the actual case. [Gets up and starts to walk away but stops after a couple of steps.]
The room is spinning.
No, I'm dizzy, and my mouth just went dry.
It's a symptom of narcotics. [Looks at his cup of tea.] Who spiked my... [Collapses on the floor.]
Patient dead yet?
[Look at his hands and sees that he has been tied to the table.] That's a little much for a first date.
Feels like you already got the... lung and kidney samples.
Hey, you might want to use a little bit of lidocaine...
You drugged me.
Because there's nothing wrong with me. Did Foreman finally okay the amyloidosis treatment?
You can't be sure that I couldn't be sure.
Inconclusive.
I usually like to give the lethal blood to Foreman, but I'm the only one who's type AB.
Of course, you're type O. Universal donor. No wonder you're paying three alimonies.
[Shrugs.] I don't. Just seemed to fit the metaphor.
I didn't. You must have told me what you were.
[Epiphany.] There's no reason to ask anyone their blood type.
Nurse, can I have a moment with my patient?
It's too late. He's dying.
I'm sorry I doubted you. Be a shame if your secrets died with you. Perhaps you've got that trick written down somewhere? Or maybe you want to tell me, and I'll write it down for you. That way... you can live on.
You were wrong about everything. It was never magic, and you're not dying. [Finn is surprised.] What's your blood type?
Trust me, it's way cooler to know.
Up my sleeve. It's not amyloidosis. And his blood's fine, we just gave him the wrong type. Caused the DIC, explains the bleeding, multisystem failures.
That's because we don't test blood for type. We test for antibodies.
Apparently, he has one more symptom, his body's making an extra antibody, type B. Combine that with his natural type A, and presto change-o, he magically pulls blood type AB out of his hat.
God yes!
It's happened, and apparently, it's happened again. I finally have a case of lupus. Flush him with saline, transfuse four units type A, start him on steroids. He'll be back hoodwinking idiots in no time.
Big Love, rise. [Cole stands up, House gets down on one knee in front of Cole and lifts the pillow above his head.] Use their power wisely, my lord.
Cut-throat bitch, rise. [Amber stands up and gives a glare to Cole.] You're surprised? You're everyone's pick. [To Cole.] Next victim.
Now everyone's surprised. [To Cole.] Why?
No... I said you could use whatever criteria you want, doesn't mean I don't want to know. He was right about this being a real case, he was right about the botched transfusion and he's your love nugget. You've got no reason to pick him. [Cole hangs his head and stares at the ground.] But somebody else does. Kutner's a liability. He electrocuted himself, lit a patient on fire, it's only a matter of time before he burns the hospital down. You made a deal with Cuddy. That's how you got her underwear. She sold it to you for the right to put her choices on the block.
Your scheme was brilliant... and you're fired.
Her rules, not mine. The whole point of this was to subvert Cuddy. You became her partner, gave her power she didn't already have. Let her greedy fingers into my cookie jar, which, sadly is, not as dirty as it sounds. Thanks for playing.
[Picks it up and looks at it.] Looks like an envelope with the results of the genetic test for Huntington's inside.
I thought it'd be fun to find out together.
No, you're afraid to know.
I don't have to know the lottery numbers, but if someone offered them to me, I'd take them.
[slightly amused tone] My ears are burning.
Well if I lie, that would be little reassurance. [glances up and starts tearing down the streamers with his cane.] Dr. Kutner, who told you that it would be a good idea to put up superficial representations of a hypocritical season celebrating a mythical figure?
He lied. [tosses a Santa plushie into the trashcan] Homie knows better, Hymie doesn’t care, and Huntington’s would have done a better job.
That you know of.
[cuts Foreman off and trashes more streamers] Because I got sued when I called you “honeybuns”.
I liked you better fifteen seconds ago when you were afraid for your job. [more tearing down of streamers by the coffee bar] So who’s sick?
She says there’s no history.
Okay, this is gonna be a tough case. I have almost no knowledge of alien physiology.
Actually there isn’t. That’s kinda what makes it a rule.
[patronizingly] Oh… I didn’t know she’d promised. [Thirteen isn’t amused]
She lied about it.
She lied to the world. Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people that —
MRI what’s left of her chest. Set the machine to scan for irony. [sets his cup down, pausing] I’m going to go redo the patient history.
You mom tell you about all the drugs she does?
What about you?
[sarcastically] Are you a doctor?
That’s not an answer. It’s an evasion. [looks at his lollipop for a second] Are you drinking? You ever sneak a drink?
I understand why you don’t want your mom to know, but I’m her doctor so —
Why?
[won’t give up yet] What’s her favorite way to have sex?
[rolls his eyes] Are you a doctor? Did you go to med school since the last time I asked?
[cuts her off] White lies?
Those are lies we tell to make other people feel better.
Rationalizations?
Those are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better.
[cuts her off again] Lies of omission? [Jane looks unsure] Saddle bronc or doggie? That’s sex talk.
It’s child abuse.
There’s a reason that everybody lies. It works. It what allows society to function, it’s what separates man from beast.
You wanna know every place your mom’s thumb has been?
Lies are a tool, they can be used either for good… No wait, I got a better one. Lies are like children. Hard work, but they’re worth it. Because the future depends on them.
[interrupts] You lie to them! You pretend that their constant ponderous musing are interesting. You tell them they’re not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out.
We need a new theory.
Not yet.
Wouldn’t you not talking have made this a shorter conversation? Kid says mom’s a slut.
No, I called her mom a slut. Jumps anything with a pole and a pulse. Not that I’m judging here. Given her medical history, I’m actually impressed.
STDs aren’t the only risk in risky sex. Problem in sleeping with strangers is… they’re strange.
Send Foreman and Taub. They’re better liars, more likely to get to the truth.
[feels her glands under her throat but then is distracted by the necklace she’s wearing] Saint Nicholas?
Also seamen, merchants, archers, prostitutes, and prisoners.
[shrugs] Or just a credit hog.
Open wide. [shines a flashlight into her mouth] Say “aah”.
Only for the next 24 hours as long as you take the antibiotics.
Take a personal day.
[looks at her with a mock serious expression] I’ll write your pimp a note.
You’re tested for AIDS every three months and… your necklace.
I think they just like kneeling. [smiles] You don’t have the skin of a seaman, the fingers of an archer, the clothes of a merchant, or the attitude of an ex-con. So, just leaves one left.
Then you owe me half a lapdance.
Got the memo last year. I want to hire forty more fellows.
They work better when they’re scared.
He have any symptoms?
See? Clear, simple statement of facts describing their cooperation, with absolutely no attitude or fear. [reaches to grab another patient’s file]
Oh yeah.
Well that never hurt anybody.
[looks at one of the slips of paper in his hands, frowning] Do you spell “homie” with a Y?
I want to be respectful.
Not just you guys. [turns around to grab a Christmas stocking and puts the slips of paper inside, shaking it up to mix them] I like presents too. [offers the stocking up to Taub] Pick a name.
See, this is why no one likes your people.
The notion of picking one time of the year to be decent to other people is obscene, because it’s actually validating the notion of being miserable wretches the rest of the year.
On the other hand, you are now a team. Gotta work together and the simple fact is, giving people crap makes people like people so spend 25 bucks. Learn to love…
Interesting.
[cuts her off] Indicates nothing. I was referring to his reaction to the name he got.
Means… there’s someone here who wouldn’t be fun to buy for. [purposeful pause as he stares at Kutner] I wonder who. [offers up the stocking to Thirteen next] Pick a name, then go check out the patient’s house.
[smiles slowly] Interesting…
No family history of Kearns. Go to their house —
You’re absolutely right. Go to their house —
Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS. And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.
Oh! And whoever goes to their house… get me their computers.
You talk to your kid about sex so she’ll think you’re being open about everything. Keeps her from asking questions about the things you don’t want to talk about. [goes to grab the last name from the stocking for himself]
[looks at the slip of paper] Yes! Exactly who I wanted. This is going to be fun.
I want to drive them apart.
Conflict’s built right into the name. Santa’s about sharing, secret’s about withholding. [scores a goal and continues on playing by himself]
[interrupts] What did you get your wife for your final anniversary?
She hated it.
Then you didn’t buy it. [scores another goal, for the other team]
[stops and turns to look at Wilson, obviously not impressed] Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly how little we know about a person and nothing pisses off a person more than being shoved in the wrong pigeon hole.
[frowns at the computer, still having no luck] Someone get their birthdays out of the file.
[rifling through files on the computer] So she says. Find anything on the MRI?
[with more emphasis this time] So she says.
[musingly] Lacks personal boundaries… Promiscuous… Inappropriate obsession with truth-telling… Certainly sounds like a psych case.
Nope.
Her mind is tricking her body. We need to trick her mind. Or even better.
I know.
You have a genetic defect, you choose to ignore it. This woman has a genetic defect, chooses to butcher herself to be safe. Yet what you claim to be fascinated by, is her honesty. Interesting.
Hey, I gave you credit for interesting.
You’re protecting her because you’re jealous she did what you couldn’t.
I need you.
Fine, keep your mouth shut. I still need you. If it doesn’t work, you gotta hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to mom.
That does actually serve a medical purpose.
Jane.
If you show doubt, the placebo treatment won’t work.
[nods] A lot of great medications.
Because we might be wrong. And those medications take a long time to work and since your mom’s condition is declining, there’s a chance the drugs won’t tell us anything until it’s too late.
Maybe she’s hiding it from you.
Just doing what every good mom does. Protecting her child from bad news that she can’t do anything about.
You don’t know how to lie. You don’t know how to tell when you’re being lied to.
I know —
Mm-hmm. Figured I could sow some dissension and get a few ties and sweaters.
It’s Secret Santa.
[shrugs] They’ll argue about what to do with that information. Ties are less important than the dissension.
[head in his hand, looking disappointed] Well, that sucks.
4300 saved emails and not a single mention of “lesbionic”, “sanchez” or “man-gina”.
Swollen lymph nodes means it wasn’t psychological.
[glances to the present] Santa, obviously. ‘Cause you know I worship him. [pauses and frowns] No wait, I mean Satan. I always get them confused. [continues to read through emails] What is… an alpine butterfly? And why is she learning how to do one?
[interrupts] It’s just a climbing knot.
I did once. [sarcastically] And she just tied me down and whined about how hard it is to be Dean of Medicine.
[still staring at the screen, then laughs in a mocking way] That’s funny… Friend sent her a Garfield cartoon. That cat sure does love lasagna.
[pausing for a moment] If it weren’t for my obsessions, you wouldn’t know that she has sarcoidosis.
Eighteen months ago, she sold her Stairmaster. It was only two months old. Now either she needed the cash or climbing stairs was getting more difficult. [takes a sip out of his cup and continues to scroll through the emails to show them] Twelve months ago, she cancelled a hiking trip. Now she either just wanted to sit home and watch TV or walking was getting more difficult. She’s been suffering joint pain for the last two years.
Pull my ribbon. [mockingly seductive] If you know what I mean.
That’s not what I meant. [proceeds to open the present] Could just be an inactive phase.
I remembered. I’m not a Satanist, I’m a druid.
Yet.
[makes a sad face] That’s a shame. I’m not gonna surprise her with one for Christmas.
Wow!
[grins] Now either that cost more than 25 bucks or I’m seriously starting to doubt Steve Jobs’ business strategies.
Thanks!
[pleased] They’re arguing right now.
Did you look in the box on my desk? Oh by the way, your mom called. Your dad’s dead.
It wouldn’t have been as effective sitting in my closet in my home.
No, they’re gonna guess that it was from me. Might even be 90% sure that it was from me but all that means is, they’re 10% sure that one of the other guys is screwing them over.
[gets up to follow him] I couldn’t do that.
Yeah. That’s more where my powers lie.
[looks genuinely concerned] Have her platelets dropped?
[frowns at them mockingly] Listing all the possible causes is only impressive if you can do it reverse alphabetically. We need to know why her platelet machine is broken. Go to the factory. Do a bone marrow aspiration.
[lowers his voice] Well you’re not supposed to tell.
Or… somebody else wants to make me happy.
On one hand, you should be in bed. [shuts the door] On the other hand, I told you to rest so… I see your dilemma.
[in a singsong-y voice] Clap on.
[wants to say yes but then shuts his mouth] I’m saving my money for a Red Ryder BB-gun.
Darker shade of lipstick?
[leans closer to inspect her lips presumably] You tell your mother what you do?
Doesn’t matter. I’m curious.
[touches a finger to her lips and feels them] You do a donkey show? [a purposeful pause] I’m not curious. It matters.
Wow… That is a creepy smile. [cringes lightly] I bet the donkey’s is even creepier.
Nope. It’s my job. Contagious ecthyma. Any contact can cause rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat. Has there been… contact? [cringing again]
[starts writing her prescription] Okay. Antibiotic cream for you and a love glove for Francis. You’ll both be fine.
Sorry, I hate Westerns.
[interrupts them] Hey, hey. It’s Christmas! Why are you guys fighting?
Good for an aspiring superhero. Fatal for a human hoping to make it to Kwanzaa.
It has free will. It doesn’t have to be anything doesn’t want to be.
[to Kutner] You’re right, it’s gotta be. Go run her blood and hope that your sunny optimism isn’t misplaced.
They accused Kutner of screwing up a test. Because they hate him.
Well one day he will screw up a test. If they don’t accuse him of that because they like him, someone could die. [a pause] Where are we going?
[interrupts] Why is a 49 year old Cleveland man a closer match than her daughter?
[frowns and stop playing with his watch] Why not?
You’re wrong about sainted mommy.
[purposefully articulate] Yes. Yes, it is.
[gaze lingers on her for a moment and then drops Taub’s present back onto his desk as well] I will. And nobody leaves here until we find out what killed her.
Sure you can.
What you have, is one last Christmas with your daughter. One last chance to give her a present. [a purposeful pause] The truth. Inexpensive, highly valued, never have to stand in line to return it the day after Christmas.
A mother who’s going to die doesn’t refuse a donor test because it might hurt. She refuses when she knows it won’t match. Which tends to happen when mother and daughter aren’t mother and daughter.
I could do DNA tests, if you’d rather keep lying to me.
A promise to an addict is worth more than a promise to your daughter?
Right. [shrugs] She lives a lie, you get to die a hypocrite.
Yeah.
I got a watch, a vintage LP, and a second edition Conan Doyle. If that wasn’t bad enough, my patient’s dying.
I saw something amazing.
Pure truth. She told her mother that she was dying. Stripped her of all hope.
It’s like watching some… bizarre astronomical event that you know you’re never going to see again.
Because I don’t care. She cared. She did it anyway. [frowns for a second] She did it because she cared.
Oh, don’t ruin it. Don’t pin this on Christ, he’s got enough nails in him. [scowls at Wilson’s reindeer hat]
[cuts him off] Why don’t you take off that hat?
It’s a moose, on a Jew.
[sighs] Things have their place. You wouldn’t hang dreidels from a Christmas tree.
No. They don’t. [turns and goes back into the hospital]
[enters] To save us all from Satan’s power, when we were gone astray. Have you people no holiday spirit? Bring me the eggnog of good cheer!
[stares at him] Scrooge. Give the patient rispiradone.
I am going to perform a Christmas miracle.
Except for the one we discounted early, because it was impossible. When fetus forms, it’s just a mass of cells. [continues feeling her body, working down her shoulders] Breast tissue covers extensive portions of the body. As the fetus develops, most of this tissue recedes, remaining only in the fun places. [feeling down at her hip now] But sometimes, extra breast tissue is left behind in places where it doesn’t belong. [down to her legs now] Rispiradone does a lot of things. One is, it makes breast tissue swell so we can find it more easily.
Taub’s parents have a winter condo in Florida. They’re still New Yorkers.
[interrupts] Don’t care. I told a parable. And now, I’m going to raise the dead…
[to Thirteen] Give me that syringe.
Yes, I could be wrong. If I am, she’s dead so shut up.
Rispiradone also causes galactorrhea. [pulls the needle out]
Open your mouth.
Relax, you’ve had it before.
We’ll cut out your mom’s tumor and start her on chemo. All the rest of your symptoms should go away.
Have a wonderful life. [exits]
Patient's a crazy person?
[Still fiddling with the TV] There's something wrong with coma guy's cable.
Slippery slope. Today we withhold porn, tomorrow it's clean bandages.
After you talk to Carlson, maybe I'll...
Well that wouldn't be any fun. And for the next two months, winds make it impossible to fly anything in or out.
That wouldn't be any fun. If it's appendicitis down there, her appendix ruptures, she dies, there's nothing we can do. If it's stones, she takes pain meds, the stone passes, there's nothing we need to do.
Excessive Antarctic drilling. Bad for the environment and the ladies.
This is where it gets fun. [Dumps a box of stuff on the table.] These are the supplies and medications she has available.
I just said...
Who doesn't? That reminds me. [Leaves.]
Coma guy needs cable. Women's billiards is the only thing that's keeping him alive.
Carlson won't listen to me since I hit on his wife.
God no. I thought I was hitting on his daughter. [Cameron rolls her eyes.] Look, you're on the committee. He'll listen to you. [Cameron looks surprised.] I'm an avid reader of committees with hotties message boards.
[Following her.] Studies conducted in major hospitals indicate that happy patients recover faster. Studies conducted in my apartment show that TV makes people happy. Premium channels have a particularly striking effect.
Until this injustice is righted, I am going to waste 13 grand a day. [Tips out a box of tongue depressors onto the floor. Cameron just looks at him.] It's 2 dollars 49 cents down.
[Pulls out rubber gloves one at a time from a box and throws them on the ground.] How much is 13 grand divided by 4 cents?
I'll be fine on Tuesdays. [Cameron pulls the curtain in front of him.]
How's it going, team MacGyver? [Sees the screen.] Oh, great. I can't get cable, but I can get the South Pole on hi-def.
Test? Did Ford test the Edsel? Did Coke test New Coke? Did Shakespeare test his final play, Snow Dogs?
Can she see me?
Think Jagger shows up for the sound check? [Cate walks away from the camera.] Okay. Roadies, off the stage. Go help Cameron in the ER.
ER is standing room only. Which means Cameron's bound to make a mistake. Find it so I can blackmail her. As far as you know, this is way more than just some silly battle over cable. [New fellows leave, Foreman sits down.]
You, you might want to just, dial it down a smidge.
Let me guess. You're as pure as the driven snow.
Struvite stones are possible in people who don't have sex. They're certainly possible in people who claim not to have...
You do realise that only one of us is a real doctor?
While we're waiting for that test to prove me right, start IV cefuroxime. Keep the infection in the stone from wiping out your kidneys.
She's a great psychiatrist. One session, I've got shrinkage.
Your chem 7 results show that your kidney function is declining. Sounds like a kidney stone to me.
You agreed that the chem 7 would decide if it was a struvite stone.
You're not taking the cefuroxime. She's right handed. Means she would've put the IV in her left arm. Catheter in the arm makes it hard to bend the elbow the way people do when they drink!
Last I checked, you had a limited supply of doctors.
Right, he called dibs.
You're breathing fast.
Lift up your chin. Show me your windpipe. [She does so, both Foreman and House move closer to the screen for a better look.]
Means her right lung is collapsing.
There's no time. Get a syringe and a needle.
Shut up and look. [Cate does as she's told.]
She needs to re-inflate that lung. [Cate finds a needle.] Okay, now pull out that plunger. I want you to stab yourself in your right side between the second and third rib in the midclavicular line. [Cate pulls out the plunger but hesitates.] By the time we get someone else there, you'll have suffocated. Just do it. [Cate stabs her chest. We see the lung expanding and hear air being released from the needle. Cate starts to breathe easier.] See all the good stuff that happens when you listen to me?
Right side pain, vomiting, and now a lung that gets traumatised without any trauma. Sounds odd, probably is odd.
No it's fine. I made sure we got the South Pole long distance plan. Your latest kidney function test shows...
The more you interrupt, the longer my grandstanding is going to take.
Since the patient and her doctor happen to be the same person. Your kidney function is still declining, means you have a kidney problem.
No, makes us both wrong. Not equally. You were at least six wronger.
They run a PPD before you shipped out?
And you're worried the tumour might overhear, realise we're on to it.
Only if you count the tumour.
Probably in your abdomen. But you don't have any advanced imaging equipment. You also don't have a surgeon to biopsy it, any stains to use on the slide, or an oncologist to analyse it. [Foreman gives him a look.] We're too far away to hold her hand.
Since the only imaging equipment you have is X-ray, let's start there. X-ray your entire body.
Good for you.
She's annoying. Refused to take the antibiotics because other people might need them.
I'm a complicated man. I loathe her for many reasons.
You talk a lot of smack about tranny hookers.
Lymphoma.
You can't analyse a biopsy without a stain.
Cause they don't have stains down there. We need a substitute.
Anything with a strong colour could work as a stain. Printer ink, food colouring, coffee.
Find a node closer to the surface, one she can biopsy.
That makes sense?
In a shockingly calm manner, after I'd just been jerking you around for 30 seconds without you complaining or analysing said jerking.
In a lavender shirt. You for some reason are happy.
Abnormal nodes can be felt before they can be seen on an X-ray. You're wearing that shirt for someone.
Have to. You and Foreman are going to be here looking for a stain. [House leaves.]
I can think of at least three reasons. One of them's medical.
You're not in the hospital. No reason for me to be.
You're not in my apartment. You're three quarters of a world away. I promise not to get fresh.
One of us has to.
It's got walls, a floor, and in some places, a roof.
It's my apartment, it's not my soul. [Cate just sits there. Picks up the laptop and points it towards the room.] Living room.
[Points it back towards himself.] Only if you count Jenna Jameson's autobiography as a gynaecological text.
I love to laugh. Moving on. [Moves the laptop again showing a glimpse of the half bottle of bourbon on the coffee table.]
You are so far off. It's bourbon. [Gives her a better look at the bottle. Then continues showing the apartment.]
Well, you're sick. You have 20 people down the hall and you've had exactly one visitor.
You don't like people. You hide on that ice cube so…
[Rolls his eyes.] How about if I just get naked and you shut up?
Great. You’ve got me all figured out. You going to try and fix me now?
How long does it take you to get naked?
I saw socks. That's not naked.
Use your right hand to palpate the nodes. Any node you can feel is one we can biopsy. Let's start with your breasts, move down to the ass, then...
Well, you could. But I'd never forgive myself if we found something before we got to your breasts.
Turn your head. Locate the SCM muscle.
They teach you that before or after the class on fondling your inner child? [House turns on some music.]
Just thought it might help you relax. Anything in the axillary nodes?
Slide your hand to your sternum, probe for nodes. Moving slowly downward. [Cate does as told.]
Sorry, can't hear you on account of your heavy breathing.
[Turns off the music.] Hold it. [Cate stops.] Your fingers didn't go quite as deep. Feel that node again.
Looks like you're doing a biopsy.
Come on, Cate. Let's get this over with.
Just trying to move things along, Bob. [Wilson un-mutes.]
You okay?
It's a valid medical question.
She's 9,000 miles away. [Elevator opens, they walk out towards the exit.] And while a certain part of me unfurled…
Thought you were following me.
Where are you going?
You never go out to lunch. Means there's a reason you're going out to lunch. I assume that reason is a human being.
Sandwiches can come here.
Yet she's not, which I find interesting.
Small world. [Follows.]
It's got two doors.
Why would you think that I'm…
Let's assume that's true. And it certainly sounds like it might be. What are you going to do?
Well done.
Put these up. [Hands them some fliers.]
[Putting up a flier.] I love a new puppy. My last one was delicious, very tender.
If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one.
Harm suggests permanent damage. Get her to screw up, then fix it. Oh, and this time, don't tell her what you're going to do before you do it. [Leaves.]
Bad news is you're 0 for 2 in the kidney department.
Of course. There's cable. And the freedom to work pant-free.
Wilson found signs of inflammation in your biopsy. That plus the two failing kidneys points to autoimmune disease. Probably SLE or vasculitis. Treatment for both is prednisone. Start with 100 milligrams...
Take the prednisone, you'll get better, that'll be your confirmation.
That was not a waste. We ruled out…
There a good chance he's going to die anyway, since there won't be a doctor there to help him.
Right, just tell her to head north until she runs into a hospital.
Yeah, you can have it back. I've already been through it. I like your ice on a sprain metaphor. Makes it seem like we're not killing her.
Without her mittens. Mom told me that was a bad idea. Especially that winter it was 70 below and I had dual kidney failure.
[Picks up a receipt off his desk.] $190 restaurant tab. That's dessert, probably booze. Means you lingered. Means it's at least the third date. Means… [Starts to leave.]
To talk to the people I pay to come up with medical ideas.
Before A.N.A. testing, people had autoimmune diseases. How did they know?
Before that.
When you shake the test tube, the paperclip will damage some of your blood cells. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system will gorge itself on the damaged cells. They'll get big and fat so you can see them under a microscope. [She puts the test tube down and picks up the oxygen mask.] How you doing?
Couple hours. Or you could stop being a hypocrite and take the prednisone now.
If your psych patients demanded lab results, you'd never make a diagnosis.
Everyone is miserable. You don't change that because people don't change.
Oh shut up. I get enough of this from Wilson.
Sorry about that. Call me when you get the results. [Turns off the camera.]
She has an autoimmune disease. Tell the psych department she's in denial.
We should be hearing from the South Pole in a few minutes.
Well there's nothing to be done. She screwed up. She's got no one to blame but herself. [Cuddy leaves.]
Cuddy wouldn't can her for one screw-up and if she did, she wouldn't come to me. And if she did, she wouldn't open with, "how's your patient." And if she did...
Timeless question. In this case, she conspired with your coworkers to teach me that some things are more important than cable. And I'm gonna have to teach them that they're wrong. Come on, South Pole really should be calling. [Motions for Foreman to give him money to pay for his food.]
You're basing that on a test done with a paperclip. Just take the prednisone.
There is one way. You can take this experimental drug called... pred-ni-sone! Your Kidneys start working...
[Scrunches his chip packet near the microphone.] I, I think Foreman may have just broken up there. What he actually said was there is no other test.
I rejected it because if you're frozen solid, it's hard to get the needles into your arms.
Eight minutes outside would kill a healthy person. And healthy people don't suck on oxygen masks. Healthy people can pee.
Just take the prednisone!
Oh I'm sure she's just fine. Cate? [To Foreman] Do you know if there's anyone down there who has a cell phone.
Means it's not autoimmune. Good thing she's in a coma, or we'd have to listen to her gloat.
To find the useful members of my team.
Happy? Because of you, I'm not going to be able to watch law and order in Korean.
Because I want to ask you about your girlfriend. I must know who she is or you'd have told me her name.
There's only about 12 people we both know. I can't remember five of their names, so we're down to... Cuddy… Your ex-wives...
Yes, if only she wasn't in a coma, we could get her to run a test to find out why she's in a coma. The results would likely be paradoxical. Can't be Cuddy, 'cause you're straight. Can't be…
Too complicated... Unless he's thirsty.
Let's say yeah.
These are your only questions? Not, is it safe? Or, is there another way? Or, are you out of your minds?
Wait a second. You're in love with her. That explains why you're so eager to get her naked, then have a drink. Cause most guys like to go the other way around.
Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg. [Leaves.]
You got Cameron fired.
No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.
Wrong.
That should be a hint as to what you're supposed to say.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Right. You should've said this two days ago. Do not play games with me. Number one, you're going to lose, you're just not ready. Number two, the game was to force you to stop playing games. I need you to stand up to me. Challenge me. I need you to stop worrying about getting fired. Go pay for my cable. [Starts to leave.]
I didn't mean on this. Seriously, I need cable.
Milk, milk, lemonade?
That's bad news.
We don't do anything. You're going to drill a hole in her skull. If she regains consciousness, it's increased intracranial pressure.
She'll die. But if it's the hypothalamus, she's dead anyway.
Nope, but it'll give us more time to figure out what's wrong.
You love her, right? You'd do anything to save her.
Listen, listen. I am not going to let you hurt her. Okay? Now please... This is her only chance.
Well, that was easy.
If it comes out the other side, you've gone too far.
Let the fluid drain. [Blood starts to come out of the hole in Cate's head. After a few seconds Cate starts to wake up.]
South Pole doc is out of her coma, and now we have a new symptom. Increased intracranial pressure.
That's the patient room. ICP plus kidney problems plus lung collapse equals?
But not clots. What causes blood clots?
PFO would've been discovered in her pre-South Pole physical exam.
She has zero risk factors. Forget fat, think clots.
You're standing up to me?
Just to clarify. You should do that when you're right. Sorry for the confusion. How could a clot…
That's a perfect fit... Except it's completely impossible! Fat emboli requires an unrepaired bone break. Between the x-ray and the exam, I've seen her entire… [Epiphany.] See, that's what I'm talking about. [Kutner bows.]
Take off her socks. [Sean moves to her feet.]
Your toe is broken.
Bits of bone marrow have been leaking into your blood stream. Those fat emboli have caused blockages in your kidney, lungs, and brain.
Cold numbs everything. Does a particularly great job on the extremities.
This one you will feel.
He drilled a hole in your skull after drinking your pee. I think he's up for this.
Now splint your toe. You'll be fine.
Don't thank me. He's the one who saved your life. [Cate looks at Sean. They smile and hug. During the hug Cate looks back towards House and smiles. House turns off the camera.] He likes her. [House leaves.]
Well, you didn't pick her up. Which means she's coming from work too. Which means you're comfortable enough to meet her.
I think I've got it narrowed down to three possibilities.
It's not one of your ex-wives.
They don't. They should, but they don't. I called them. Someone new, but someone I know.
Briefly. You ordering the wine before she got here…
You're demonstrating the illusion of manly confidence. Which means you haven't closed the deal yet.
Still?
Your theory is I cared, therefore I let her keep her socks on? If that's what love is, then I don't want to have anything to do with it.
If I'd made her take them off like I should've, I would've seen the toe and would've solved the case days ago.
[Shocked.] Cut throat bitch?
The place is a mess.
[Doesn't take them.] It's not my fault, I don't use nurses.
I know, that's why I'm here. [Goes and sits down.]
She's going to look everywhere except the place she wants me to be. [Puts his feet up and starts to read a magazine. Glances over at Jeff who is sitting on the end of his bed smiling.] [To Cameron.] Hey.
What's with the idiot?
No. [Cameron makes an 'of course' gesture and goes back to what she was doing.] [To Jeff.] Sir. Why do you have two lunches in front of you?
And you're happy with that?
Seriously? It's a very useful tool. [Gets up and walks over to him.] Complain, you make people miserable. They do what you want to make the misery go away.
[To Cameron.] Is he Canadian?
Is that a yes?
Happy. [Jeff smiles.] I've got to stop this before it spreads. [House whistles. Taub, Kutner, Thirteen and Cameron all look towards House.] You guys are done. [Taub, Kutner and Thirteen start walking over, Cameron looks annoyed.]
Could be a metabolic disorder, toxic exposure, carcinoma of the tongue metastasized to the brain, Epilepsy, MS…
Okay, you two are perfectly healthy. This guy wasn't pandering, he wasn't vanilla nice, he was nice without any aspiration for personal gain. I'm thinking genetic defect.
Three cavemen, see a stranger running towards them with a spear. One fights, one flees, one smiles and invites him over for fondue. That last guy didn't last long enough to procreate.
At least as long as his wife has known him, 11 years.
What are you saying? That evolution is wrong? [Scoffs.] Where do you think we are, 21st Century America?
Okay, maybe I'm biased, let's take a vote. Who thinks that niceness is not a symptom? [Everyone puts up their hand.] And who thinks that their vote counts? [House puts up his hand.] You two [Points to Foreman and Kutner] check out his home for toxins. Taub and Thirty-One...
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that either way was good with you. Taub and Thirteen, MRI for tumors and EEG for nerve damage. Test whatever comes out of him for everything else.
Again.
Again. [Washes the pill down with some beer.]
No, it wasn't. No, it isn't. I didn't invite you to be nice, I invited you because bowling isn't one of the two things guys do by themselves.
Other hand. [Bowls a gutter ball.]
Ah, the ontological proof of niceness. The existence of the word proves the existence of the concept. Look out for those minotaurs on your drive home.
I wish the best for them and their tragically deformed children. [Bowls his second shot but we don't see the result, House doesn’t look too pleased though]
Well as long as I give it my best shot, I can hold my head high.
That's amazing. Cameron only has one insufferable friend? [Chase bowls another strike. Turns around and House is gone.]
Joint custody.
Unless we have another love child?
He needs a mother figure. I'm not saying you're not entitled to spend time with him, I'm just saying I'm entitled too. [Amber looks at Wilson again.]
The man knows me.
It's actually a very touching moment. I'm proposing I get every other day and every other weekend.
Mondays and Wednesdays, and midnight.
Wilson? Make a ruling.
I'll let you sniff first.
Take my deal, or I move in. [Sits down.]
[To Cuddy.] You are King Solomon. If you want us to cut him in half, we're cool with that.
And covertly. [Cuddy looks at him.] But I suppose you didn't know about that.
That top makes you look like an Afghani prostitute... Would be an example of that.
It can wait. [To Cuddy,] I will sign, if you will give us a ruling.
I'd be happy to continue the mockery of this process. [Sign's the review.]
Yes. Wednesday nights are ladies' nights at Cheetah's.
Wow. It really could wait.
And you thought it wouldn't be.
Doesn't mean his calcium should be low.
LowER, not low.
Lower than yesterday. Yesterday might have been high, what's lower than high?
So what gives us elevated calcium, bad taste, and fainting?
Get the team. This is going to be fun. [House walks off.]
Hello, again. These people think you are not too nice.
For life as we know it to have evolved without an intelligent designer. I'm going to prove them wrong. Your wife... is very ugly.
I think I just did. You're either perfect or you're sick. In my experience sick is much more common.
Nice in the sense that your toaster is nice for making you breakfast. It's the only thing his wiring will let him do. [To Taub, Kutner and Thirteen.] He has William's syndrome. [Back to Deb.] Your husband is missing the genes that make him suspicious.
Relax, there's no cure. He's going to go right on tasting lemon meringue pie, fainting, and being a sap.
He has no other symptoms.
He's got the teeth, glasses.
He doesn't work in the physics department. Except when they spill a black hole on their carpet.
Yeah, he's more legolas than Keebler, but I bet you he can still crack off a batch of Pecan Sandies.
[To Jeff.] You love to karaoke, right?
Modest, another symptom...
Give us a warble. You know any Cher?
Not a moment too soon.
Why do people say that with such pleasure? It's very hurtful, you know?
It's the way he said it. He wasn't relieved, he was excited. [Very happily.] He was also wrong, and I say that with no sense of pleasure.
You. [Points at Kutner.] Have a friendly demeanor, but you sometimes get too involved. You relate well to your peers and patients and you complete tasks in a timely manner. [Grabs a piece of paper and puts it in front of Kutner.] Please sign.
I have to give each of you performance reviews. [Kutner looks at the paper, still a little shocked.] Plenty of other conditions can cause debilitating niceness.
I don't know. How's it supposed to help Wilson? [To Kutner.] Cross out Wilson's name and the date, and then fill in your own...
I'm thinking neurosyphilis. Wouldn't show up on the MRI without contrast. [Looks at Kutner.]
Because he doesn't know. That's why we do tests.
You want me to intimidate him into not being afraid? Not sure I know how to do that.
I don't think that the right time to tell the dog not to pee on the rug is semi-annually.
I am concerned about the rainforest.
I know. [Walks to his office.]
[Gets up to open the door.] You're 15 minutes late! [House opens the door and its some Guy in a suit standing there.]
[Looks confused.] Miley Cyrus is playing a third night at the spectrum?
Oh, you're selling religion. I'm sorry, I bought some Islam yesterday. [Lets Amber and Wilson in.]
You're late.
16 minutes, MY 16 minutes.
[To Wilson.] You hear that? She doesn't care.
It matters because you don't get to decide what matters.
[Rolls his eyes.] I had to take a dump. Anything else I don't need to know before you leave? [Opens the door.]
[Shuts the door and looks at Wilson.] Daddy needs a drink. [Walks off to get one, Wilson laughs.]
10:30.
I'll get you home before lights out. [Pushes the drink closer to Wilson who takes it.]
Really? You'd think that one or more of your ex wives would have mentioned that to me.
Because I'm your friend.
[Answers.] Hello, and thank you for saving me from being righteoused to death. [Gets up and walks away from Wilson.]
Don't put it on the board. [Taub stops writing.]
I think it's my marker. [Taub rubs what he had written off the board.] He has syph, and what?
Not everyone agrees.
If you all thought it was syph, you wouldn't have woken me up in the middle of the night.
Two more probablys than I like to hear.
Full night, actually. Guy might not make it to brunch. [House hangs up the phone and walks back over to Wilson.] Yes, I knew about your issue with alcohol. Yes, I intentionally got you drunk to provoke an argument between you and Amber. Why I would do such a thing is an interesting question. What's more interesting is that you knew as much as I did and you're the one who's pouring down the drinks. Why?
[Looks at them.] Yes?
I'm multi-tasking. Also doing my taxes. And Cuddy. What'd you find out?
I assume from your omission of the word 'viral' before the hep that it's not another STD. Put him on steroids and test him for sarcoid before the liver failure becomes liver failed.
There's more?
[Turns off the TV and turns to face them.] No, I don't.
Which one of you?
There's something I need to tell you.
On time.
On time. No tag backs.
So you didn't have sex?
Well you can have it tonight. The L Word is on.
If you terminate the agreement, it's not going to bring peace in the mideast.
Fine. Whoever violates it gets their finger cut off.
So am I. You want people to drive safer, take out the airbags and attach a machete pointing at their neck. No one will drive over three miles per hour.
We'll figure it out. On your time. [House opens the door. Amber sighs, kisses Wilson goodbye and leaves. House shuts the door again and turns back to Wilson.] You know she's certifiable right? I've got the forms in my desk.
Nothing.
I needed to tell you something... privately.
You'll tell her. She's your girlfriend, you should tell her.
It's not the same. [Opens the door and starts to leave.]
Where am I wrong? [Shuts the door behind himself.]
Critiquing the clap addled? That's sort of tasteless.
No, I don't.
Compared to those three?
I like Cuddy. I like parts of her.
I want to empower them. Those three idiots need to respect you. They should respect you, they should be afraid of you, so I have to humiliate you, because if the team fears you, they won't question you. If they don't question you, they won't get any answers, if they don't get any answers, they're useless.
The hospital will probably build you a statue one day. You know, with a 'kick me' sign on the back. So when you think about it, the more I mock you, the more it shows I have respect for you.
Wouldn't rule that out completely.
Almost done. [To Foreman.] Uh, so just remember, the rabbit goes around the tree and jumps down the hole. [Ties his shoelaces up.]
Run him for everything you can think of. Lepto, schisto, hemo, and the fourth Marx brother nobody ever heard of.
Or she scabbed. Depends on your point of view. So what do we think? New symptom? Or just a wife beater? [To Kutner] Hey, time for you to take this baby for a spin. [Throws the whiteboard marker to him, Kutner gets up looking pleased with himself. House takes his seat and moves it closer to Thirteen.]
Good news is, he's running out of organs to fail.
At that rate, by sundown, he'll have eaten most of us.
So... syphilis prevents domestic violence. I'm going to be even more attractive to the ladies.
Well, they're all good ideas. [Foreman raises an eyebrow.] Okay, let's take a vote. How many think it's the roids talking? [Taub sticks up his hand.] And who's for the penicillin? [Kutner] And how about whatever she said? [Thirteen. House looks at Foreman.] Someone hasn't raised their hand.
[Laughs.] Why would I do that?
The PFO's have it. [Everyone gives House a weird look.] I just hope the bubble test is positive or it's no more Mr. Nice Guy. [Everyone stares at House for a few more seconds before leaving.]
You know that thing I was going to tell you, I've got to tell you. I've got to tell someone. You have to swear not to tell CB.
Well, that's not swearing, that's shrugging. It's actually the opposite of swearing.
My team thinks that I have syphilis.
Not yet.
Because I knew that they had access to an old blood sample, and I knew they'd test it sometime for something.
[Rolls his eyes.] Shut up, you're missing the point. Now, they think that I'm on penicillin.
And as I get better, I get nicer.
Foreman thinks I actually value his opinion. [Wilson laughs more.] Thank god he said PFO, or I'd have had to do some dancing. You got time for bowling? [Wilson doesn't say anything.] Come on, it's work hours.
No.
Yeah, and you're going to keep talking about it. We are who we are.
Is this some sort of recap?
Oh! Uh... I know this.
I was going to say that.
Who?
Get that idiotic smile out of my face. I've got to go on a killing spree.
[Sighs.] It's not chagas.
Is two a spree, or do I have to kill you too? Chagas wouldn't explain the niceness.
The MRI showed no signs...
[Looks at it.] It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis? [Kutner shrugs.] Damn. That should have been my epiphany.
Good news, bad news. Good news is we know what you have, it's treatable, you're going to live. [Both Deb and Jeff smile.]
The cure is a grueling course of pills. It's like one a day for a month.
Yeah, like that's a challenge.
Well not quite. Your brain's been swollen, not enough to see but enough to alter your personality.
He screamed at you, you don't think he can change?
So you think drugs are more powerful than parasites? [Realises that's exactly what they are about to give him.] I mean... The ones we're going to give you to treat the parasites obviously are but... I stand by the principle.
[Shrugs.] Neither am I, but that's because I don't care.
It was brought to my attention that on occasion, I am not respectful of hospital hierarchy. [Sticks a lollypop in his mouth.]
Because, underneath it all, we are all the same. And Foreman refused to type his up.
There's an extra one in there.
Foreman convinced me that these can be helpful.
You'd think I'd have noticed. What exactly did they do around here? [House picks up the review and continues from where Cuddy left off.] You act like employees should fear and respect you, but your eyes tell us... [Looks up at Cuddy.] Actually your eyes tell us nothing because we're looking at your boobs. [Goes back to reading.] Which tell us that you're desperate to have someone jump on you and tell you they love you one grunted syllable at a time. What you want, you run away from. What you need, you don't have a clue. What you've accomplished makes you proud, but you're still miserable. [Hands it to her.] Please sign.
She breached confidentiality. You can let it slide, officer. We're even.
Roll over. [Patient rolls over with some help from Amber.]
Want to come over to the poopy side? Where are you two going Friday night?
[Stares at her.] You're lying.
[driving the car] An autographed picture would be nice. Oh… And I’m also gonna save your life.
That’s probably true, seeing as how you have a brain tumor.
Actually, I’m the nut-job head of diagnostic medicine.
Actually, I do mind. I don’t care if you die. But if Brock Sterling dies, Anna never finds out he’s the father of Marie’s baby.
[stands, echoing Evan] Help! We’re gonna need a wheelchair… here. [he ducks his head back into the car] Look, in the last month your average line reading has slowed from 2.1 seconds to 2.9. You’re pausing more. Always at the same intervals – every seven to nine words. Which means you’re having trouble reading one side of the teleprompter. Which means a peripheral vision problem. Which means a tumor in your occipital lobe. Just one test. If there’s nothing wrong, I’ll take you right back home.
[tossing the keys to a passing employee] Uh, just put it in my spot.
It tells me where your blind spots are. So… the twins They’re gonna turn out to be yours, aren’t they.
But you want to be done with this, right?
I knew it. [pumps his fist] Julio knocked her up before her appendix burst. You got her after.
‘Cause it’s awesome.
As opposed to shows that represent the world exactly the way it is, like… I can’t think of any.
Hospital is being inspected and Cuddy dispatched you to keep an eye on me. [pause] I just parked a town car in an ambulance bay and, instead of ripping me one, Cuddy acted like she didn’t know me. It’s either an inspection or an aneurysm.
As I suspected, you have significant losses in the upper right quadrant of your visual field.
No, it’s a joke. Two guys go into a bar and one has significant losses in the upper right quadrant of his visual field. And the other one says, ‘You’re gonna need an MRI to confirm the type and location of the tumor.’
No, it doesn’t.
I kidnapped you. You’re surprised that I lied to you? [Evan jumps out of the chair and grabs his jacket] It just means that the symptoms are intermittent.
It’s sweet that I haven’t lost the ability to surprise you.
Are you mocking me?
Don’t care. Busy.
Well that sucks. Don’t buy a new one. [He takes a syringe from a drawer, locks the cart, grabs his cane and turns to leave. Wilson follows]
She’s incapable of doing anything that matters without turning it into a zero-sum game.
Wow. I’m faster than you right now. [He uses his cane to push open an elevator door before it shuts. Evan is in the elevator. He turns away from House and pulls out his phone.] It’s all about her and whatever hapless salesman wanders into her sights. She’s gonna lie, steal and trade your testes to get whatever she wants. Hold on. I just gotta do something before he dials the second ‘1.’ [He uncaps the syringe and injects Evan in the back of the neck.] You’re going to end up humiliated, [Evan drops to the floor] holding her purse and going home to sleep on a new mattress you hate.
He needs an MRI.
Give me one millimeter slices from the cortex down.
[trying on Evan’s sunglasses] Guy has a history of violent outbursts during surgical procedures.
Increase the magnification on the occipital lobe. You watch because you like or because I like?
Bzzt. Sorry. That’s not an answer, that’s an apology. If we’re ever to come out of the darkness, we have to be proud –
He’s fine?
See if you can talk him out of suing me.
It gets a lot narrower when you add in peripheral vision problems.
But it doesn’t make sense to include the symptom that he caused in a differential he’s so desperate to solve.
Stick to the filing, sweetheart. Let the doctors do the doctoring. Either toxins or a vitamin deficiency –
Kutner, leave the room. Wait thirty minutes, come back and tell her the test was negative.
Get out of here.
They’re busy. Which is really annoying because I wanted to be able to say they’re busy for no other reason than to screw with you. [he picks a tape out of a plastic carton he just dropped on the table and shows it to her] Research.
You can’t tell me you didn’t notice that pause.
Ah, this is a whole new experience in super high def. I had no idea Marie wore an underwire.
Could be demylenation from toxic exposure.
Keep watching. You’ll never guess what Rico’s got in that box.
You want the star of the hottest daytime drama on TV to die in your hospital?
I can’t do my job if you’re going to tie my hands like that.
I want that TV.
You want something. Either you’re bargaining or you’re begging.
Yes, but it’s better for you. I just want us to be equally happy.
Or a toxin.
Or a toxin.
Might not be. We’ll know after I’m finished searching his set and dressing room for medically relevant stuff. Gotta go. Need a decision.
Yeah, that sounds like me. [to Kutner] Test for heavy metals, organics, biotoxins and search the home.
Pack your manhood on ice. Maybe the hospital can reattach it.
“You choose” does not mean you choose.
It’s a trap. It means “if you love me you’ll buy the one I want.” [He grabs a handful of shelled sunflower seeds from a large container, popping them into his mouth while continuing the conversation.]
People who do aggressive don’t like to limit themselves. Could a leaky space heater cause vision problems and numbness?
Did I hear a question mark at the end of that sentence?
Gotta go. [hangs up]
No. You’re not going to marry Brock, are you? We’ve been waiting four years for him to make it official with Anna.
Glioblastoma. Need more proof? So, no toxins on the set, how about his regular life? Unusual hobbies? Unsavory friends?
And by “out” you mean…?
Too small or too large?
I’m a doctor and it’s relevant to me. So, yes.
[thinks and looks at the seeds in his hand] Now that’d be interesting.
He’s impotent. [he takes a packet from his pocket and tosses it on the table] Steady diet of sunflower seeds causes a B6 toxicity, which causes an autonomic disregulation, which causes a wood-free existence.
It’s more than just one. He can’t even remember the last time he was able to salute. It’s cool, huh?
So all we have to do is filter the B6 out of his blood. Prep him for plasmapheresis.
[looks around] And can you find out where that voice keeps coming from? And tell it to get out of my head.
Confirmation is for wimps and altar boys. We don’t need to wait for a reflex. If he can’t get engorged the way God intended, he can’t get engorged.
Lack of response to your chest tells us nothing. Thirteen, show him… [exhales loudly] Where can I find a decent set of knockers around here?
In that case, it could be an atypical bunion.
You want to be here.
Just say the word. I’ll fire Thirteen.
Smart move. I was bluffing. She’s right. We should fry the thyroid before it fries him.
If that gland has drawn a bulls eye on his heart, then no.
[whispers] “We?” [aloud] Anyone else want to run a useless test while Brock’s thyroid plots its next lethal move? [Thirteen raises her hand. Kutner and Taub follow] It was rhetorical.
Seriously? I mean, I am, but you think so?
Just grabbing a snack.
Well, if I keep it in the lounge, everyone else eats it.
Oh. I thought it was just everyone else’s bags.
They’re not going to find out. Unless, of course, Conway planned on inspecting the morgue in, say… two minutes. [feigning ignorance] Is that why you’re here?
No. Over a TV. And you’re not gonna get fired because you’re gonna fold.
But you’re gonna push it. So we need a safe word. So you can signal your unconditional surrender. [Conway enters] Call me “Sweet Sauce.” [he smiles at Conway and shakes his hand] Dr. House. I don’t think we’ve met.
Most people have. It’s also a noun. [pause] I sometimes come down here to relax, unwind. Maybe grab a –
It’s a nickname.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. ‘Cause those sick, blind kids aren’t going to read to themselves. See ya. [Almost out the door, he turns back] I recommend skipping C-26. Floater. Been in the river at least a week.
Any time. [leaves]
Nope. They’ve got a 12 inch, exactly like the one that used to be in here.
I’ll be doing a dance of joy just as soon as my leg is healed. [to the maintenance men] Can you tilt that down?
I had to. In the name of science. I let the crap pile up and I see which team member is the most self-flagellating – breaks down, clears up the mess. Surprise was, it turned out to be you. Again. And you weren’t even registered as a competitor. You miss me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All pretty girls are fungible. You’re avoiding.
Seriously. I’ll fire Thirteen. Or Kutner, if you think Thirteen is hot.
I told you to nuke his thyroid.
So, your test screwed me and our patient’s kidneys. You practically poisoned him with iodine.
Must be the rancid tinge of betrayal that’s put me off.
[turning on him] So tell me to my face. You never hesitated before. The Board’s turned you into a coward.
You did it to pass an inspection.
You’re right. You and the team, go measure the ceilings.
Accreditation board guidelines state that no object can be less than 18 inches from the ceiling. Make sure we’re in compliance.
I don’t mean us. I mean the whole hospital.
You made it to page 8. Mysterious hospital visit for soap doc.
That’s what we’re here to find out.
Are you really as miserable as everyone seems to think you are?
Nothing matters. We’re all just cockroaches, wildebeests dying on the river bank. Nothing we do has any lasting meaning.
If you’re unhappy on the plane, jump out of it.
Mmm. That’s the problem with metaphors. They need interpretation. Jumping out of a plane is stupid.
That’s the other problem with metaphors. Yes, what if you’re actually on an ice cream truck and outside are candy and flowers and virgins. You’re on a plane! We’re all on planes. Life is dangerous and complicated and… it’s a long way down.
No, you’re afraid to change. You’d rather imagine that you can escape instead of actually try. ‘Cause if you fail, then you got nothing. So you’ll give up the chance of something real so you can hold onto hope. The thing is, hope is for sissies.'
Too many. Half the people I save don’t deserve a second chance.
You realize you’re reciting lines from last season?
Cooling blankets in here. This guy’s brain is about to boil. [he returns to the bedside. He snaps his fingers twice to get Evan’s attention] Do you know where you are? What’s your name?
Good news is the last time Brock was in a coma, he fathered two children.
Test him for fungi, parasites, all creatures great and small.
To lie down. I need to think.
Could be rat bite fever. But his glands aren’t swollen. Which one are you gonna get?
So get it. Listeria explains the sepsis, possibly also the heart problem.
If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis which then caused the numbness.
Wow.
I’m ignoring you because you make me sad. He’s on ampicillin. Which means if it’s listeria he would have shown some improvement.
Who cares? You wanted one your whole life. You’re a grown up. You can afford it. Stores sell them.
You don’t deserve to be happy.
It is stupid. [he puts down the pillow and starts to leave] Live the dream, Wilson.
It’s not an infection. It’s an allergy. That’s why it’s not responding to antibiotics.
Especially if we give them the wrong drugs. What’d the tests say?
The more infections we rule out, the more likely it is that it’s not an infection.
Allergens could trigger an allergic vasculitis. That would explain the symptoms.
But an infection is never resistant to every antibiotic.
And allergy never responds to antibiotics. Never beats rarely. QED I won. There were chrysanthemums in his dressing room.
Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrins, a neurotoxin and a know allergen.
He has an allergy. If we don’t give him steroids, we’ll kill him.
Fast enough. We don’t have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something. And what we’re doing right now isn’t working.
A hundred milligrams methylprednisilone.
It’s one patient.
Perfect. The patient’s in a ’69 Ford Coma.
I am 99% certain that she’ll consent. [he heads behind the counter] For the sake of the 1%, why don’t I just…
Well, tell the inspector he can put it on my tab.
We were wrong about the infection. He’s suffering from a severe allergic reaction.
In rare cases… Trust me. At the end of this conversation, I’m right.
What is it about this severe and deepening coma that makes you think we got time for protocol?
If you think I’m wrong, tell me I’m wrong. Don’t talk about protocol.
Okay. Here’s what you do. You wait three minutes, then you call security. By the time they get here and lock me up, I’ll be done. He gets to live and your ass gets to be covered.
To what?
I was wrong. [to Cuddy] You should have stopped me. [he leaves]
Don’t hang up. What was the verdict?
You should have been fired.
There are bubbles in his glass.
My patient is allergic to quinine. [Cuddy turns on the light and sits up.]
The symptoms started two months ago. It’s also when Brock started downing gin and tonics like a Brit staving off malaria. The gin was fake. The tonic was real.
You should’ve been fired.
I saved his life.
The contract clearly stated no takesy backsides.
What are you wearing.
Good night, Cuddy.
Uh...I don’t know.
[House sees a very short flashback of someone bleeding.] I don’t know how I got here. [Exhales into his hand and smells his breath.] How many drinks did I have?
That means I was drunk when I got here. [Looks at his watch.] 8:50. [Thinks.] I remember being at work. I’ve lost at least four hours. [To the dancer.] Say five words.
That’s four words. The accepted diagnostic test for global memory impairment is five random words.
I’m...[Dancer sits on his lap.] Trying to find that out. Give me five... Animals.
[Closes his eyes.] Monkey, Rhino... [Grabs his head.] Either I’m massively drunk – [Looks at blood on fingertips.]
Or it’s someone else’s blood. Do you see a wound? [Dancer winces as she looks at his scalp.] How bad is it?
I have a concussion. Retrograde amnesia. [Pats his pockets.] I have no keys, no phone. I’ve been mugged.
Did you earn it?
Someone is going to die.
Not you. I saw something, a symptom. Someone is going to die unless I find them.
I have no idea. Keep the change.
I saw somebody dying.
I saw a symptom before the crash.
Bad argument. Since I was right about that.
[Pulls away.] Ow!
Why was I taking the bus?
What if I saw someone and I followed them on from... Somewhere in Princeton?
Perfect. Uh...Uh...You. [Points to Taub.] Get histories from everyone in here.
No. [To Thirteen] Lesbian. Find out if anybody on that bus was taken to other hospitals.
No, Thirteen. I just wanted to call you a lesbian.
I was rounding up, from 50%. [To Kutner] Find my cane and motorcycle. Figure out where I went last night.
You’re going to trust me? I lie about everything. [The three of them leave.]
How much bigger could it get?
What if it’s not a coincidence?
That... Or the symptom caused the crash. [Looks around.] Did you see anybody in a bus driver’s uniform?
Right here. Purpura on Ralph Klamden’s neck, indicative of leukaemia. Caused a bleed in the brain, and hence the accident.
No, we just ruled that out, pay attention. [To Wilson] He probably had a seizure.
Which you drove into while you were seizing.
Hey! [House walks over to one of the crash victims being wheeled out in a wheelchair by a nurse.] Nobody leaves here until I say they can be discharged.
Is she me? [Feels his forehead.] You have a fever.
I need him to stay.
Stiff neck. [Yells to everyone in the ER.] This man has meningitis. We need to quarantine the whole ER. No one leaves here until their full workup is complete.
Well, that covers ten seconds out of the four hours I can’t remember. Where else did you look?
[Looking through the files.] It would be helpful if these came with head shots and resumes.
Both of which are expected complications when someone goes from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.
Okay, new plan. We make a list of all the bars between here and the crash site. Find out where I went, we go there –
You’re not going to do anything, are you?
Someone is dying because I can’t remember –
You’re not doing to make me do the chicken dance, are you?
[Lying back with his eyes closed.] So what, you saw an ad on the back of a comic book?
This is a waste of... [Suddenly House is on the bus, which is empty.] Time. [Looks around.] Cool. [Chase appears on the bus in front of him.]
The bus is empty. [House suddenly sees a hand waving in front of him. We are back in Houses office and we see that Wilson is waving his hand in House's face who is just staring straight ahead.]
[Looks around.] I can't see out the windows, and I can see you guys.
I need a reason? [Looks to his right and Wilson is sitting next to him.] God, I hate 'beer' brand beer.
I can be mistaken, but I can't actually lie under hypnosis. [Continues drinking.]
When I'm drinking without you? What am I running away from? Hmm, One of those imponderables. Can you hold off on your insecurities until we find this patient?
[Looks around sees some people playing pool, some just drinking, all of them have no faces.] I see a faceless crowd. How do I focus? Say something to make me focus. [Amber appears in the corner.]
[To Wilson] Will you get your girlfriend out of here?
You put her in my head. I can't even have a conversation with you in my subconscious without her tagging along.
[Sighs] Unfortunately. [Pause] I didn't mean to say that out loud.
I didn't say it out loud? Nothing.
[To Chase] If I can't lie, I need these two out of here.
I wish it were that – [Notices that Wilson and Amber have disappeared.] That's some program they got down there in Melbourne. [He picks up a fluted glass of what looks like champagne.] Cheers. [House looks up as he raises his glass and sees the bartender.] I remember the bartender.
He seems fine. [Looks around] Anybody here sick? Anyone here taking the bus?
[Looks at the bartender again.] Because... You took my keys.
[Back on the bus. He can see all the passengers.] Passengers.
Some emo guitar hero wannabe.
[Emo Guy picks his nose.] Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus. He's dying.
[To Emo Guy.] You a nose picker?
If the answer was no, you would have answered. Tilt your head back.
You have a brain tumour.
If I was kidding, I’d be dressed like you.
Go home. Have fun. Relax. I’m probably just a nut case. [Emo Guy looks at Cuddy.]
[Looks in Emo Guy’s nose, sees nothing of interest.] You can get your things and go.
Your legs are not your biggest problem. Your biggest problem is... I don’t know what your biggest problem is.
So, we have the who, but not the what.
We actually have two symptoms.
[Makes some weird arm movements, everyone looks at him.] I’m just trying to figure out what Guillain-Barré looks like.
How about because it doesn’t match what I could have seen? Guillain-Barré has no external physical manifestations.
To smell a bus, obviously. [Taub, Thirteen and Kutner follow him out. Foreman stays behind.]
Smell is the most powerful evokerater of memory. [Takes a couple of Vicodin.] I need to get back on that bus.
If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain helps focus the memory.
A hint of... Exploded bus. [Takes another couple of Vicodin.]
[Dumping all the clothes onto the table.] Wish me luck. I’m going in. Rambo style. [Slams his head down in the clothes.]
[Stands up again and now he's back on the bus.] Both, apparently.
So, you’re saying I’m not here. [Walking towards the bus driver.]
Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.
We’re both in my head. You’d think one of us would have noticed the blood.
Who do you want me to treat? Me or you? Did you have a seizure?
Dumb answer. I wasn’t asking you, I was asking me. Because you’ve already proven that you're not here.
Is that a clue?
You weren’t on the bus.
Five hundred dollar shoes. Not on a Princeton cross-town.
Yes. What do you have to tell me? [Wilson slaps his hand on House’s shoulder, bringing him back to the present. House is annoyed.] I was talking to the passengers on the bus!
If you haven’t found the bleed yet, it can’t be –
Very little.
I wanted to see her naked.
I want to see her naked.
[Laughs.] Well some guys get upset when you objectify their girlfriends. But if you’re okay, I’ve got a digital video camera. So we could –
Trust me. I want to do some very nasty, demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.
I banged my head.
I’ll rest once I’ve figured out what’s wrong with this guy.
I don’t know.
Recovery’s too fast.
Which means it’s not transverse myelitis.
Wouldn’t explain the paralysis. Addison’s, from a tumour. It’s possible that I saw his eyelids droop.
A little thing called a bus crash. It’s just a scalp laceration. It could be hidden in his optic chiasm.
[Ignores Foreman.] But that would have affected his eyesight. I need to take a bath.
Hypnosis gave me a nose picker. Smells set off hallucinations. Sensory deprivation should get the brain into an alpha-theta phase. [Hands the rest of the salt to Thirteen and then takes off his shirt.] Didn’t you see Altered States?
Well then you’re too young to be a doctor. That movie was released in 1980.
No, it wasn’t, shut up.
No. I just remembered how old I am. [Gets into the tank.] I need to give my brain time to transition so I can embrace my inner monkey. Or maybe I don’t. Give me some physostigmine. It crosses the blood-brain barrier.
Don’t do anything. Even if I escape. Eat a goat. Get shot by police –
I used to drive home after getting drunk, but some mothers got MAD-D. What are you doing here? You weren’t on the bus with me.
If it’s a fantasy, you’d be wearing... This. [Cuddy clothes suddenly change to a much skimpier outfit.]
Don’t blame me. Blame my gender.
Why can’t you do both?
[House smiles as he watches Cuddy.] From behind, I saw his earlobes wiggling. Or his head bobbing. [Cuddy takes off her top and drops it on House's face. House sits stunned for a few seconds and then takes it off his face, as Cuddy gives him a nice look at her ass.] But not that.
Marfan’s syndrome.
What if his earlobes were just drooping?
Or cutis laxa.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He’s an adult, very good point. Keep going. [She holds her bra up and turns around to House again who is leaning forward watching very closely.]
[Screams.] No! Dance, woman!
I screamed no.
Tell me what I saw.
That doesn’t make sense. Because your shirt wasn’t stained. And because that was me. [House’s ear starts bleeding.]
Huntington’s wouldn’t explain the abdominal pain. And it’s only on the table because we’re thinking of Thirteen.
Except there’s no such thing as shuffling sitting.
[Turns around and walks over to her.] Who are you?
At what?
[To Mystery Woman.] You were right. [Turns around and is suddenly blinded with light, which brings him back to the present as Foreman, Cuddy, Wilson, and Thirteen open the lid to the tank.]
[Jumps up.] I got it! It’s Parkinson’s.
Start him on levodopa.
Get that out of my face.
I don’t need your name. And I got your profession from your super competent technique of melting my retinas.
I remember puking on Cuddy’s shoes. [Turns his head.] Ow.
It’d hurt a lot less if you didn’t swipe my pain pills.
[Sees a security guard standing near the door.] Wait a second, you brought muscle?
Means I was wrong. My patient doesn’t have Parkinson’s. Cuddy knows that’s the only reason I wouldn’t want to stay here with my pain pills, porn, and you forever. [Tries to sit up, Nurse Dickerson pushes him back down.]
[Lying on his couch using his mobile.] How did you eliminate Parkinson’s?
I assume you’ve already ruled out hepatitis and Wilson’s.
Then if she’s wrong, that makes this phone call that much more exciting. What about hepatic fibrosis?
Did I mention this diagnosis needs to make sense?
If he got paralysed while driving the bus, don’t you think I would have gotten off at the next stop?
The bus would have slowed, I would have noticed –
Genetic test is too slow. [Nurse takes phone away from him so he yells out.] Run the bagel test!
[In his bathroom using a different phone.] So the carbo-loading marathon isn’t working. [Kutner looks around surprised.] Stop looking around suspiciously. To answer your next two questions, no, I am not there, and yes, you are completely predictable. If the test had worked, you would have called to put my delicate brain at ease. [Nurse knocks on the bathroom door.]
[Yells out.] Still wiping! [To Kutner.] Put the phone up to bus driver’s grill. [Kutner does as he’s told and House listens to the bus driver’s breathing.]
My large colon. [To Kutner.] TPP is not consistent with your patient’s laboured breathing.
My large colon did. I’m negotiating its release.
What’s happening?
You’re half right. He’s wheezing, isn’t he?
You can’t wheeze without moving your chest muscles. This isn’t TPP.
Well how am I supposed to know? I’m not there! [Hangs up the phone.]
So why haven’t you pushed a vial of tPA?
At the tail end of me patiently explaining how you idiots were idiots.
That means it’s not a clot.
Must have just screwed up the intubation. [Checks the tube.] Seal’s good.
Wait, wait. [They stop.] Look at his teeth. He’s got shiny new caps. He’s had recent dental surgery.
House! [Turns around and sees Thirteen standing there.] Oh. [To Thirteen] Get a syringe.
Listen to me. [She stops.] Dental air drill pushed an air bubble into his gums. Dislodged while he was driving, and caused a myoclonic jerk. That’s what I must have seen. Then it hit his spine, his liver, and now his lungs. [Moves the pillows from his head and sticks them under his feet.]
I’m not plumping his pillows here. I’m putting him in the Trendelenburg position to move the bubble to the apex of his heart so you can suck it out, now get the damn syringe.
Stab him.
See? She doesn’t even know your name. [Yells.] Stab his heart! [Machines start beeping.]
Yes, he's suffocating.
Shut up and make a decision. You keep standing there, he’s dead either way.
[Holds up his hands.] Don’t shoot!
The other nurse always used to tuck me in.
Worrying about me?
I’m not sleepy, Mummy.
Who are you? And why are you stalking me?
[Looks at her necklace which is a yellow orangey colour with something in it.] What is that? Mosquito?
In the ointment. So there’s something wrong. There’s some detail I’m not noticing that’s spoiling the big picture.
Is this significant? Or is this dream just going in a different direction now?
[House looks his hand which has a red ribbon in it.] I have to tie this around you. [Ties it around her leg.]
Stay with me. Why did I say that? [Blood starts to ooze onto the ribbon.]
Hey.
It’s not over. [She turns around and looks at him.] I saved the wrong person. [She sits up.]
This wasn’t just a dream or a fantasy, or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.
Nope. I got the causation flipped. The bubble didn’t cause the crash. The crash caused the bubble to dislodge. There was no myoclonic jerk. I saw something else in someone else.
What’s the most dangerous thing a patient could do when his brain is on the brink of herniating?
Instead of sleeping, I’m going to be pacing around this apartment trying to decipher those visions.
I don’t know. Heart rate?
BP? [She walks away and grabs a stethoscope.] Contextual memory. I need to get back on that bus with all 31 passengers to remember who and what I saw.
Maybe I don’t need the actual victims.
Who’s playing Anne McKeehan? [Cameron raises her hand.] Right here. Jane Doe #2 from Princeton General. [Hadley.] Right here. You two, that’s right. Goth kid. [Points to where to sit, Kutner sits there.] Yeah. [Foreman walks up to House.] At the back on the right. [Foreman sits.] Yeah. Here. [Everyone is now in their places.] Okay...
Well, if only you’d stop talking, the re-enactment could stimulate activity in my hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex.
It just slipped away. [Takes some pills.]
Nope. Just a little memory pick-me-up.
That’s the point. It’ll speed up my neuronal firing. Turn up the voltage on my memory.
Just now? Or including the ones I took on the ride over?
[Looks to his right and sees the mystery woman sitting facing him. She is wearing a red scarf now.] Why are you here?
You have something to tell me.
That’s asking, not telling. Who are you?
If I did, I’d be passed out in bed instead of OD’ing on physostigmine on the 6th Street cross-town.
[Looks down at the necklace.] Resin.
I don’t know. Why the guessing game?
And if I don’t, you don’t. But you know the clues.
[Looks at the necklace again, realises and whispers.] No.
[Shakes his head.] Doesn’t make sense.
Amber.
I have to tie this around you. [Removes the red scarf from around her neck and uses it as a tourniquet around her right leg.]
Stay with me. Just stay with me.
Amber.
Amber. It was Amber. [Tries to sit up, Cuddy helps his head onto her lap.] She was on the bus.
Have you spoken to her?
I don’t know... Jane Doe #2.
She was on the bus with me. She’s the one who’s dying.
He's been gone two months. He can wait till I finish slaying a guy in a skullcap and a pair of tights.
On advice of counsel, I assert my privilege pursuant to the fifth.
Uh, I think it was after... When did his girlfriend die? He wanted time alone. I considered being a horrendous pain in the ass, but I didn't want to tread on your turf.
I've gotta remember to close the blinds.
I dated her. Well, not really dated her. More metaphorically raped her by having a penis. [to Foreman] You did too.
Well, either she cracked under the whip, or she started to realize that her evolutionary purpose is to arouse men, not to castrate them. Send her to psychiatric.
Then it's the latter. Send her to my apartment. [He reaches for the file.]
Sorry, can't help you. You need a specialist to remove those kind of warts. Preferably one with experience spelunking.
Hallucinations, possible memory loss. Tests show anemia, slow heart rate, and a stubborn refusal to shave her pits.
Nope. But I have seen the patient's frequent flyer balance. Eastern Europe, Asia, third-world countries. Sometimes more than one a day.
Is Wilson hallucinating ants crawling all over him too? Tox screen's cleaner than the windows she won't do. [His pacing brings him to the windows for the second time. He looks out.]
[big sigh] Great. Now everyone knows.
Is that what she said? I thought she said, "I am suddenly and irrationally defending the patient's strong career, even though in reality she's just a glorified grunt, because I'm trying to convince myself that it's okay not to have a life because I don't have a life, because I was tested for Huntington’s, and my life span's been cut in half." Been waiting two months for her to say that.
Hyper segmented polys says that Taub's right. Pump her full of B12. See how a strong career woman's been made sick by her strong career.
My patient is still fighting in the feminist trenches, but the war is over. Yesterday's sluts are today's empowered women. Today's sluts are celebrities. If that isn't progress —
What, are you gonna take another two months? Boy, you're really milking this bereavement thing, aren't you? [pause] I mean, good for you. You take all the time you need.
Okay. That's an understandable reaction.
You of all people should know, this is bereavement 101. You think that a change of venue —
I'm not saying you're not in pain.
I'm saying that pain fades.
Physical pain is different.
Well, you don't know that 'cause you haven't felt —
Busy.
Actually, as you can see, I’m not busy. It's just a euphemism for "get the hell out of here." [She leaves. House turns back to Wilson.] This is your grief talking. And, yeah, it is a bit textbook. So before you give away all your possessions to the Salvation Army —
[sighs] Two false positive pregnancy tests, bradycardia, lower GI bleed. Go.
Also would have shown on a sonogram.
No urinary bleed. [He looks through the closed blinds on his window and starts walking out of the office.]
Keep going.
You're being an idiot. You're gonna blow up your career. And six months from now, when you've moved on from Amber to burnt sienna, you're gonna be stuck in a mobile oncology truck in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.
You can't hide from misery.
My skull was cracked open trying to save her!
Who's obviously not going anywhere with a bloody rectum.
Actually, he’s about to thrust a tantō into the belly of his career.
Buy a plant.
I respect things that deserve respect. This decision, on the other hand, is a dog wearing a cape!
The patient tested positive for pregnancy because the patient is pregnant.
You're too busy to be running a Day Care Center in your abdomen.
Not to mention you should wait till at least 30 to punish that pleasure portal with a seven-pound tissue expander.
[looks at her] 37? Impressive. Too bad you’re not passing on those genes. [to Thirteen] Does that look false to you? You were looking in the wrong room. It's more common when the egg lands in the oven. Sometimes it winds up in the fallopian tubes. In rare cases, it plummets through the plumbing entirely. It's using her intestine as a blood supply. It caused the rectal bleed, and now... Junior Miss Steinem’s junior must be pressing on her vagus nerve, slowing her heart to a crawl. Yank the fetus. She survives the surgery, she'll be fine.
She doesn’t.
Just terminating the fetus when it's glued to her intestines is high-risk surgery. Saving it is a fantasy. That was at least three seconds.
People get what they get. It has nothing to do with what they deserve. And this has nothing to do with her genitalia, and everything to do with your genetics.
I didn't know it was gonna color your every medical opinion, every personal opinion.
[He turns to her, angry.] People die! You, Amber, everyone. Don't act like you just figured that out. I gave you a diagnosis. You don't like it, there are exits on every floor.
[approaches] Treating professional sports injuries now?
Familiar with the concept of sarcasm. Don't sweat it, it's new. [to Cameron] Have you spoken to Wilson?
I put the bisexual chick on that. If you'd like to sit in, so to speak...
What'd you tell him?
So you could feel good about doing nothing. You gotta tell him —
She dumped me when I lost the last 85 pounds. Said there was less of me to love.
Grief is Newark. Okay, it's there. You can't avoid it. The idea is to hold your nose, hope the traffic’s not too bad, and get on to Manhattan as quickly as possible, not to buy property.
I'm not the one who's quitting.
But you have. He’ll listen to you. What did you do when your husband died?
See how crappy that worked out?
You have to stop Wilson from committing career malpractice.
I already talked to him twice. He threw me out.
Block his references to other hospitals. Tell him he can’t hand off his cases until —
That's a brilliant idea. I'll take him out for a beer. That'll make up for the fact that Amber's in a pine box. That there's randomness and chaos in the universe.
I didn't kill her.
Yeah, if her daddy hadn’t been drunk, she might never have been born. So —
I didn't ask her to come out. I wasn't driving the bus. I wasn't driving the garbage truck that hit the bus. And I did not prescribe her the flu meds that killed her.
It'd be meaningless.
If I told you that I was sorry, would it change anything?
If you believed me.
I'm going home... [He slides the phone closer to Wilson] …until you agree to stay at this hospital.
Your conscience bleeds more freely than my head. [The phone buzzes again. House picks it up.] Text. Patient's in cardiac arrest. Ouchy. [He puts it back on Wilson’s desk.]
If it keeps you here. Your friendship matters more to me than this patient.
Yeah. But it comes easier for me.
Not at all. You mind if I leave?
And the two ended up dovetailing rather nicely, don't you think?
Because he's my friend, I know what works on him.
Then fire me.
I told him I'm sorry. He didn't believe it.
I don't believe it.
You had my cable disconnected!
Why? Did you think I'm okay with letting someone die, but I'm gonna fold if I can't watch celebrity bowling?
You go, girl.
So what do you want to tell us?
Actually, you should read the psych literature. Repression's gaining a lot of fans. What you don't face can't crush you.
[to Wilson, pleasantly] How you doing? Good?
Think you're an idiot. We both also eat with forks. That doesn't really prove —
I told him he's an idiot.
I think he's an idiot.
You told me what your position is on that one. You're against it, right?
So much for that theory.
[stands] Same time next week?
It's almost 4:00. Soap time. [He reaches over the desk and grabs something.] Nurses' remote. Works in the doctors' lounge.
How many times do I have to use the word "idiot"?
Try it sometime. You'll see why.
You look 37.
You looked 27 last week. Unless I blacked out for ten years. Your skin —
Stop the chemo.
She have bruising? [He takes a syringe from a drawer.]
It's not lymphoma.
My bad. Thought no meant yes. Those aren't bruises. They're mycobacterial lesions. She has diffuse lepromatous leprosy. Must have caught it on one of her overseas estrogen tours. Chemo wipes out some of the bacteria, she feels a little better. Wipes out most of her immune system, she gets a whole lot worse.
Actually, this is the flattering one. It's also known as "pretty leprosy." It doesn't disfigure, it makes your skin look younger, smoother. Don't let the girls hear. They'll all want to lick your face. Unless you're that kind of feminist. [to Taub and Thirteen] Blast her with antibiotics and prednisone. She'll be fine. [He looks at his watch.] Damn, it's after 4:00. I'm late. [He leaves.]
I like you better now that you're dying.
You took a shot.
You thought something would change?
Almost dying changes nothing. Dying changes everything.
I'm sorry. I know I didn't try to kill her. I know I didn't want her hurt. I know it was a freak accident. But I feel like crap, and she's dead because of me.
Then we're okay? I mean, I know you're not, but... Maybe I can help.
What did Wilson do for me?
Oh, sure, he made me laugh on a rainy day, made me see the colors I never knew —
On the other hand, Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh. And how many colors are there really? Once you got red, blue, and green —
[getting up to leave] It's cancer.
You're right, of course. What was I thinking?
The fighter's irrelevant.
It would be a coincidence if six transplant recipients had nothing else wrong with them — like being an idiot, which leads to getting your head knocked off. The others had cancer.
Redo the thousand tests and the four autopsies. Taub and Kutner, check out the donor. Find out which cancer —
Find out which cancer would have killed him. Check the home and office for carcinogens, toxins —
Find out which cancer killed them. [Foreman stands with his arms folded while the others leave.] Did I forget you? You can check out the patient's eye.
Put this on Dr. O'Shea. [He reaches over Dr. O’Shea.] And some chips.
No.
[quietly, as he follows O’Shea toward the tables] Check.
Word is you're into monster trucks.
But not you?
You're astute. [He takes some pills.] No.
Vicodin, opioids, some B12. Need a little kick in the afternoon. You got a problem with that? [O’Shea ignores him and picks up some food from his tray.] I think I'm falling in love.
No, it's not. Everyone else's transplanted organs were fine. It means her eye is fine.
It's her only working eye.
[to O’Shea] Do you have some ethical problem with what I'm doing that you could express in a unique way which might actually make me think that I'm wrong even though I'll never admit it?
You are funny. [to Foreman] The problem's not in her eye. It's in her head. [to O’Shea] You wanna come over and watch Prescription Passion at my place tonight?
Neither am I. If you don't want to have sex, that's cool with me.
I'll grow on you.
Whatever he's got, you've got. Fifth line.
Pretty sure. Fifth line.
Can we talk about something besides you for a moment? Like maybe the fifth line?
Damn.
A moment ago, you thought you were dying. Blind's actually good news. Unfortunately, he's wrong.
She didn't squint. Which means the eye thinks it's fine.
I know. The eye doesn't think. The brain thinks, which means if the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong. Which means it's spread to the brain, which means it's too late for us to remove the eye. Which means we're gonna have to remove your whole head. Don't worry. [He holds up a huge meat cleaver.] It doesn't hurt.
Hallucination. That's a brain thing, right?
It does if one of the other organ recipients also had a brain issue. Did he just drop his hands? [They’re watching film of the kick boxing fight.]
If his pupils dilated, if his pupils were fixed, if there was a twitch...
Yesterday. You live, you learn. Who shot this?
Can't see the dead guy's face. I can't see his face. Can't see the twitch, can't see the pupils —
What kind of idiot wears argyle socks with construction boots?
He's apparently a very bad private investigator.
Because I wanted to find out what you guys found out before I find out what he found out. So I can find out if I need a private investigator. So, nu?
I'll get you a check.
You think I'm gonna stop payment?
Of course I am, $2,300 is insane.
Pupils were dilated.
Say it.
God, that was petty of me.
It's the whole reason you went to medical school. I'm not gonna take that away from you.
And costs more. Gonna biopsy the brain.
Say it.
Temporal lobe controls speech, hearing, memory. She loses those things, she's gonna be a terrific date, but beyond that —
You're right. She has so much to live for. [They’re standing outside the patient room. They look at Apple.] Do we have another patient who's almost finished with all their living? [House moves a couple of steps down so they’re looking at Frank.]
No, it's okay to stab his brain because he's dead if you don't. Get the widow to say yes.
Did you get the consent?
Tell Foreman to get it. Old people are scared of black people.
Save the brain. Don't need consent for an autopsy.
Well, at best, we're gonna bat one for six on this one.
Brain's clean. Moving on.
Metabolic diseases specialize. Everything else specializes, but cancer plays the field.
Metastasis is just a fancy word for screws around.
I don't know.
There is. We just haven't found it yet.
Give me something else that explains this constellation of patients, then you can call me an ass.
Okay. It's a long shot. It is possible that I'm an ass. Ironically, we need to do a colonoscopy to confirm.
She starts getting abdominal pain, shove a tube up her rear before it can get away. And test anyone else with stomach pain.
Not everyone. The one thing the donor gave to each of these people is his DNA. Anyone else have his DNA?
She has a tummy ache. If Kutner's right, it's not a tummy ache, it's a fatal brain or heart or lung or liver or pancreas ache.
Fine. Tell her the truth. Then ask if daddy knows who the real daddy is.
What if a kid wants ice cream?
What'd you find out?
'Cause I need to know if he lends money interest-free. What did you find out?
I don't know the guy. I got no logical reason —
You're taking pictures of a guy who's having an affair with his own sister. And you're lecturing me about the rewards of trust.
Do you have a special rate plan for being a pain in the ass?
Which type am I?
You lead with the irrelevant types?
That's an actual type?
How do you know about Wilson?
You checking me out? Have I been paying for that?
[House thinks, then looks away as he asks] Is there?
I gotta go. I'll get you a check.
Then that just leaves cancer.
Yes, the fact that it didn't prove anything didn't prove anything. Excellent point.
Unfortunately, we can't know when shortly before death is until shortly after death. And that seems like an obstacle.
Then we're kind of all sweating over nothing.
Do it.
What if we don't have conversations we've already had? Four out of the five didn't linger. They got sick and died. We don't have time to dismiss things we've already dismissed.
See, that's an example of a conversation we've already had. She's sick. Something fits.
[exasperated] No! Okay, from now on, no one says anything unless no one's said it before.
You guys start immuno-gels on her CSF to look for hidden protein markers. Then start sequencing her genes. I'm gonna start treatment. [He gets his jacket from the coat rack and opens the door.]
Cancer.
It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.
She's fine. Where's her chart?
I know. That was bad of me. But I'm pretty sure the chart's supposed to be attached to the bed so that gimp doctors don't have to look all over the place while patients die. [She picks up the chart from the table past the curtains and gives it to him.] Thank you so much. And some peppermint tea when you get a chance. [She gives him a “look” and leaves.]
No.
Nope.
That's a good question. It deserves a complicated answer. Placebo effect. People have confidence in doctors. They have confidence in diagnoses, confidence in medicine. Sometimes they get a little better just because they think they will. And that can make us think that the wrong answer is the right answer. Which is very bad.
If that were true, and it would certainly make sense, do you think I could tell you that it's true? [enormous wink. She signs.]
Didn't you cover all this personal stuff with Dr. Foreman?
You're a post-corneal transplant math teacher. I deduced that you were a blind math teacher.
[interested] You gave up architecture after you could see?
No.
You're fun.
I haven't given up. [He leaves.]
So who are we following?
You point at the target?
[House focuses on the target with his cane.] Pretty. Who hired you?
You're stalking her?
You are stalking her, just not for very long. So what else can you tell me that I might care about?
What…? [He turns to join Lucas.] If she turns her head, she's gonna see that we're walking the wrong direction.
Well, I'm not.
How do you know what they're talking about?
You'd get laid more often if you told them you lost a kid.
You're a PI who can't lie?
[simultaneously] No.
Lesson one: Commit.
She's not your type. Your type is much stupider than her. What did Wilson say about me?
In the grief counseling or in the other —
I could tell at once.
It's not cancer.
Labs show that our patient is healthier. She's gonna get sicker. Then she's gonna die. I brought Thai food.
Nothing. It's not cancer. All the tests say it's not cancer. They've always said it's not cancer.
Eh, treatment proves it could be cancer. It's not cancer.
I never thought it was cancer.
I thought that what she had acted like cancer. If it acts like cancer, maybe it'll respond like cancer.
We have to find something that walks like cancer, talks like cancer, tastes like cancer, [pops some food in his mouth] but isn't cancer.
I do. And so does Tetrault.
The dead tuba player.
The point is, he died last, but he died. Which means she's gonna die too.
There's a cancer drug that's used off-label for arthritis.
Did you interview all the tuba students?
Then it wasn't in his hands.
One of them is Canadian. Brought him methotrexate so he could hide his arthritis. Already couldn't afford his insurance. And that little piece of business cost me $700. I'm gonna pass it on to the patient with a steep mark-up.
I know. She's dead unless we can find what's cancer... but not cancer. [They all think, silently.] Something's missing.
I need an epiphany. [Wilson stares at him, tight-lipped.] What are you billing out at, $300 an hour? Here's four.
Better oncologists. But I need you. [He balls up the money and throws it past Wilson into the apartment.] Let me describe the symptoms, problems, issues, and you say whatever you feel like saying, until something triggers an idea in my head.
You have a way of thinking about things. It's sloppy, it's undisciplined, it's not very linear. It complements mine. It drives me down avenues that I wouldn't otherwise —
Cancer, but not cancer. Responds to cancer treatment, but there's no — [Wilson tries to close the door but House blocks it.] How are you?
By hanging out with Cameron, talking to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me. I… [short, mirthless laugh] I paid a private investigator to spy on you.
You want to move on from me, you got to deal with me, talk to me.
We're not friends anymore. There's no trust to be breached. I can have you followed, I can call you names, tell your secrets. [They look at each other.] Foreman did a CT. Temporal and frontoparietal regions are normal. Occipital lobe, normal.
Nothing yet. Keep talking.
You charge me for listening in on my own conversations?
How many friends do you have?
Seriously? You have a list?
Well done. I have one. Had one.
Shut up. Friends allow you to not sit in a room by yourself. Are you charging me for this?
No.
Do you wanna be my friend?
He thinks if he's not a friend, he can't talk to me. We can talk, we can be two human beings talking —
Yes, you did. I was in the middle of a sentence.
I'm grateful. Make your point.
And anything can be anything. [looks at his watch] 10:10. Stop the clock. [He starts walking away.]
The world is not as ugly as she thinks it is.
Cancer, but not cancer. Doesn't make any sense unless... [He pulls an x-ray from a folder.] Brain, but not brain. Occipital lobe's normal. But her eyes suck. That lobe should be compensating. Since it's not, that tells me that something's in there that shouldn't be in there. Brain, but not brain.
To find the anomaly, I need to chop off the top of her head. Pretty sure I need your approval for that.
I'm not usually confused when you say things like that.
Cancer stem cells are real. They explain everything. They're like embryonic stem cells. They become whatever they want. Donor had them, the recipients got them. They floated around, they landed on an organ, got bathed in cytomes and partially differentiated. And the key word there is partially. In the tuba player, they became lung, but not lung. In the tennis player, they became heart, but not heart. Stop me if you've figured out the pattern. They looked as if they belonged, but they weren't doing their jobs. And when they were really needed, boom. Chemo worked because cells are basically tumors. Chemo shrunk them. [He looks at her.] You're still gonna say no, aren't you?
I have the brain scan.
This is why I need to take off her head.
To treat. Chemo's not killing anything. It's just hiding the real problem. She's gonna crash. If we wait until she does crash, it might be too late.
I would never do that.
[on intercom from observation area] You might want to check her IV. From here, it looks like saline instead of chemo.
Still. You should probably check.
How could I? I had no access.
Do the surgery.
No reason not to. The stupidly dangerous part is already over with.
Except for the part that isn't brain.
I'm a better liar than you are.
Yup. The neural net will show us how fast her neurons are firing. If there's something in the way, say... Brain that's not brain, the normal neural impulses will be sucked into a vortex because they're unable to do their job. The computer will then process it and give us a picture of where to cut.
Excuse me?
I'm on the clock.
[looks at monitors next to him.] I see it. Can you get it?
Turns out you didn't kill her.
How'd you know who it is?
Yeah, like you're a field of roses. [He pushes the emergency buzzer for the nurses. The same two enter.] Peppermint tea.
Never really bought that. I don't care how often a kid cries, he's being eaten by a wolf, mom's gonna come running. [The nurses leave. To Apple.] The world is ugly. People kill. They go hungry. [He buzzes again. Just one nurse comes in.] Just proving a point. [She leaves.] People are asses.
Because the world is not as ugly as you think it is. Your transplanted cornea's fine, your eye is fine, but your brain wasn't working right. I'm gonna take the gauze off your eyes now. It's gonna be bright.
The brain cells that weren't brain cells were in the way of processing visual information correctly. After the transplant, you could see, but not see.
Yeah, but it was dull, or foggy, or gray. I don't know. What I do know is that you were not seeing what everyone else was seeing.
Things'll be what they are. [He removes the last of the bandages.] How do I look?
Hey. Is there any way I could put you on retainer?
Why's this in here?
[looks at it and smiles] Today is going to be a good day.
[simultaneously] No.
She means are you the private investigator whose bills I've tried to slip through as medical expenses?
Information saves lives. Saving lives saves money.
You don't like her shoes. You like her legs.
Less creepy, more gay.
No idea. Whoever fixed ours is about to get stiffed. [He balls up one of the sheets of paper and tosses it in the trash can. Two points.]
Apparently, a moron. One, ER routinely tests for drugs. If it was positive, we wouldn't be looking at this file. Two, who pays 12% interest on a car loan?
No. That would be illegal. Interestingly enough, paying someone to run it for me, though… [The entire team looks annoyed.] What? It's part of my job.
Which I do with the team. How am I supposed to know how best to utilize that team if I don't know everything about them? Say that Van Gogh turns out to have neurosyphilis, and our last vial of penicillin is in a storeroom at the end of a 20-mile hallway with a two-foot high ceiling.
No. I would never out someone's super powers. [He wheels his chair to his desk and gives Thirteen a pile of papers that was there.] This, on the other hand…
I got nothing on Taub.
Taub's wife, on the other hand…
Dad's right. This is no time for gossip. A patient desperately needs our help. Check his head and his house.
[grabbing report out of Thirteen’s hand] Nope. He's very busy.
So is his head. Even with contrast, no masses, no lesions. A neurological symptom with no apparent neurological cause.
Just leaves toxins or drugs.
Yeah. When she said it, she had other options. And I really just wanted to segue into her stupid loan and your —
Really?
Is his girlfriend hot? I'm not talking fever here. I mean, is she all curvy and perky?
That explains why all his paintings suck. And what's wrong with him. [He starts to leave.]
To tell him he may have a massive brain tumor.
I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.
You seem to have a massive brain tumor.
We found no trace on any of your imaging, so we need to cut your head open. It's risky, but it's the only way to save your life.
Wrong answer.
You're not allowed to not be terrified. There's only two good reasons not to be terrified in a hospital. You're delusional. But then you're not afraid of contrast material either. Or you know you're fine. Since we haven't told you you're fine, you obviously have information that we don't have. What drugs are you on?
Drug tests only test for drugs they've made tests for.
Hottie thinks that he's a great artist, selling art to the rich and tasteful. She's stupid enough to be fooled by the canvases, but bank accounts don't lie. He needed money. [to Brandon] There's not many jobs you can do that don't require time, training, and intelligence. And I know you're not a news anchor or a supermodel, 'cause those jobs seldom cause agnosia. [to Thirteen] He's a guinea pig. Companies pay him to test their untested drugs. [pause. Brandon doesn’t say anything.] Did hottie go for a pee or coffee? Either way, I don't think we should waste any time on denials.
Admirable. Not many idiots have that much ambition. You've been symptom-free since your admission, so whatever you took has probably cleared your system now. You'll be fine. [to Thirteen] Keep him overnight, just to make sure, and get the names of all the trials he's been in. [He starts to leave.]
[as he’s closing the door] Couldn't, even if I cared enough to want to.
Not bad. You almost made it the whole day.
The point is to see how everyone reacts. Let me go get the rest of the gang.
Your wife has a separate bank account in her name only. She's been making weekly cash deposits for about a year now. No withdrawals… yet.
A secret bank account.
Because if it wasn't, you'd call it "the" bank account.
You're spending almost $100,000 on furniture?
She is hot.
Obviously the drugs weren't out of his system.
By themselves, no. But three unproven, untested drugs? It’s like the mod squad. No one could stop them.
Just to short-circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate. But people won't test drugs unless they're desperate. We need drugs to save children and puppies. Ergo, we need desperate people. Ergo, welfare kills sick children.
Why don't we call it bisexidrine? [The others stare at him.] Clinical trials involve experimental drugs. Means they don't have comforting, catchy names yet. Just random, unmemorable trial numbers. [to Thirteen] Go ahead.
Cuckoldisol.
Worse. Sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional. Can be easily regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.
Shocking. Discuss.
Worldssorestkneesisil. [Kutner smiles] Cuddy used to have that title, by the way.
And it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the problem. Unfortunately, we don't have to. We just have to stop the interacting.
Stop them all. Put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.
Difference is, we know what those risks are. Put him on dialysis.
And I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office. The only difference is I'm gonna be right in front of other people. Which means you're not here to talk about the medicine.
What did she say?
I heard the part about “you can screw with me at work all you want.”Want my advice?
Good, 'cause I have no idea what you should do. I only know what you're going to do. You're gonna —
I said this is not advice. You are going to forgive her for opening that account, and you're going to confess everything you've done, and then you're gonna beg her to forgive you.
None. Which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.
Where are you?
That's, like, six miles away. How cool are these things?
You have those night vision goggles?
You're lying.
He deserved to know the truth.
You do know that stuff exists even when you can't see it, right?
First of all, stop saying "a" truth. There is only one truth.
[leaving the elevator and talking loudly] Miserable people save more lives. If your life has meaning, your job doesn't have to have meaning. Screw-ups are more palatable if you have someone's arms to go cry in.
Usually I have more of a fight on that one.
I just said!
[studying papers in front of him] Why would you pay for a three-year gym membership and only go twice? [The others stare at him.] Sorry. You guys still diagnosing? Thought we'd finished hours ago. You remember, when we decided it was the unproven, unapproved cocktail of drugs he's been downing like… well, like a cocktail.
Or he'd be worse. [pause] I take it none of you saw Trainspotting.
You think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?
[fiddling with pill bottle] Either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence. If it's one, we have to find a better way to detox him. If it's two, we have to know which symptoms are withdrawal-related before we can formulate a diagnosis. Which means we have to find a better way to detox him. [takes Vicodin]
Hair of the drug that bit him.
That's why we're gonna put him back on the drugs, and then wean him off again. Just much slower. [The fellows look at Foreman.] Why are you looking at him?
You heard the boss! Go!
Taub —
Good point. Coming clean can cause a lot of damage. Alienation, divorce.
I was talking about the patient.
Divorce was metaphorical.
Good thing he's got that girlfriend. If it's Kluver-Bucy, his brain'll melt down, he'll try to swallow his own hands, and she can take care of him for the rest of his talentless life.
You're right. Fact is, nothing I said applies. You had no reason to forgive her. Therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness. No reason to be an idiot.
Then again, she is handing you a giant gift that you don't think you deserve.
Foreman's right. [to Taub] Go call your wife, tell her you're not coming home 'cause you have to give the patient a cranial MR angiogram. Then say good night and hang up.
[hands Lucas his jacket] You wanna hang this up when you're done?
No, you don't.
[getting beer from the refrigerator] Well, if you hand her that, she's not gonna need you anymore.
I don't care if she thinks you're incompetent.
It's worked so far.
I know. That's why your cover is that you want to do her. [takes Vicodin]
Then what's the point of liking her?
Something… personal. Something embarrassing. I spend half my life negotiating with that woman. Anything I can use to scare her into saying yes.
Okay? You're okay with being paid twice to facilitate blackmail?
Narrow for you, normal for him. If there were problems with the vessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago.
Like?
I know "heart" and "head" start with the same three letters, but you gotta read all the way to the end.
Been home?
Good. Do an EP study. Find the arrhythmia.
Guilt fades quickly. By Wednesday, you'll be fine.
Because… if it ain't broke —
You obviously think it ain't. Your marriage is like a broken toaster. Bread keeps popping out, and you keep calling it toast. Which is weird, because you've put your bread in a lot of toasters and apparently you don't see any difference. It's kind of fascinating.
Good news. The test is working. Your heart's freaking out, but it's cool that you're still conscious.
Have you been dyeing your hair? [He’s inspecting Brandon’s temples.]
Right. [steps back]
The hair is growing in red.
[to Taub] Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing… or just dying.
Red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy. Melanin affects hair color. What affects melanin?
He's turning prematurely crimson?
And make you deaf. Next.
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.
But not the ginger nut.
It also gives him the likelihood of sudden and unexpected death.
Pete Best. [The others look at him, waiting.] Good God! Has none of you ever read a history book? The original Beatles drummer. A bunch of nerves controls the tempo of the heart. They're all playing in time, except one dude can't keep the beat. Wrecks the whole thing. So we hire Ringo.
Probably should have just said that, huh?
So he saves a fortune on karaoke machines and deodorant.
If he was, he wouldn't need it.
It's irrelevant. [He’s pacing and the other two follow him.]
Since it points towards the same disease. Intermittence can fit with Romano-Ward. We still need to do a sympathectomy.
When? When you checked every bottle, every can, every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?
That's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.
So where you gonna get this old paint? City dump?
If you're wrong, he could drop dead from Romano-Ward at any moment. You okay with that?
You got one.
He's not on the drugs. [He sits down.]
They're hiding under the stairs.
I said stairs, not closet. What was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?
Antacid.
It makes sense. Also, I'm looking at the file.
Damn. So you didn't get anything.
On the other hand, I figured she probably wouldn't figure me as the "photoshopping a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper" type either.
You took a little trip 150 miles.
There was a girl.
You know, people hate people who have theories about people.
Would you?
I picked Cameron’s pocket down in ER. I came up with a doozy.
She's still healthy. This 25-year-old woman, on the other hand…
Well, that's the way women sound when their spouse of 50 years dies. [He goes into his office, hanging his cane from the top of the doorframe as he enters.]
Yep. Fine! Our patient, who's been known to take a few drinks on non-occasions, vomits blood and collapses on a trip to China. Chinese surgeons cut out a foot of bowel, but the pain is worse now than it was before.
What are you, my mom?
Are those bags under your eyes? You were up all night. You told her, didn't you?
[to the others] Told his wife he's been getting some strange. She kicked his adulterous tuchus to the curb.
Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right? Get it translated.
Too high up for a colonoscopy. CT could miss it. Ultrasound's fastest. And since I'm fastest with the ultrasound…
I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't even like the man.
No Meckel’s. [He hands her a box of tissues.] Were you there for the rice or the reeducation camps?
Like a salmon returning to the stream where it was born. Did you become whole again, or did you get eaten by bears?
Four parents, and not one of them taught you to cover your mouth.
I'm just a technician. Her doctors will be by later. You can schmooze then.
I'm a technician and a doctor.
No. [He finds a plastic baggie that interests him.]
Licorice root.
I threw it to you for a reason. That's what the Chinese doctors gave her. It contains glycyrrhizin.
Not very effectively. But SARS explains the cough, causes hypoperfusion, which explains the ischemic bowel. It's perfect.
[getting on elevator] Okay, well, so call it "ARS." Start her on ribavirin and interferon.
I'm not. Are we done emoting now?
You know, you're right. I don't think I can sleep alone tonight. [Cuddy produces a syringe.] And you can tell me that that is liquid Vicodin.
[He stands, unbuckles his jeans and leans on the desk.] You know, I usually pay tens of dollars to hear that.
My mom called you?
"Eulogy," from the Greek for "good word." Now, if she asked me to deliver a bastardogy, I'd be happy to —
She knows when I'm lying.
Cuddy drugged me. She… My mom didn't call Cuddy. She called you. I knew you couldn't stay away. I knew you loved me too much.
I'm not doing this at all. If there were something to be done, I would have done it in the year he spent dying. [He checks his pockets.] You took my Vicodin? I'm in pain. [Wilson pulls the Vicodin bottle from his inside pocket, opens it and gives House a pill, all without looking at him.] One? So the Vicodin is my leash. One'll take the edge off, but it won't give me enough relief for an escape back to Plainsboro. [He swallows it.]
Where's my phone? [Wilson ignores him.] It's the team. It's their ring tone. [nothing] Forget it. The patient's blood is on your hands.
I'm being held against my will. Call the police!
Thanks for calling. [He disconnects the phone.] My ring tone for you is "Dancing Queen," by Abba.
I need to pee. Pull over at the next stop. [Wilson hands him a plastic bottle. House tosses it over his shoulder into the back seat.] I'll just pee on the floor. [He looks at the floor, grins and picks something up.] You bought used floor mats? That is brilliant. [He rolls down the window, tosses the mat out and starts to unbuckle his pants.]
Cane.
I suppose I could talk about the summer he decided he wasn't speaking to me. Two months, not one word. Anything he wanted to say, he typed up and slipped under my bedroom door.
Just by being there, I’d be lying.
Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral.
I said I'd go to the funeral. I didn't say when.
You actually keep a flashlight that doesn't need batteries in the trunk? Next to the jacket, emergency water, nail clippers, tooth brush, space blanket —
No, she didn’t. Not unless your pet name for her was "Volvo." [Wilson goes back to the trunk and pulls out another wind-up flashlight.] A man who would lie about a gift from a dead girlfriend…
The struggle to resist one's captors is never pointless. Vive la résistance!
[shakes head] My father was a punctual man, beholden to time. Two minutes late for dinner, you didn't eat. My mother would never disrespect him by starting the funeral late.
Come on, forget the keys. Call a locksmith. We'll go inside and play "guess that smell" with the truckers while we're waiting. Join me on the dark side.
No, I'm not.
He's not my biological father. [Wilson looks at him.] I figured it out when I was 12.
I look at the facts. First of all, he was deployed on training exercises off Okinawa during the time I had to be conceived.
His second toe is longer than his big toe. Mine isn't.
I have a distinctive red birthmark on my scalp that matches a certain friend of the family.
Uh-oh.
You lost track of your speed? I think that was Hitler’s excuse. Lost track of the Jews. No one held him responsible.
You were protecting me. Anybody in their right mind would have ratted me out.
Make it fast. I don't want to miss the anal cavity search.
Not to me. This is radio. And I want a full play-by-play.
Cyst?
Wilson's getting arrested. How large? SUV sized, or mid-range sedan?
I'm obviously joking. If Wilson was getting handcuffed on the hood of his car, would I be carrying on a differential?
[whistles] Is it in the tail or in the head?
[ignoring him] We've got a construction site. A steamroller is plowing —
I need that phone call. I'm a doctor, and when someone tries to call you three times, it's code for "pick up the damn phone before someone dies."
You'd be surprised.
I did.
I took care of it. You must've screwed up somehow.
It's suspended when you flee the state.
You heard the man, Wilson. You don't have to explain.
He's my father. I have the right to avoid his funeral.
It's a great song. He was out of line.
Yeah, you yelled politely.
And smashed a ten-foot antique mirror. And set an example to two other patrons who threw shot glasses.
No, I was the guy who bailed him out.
It was a boring convention. Had to have somebody to drink with.
Hey, there were 3,000 people at that convention. You were the one I thought wasn't boring. That says something.
I got a lawyer. He cut a deal. You didn't call the guy? You have to show up at the arraignment. Everybody knows that.
What? He — he's a fugitive from justice. That whole story was lies. He stabbed a man.
Forget Louisiana. He was driving recklessly through your comatose village. Do they put lead in the jelly doughnuts here?
Well, of course it's not gallstones. Who thought it was gallstones?
I also said "construction site."
[to Wilson] Will you just turn around. The thing is two hours over already, and that's the third time we passed that colonial with the cross burning out front.
I'm not talking about what caused the cyst. I'm talking about what the cyst caused. Everything.
Unless it's a multiple cyst, with connections to other organs… like a steamroller.
Is that your new stripper name?
Bubbles is right. Go echo. [He hangs up.]
Mom, how could you delay the funeral?
I don't know. Just let the minister or one of his buddies from the corps…
[quietly to Wilson] I am not talking We were strangers who shared some geography 30 years ago.
His issue. Which I deliberately made not my issue.
[looking around] Oh, God, he's here.
I used different words.
I already told you. He didn't speak to me for a summer.
There's a lot of people here today. Including some from the corps. And I notice that every one of them is either my father's rank or higher. And that doesn't surprise me. Because, if the test of a man is how he treats those he has power over, it was a test my father failed. [Wilson looks embarrassed. Blythe looks worried.] This man you're eager to pay homage to, he was incapable of admitting any point of view but his own. He punished failure, and he did not accept anything less than —
He loved doing what he did. He saw his work as some kind of… sacred calling. More important than any personal relationship. Maybe if he'd been a better father, I'd be a better son. But I am what I am because of him, for better or for worse. And I just — I just wish —
Well, he's not gonna miss it.
You really want to do this in front of everybody? You wanna punish me or them?
Oh, cut the crap. You enjoy what I do. I never had to force you. You like coming along for the ride.
This is about you needing to be prepared for the worst. So you become an oncologist. No surprises there. Worst happens all the time. But Amber, she was young and healthy. Her death came out of nowhere.
And you weren't ready. That makes you angry. The world sucks, and you didn't have time to brace yourself.
You're scared to death of losing anyone that matters. So you dump the person who matters the most to you!
Because no one can take away from you what you no longer have.
Admit it, you're angry and you're scared of losing me.
Admit it.
Admit it.
Admit it. Admit it!
Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!
Still not boring.
I know you have trouble losing people. In New Orleans, I saw you carrying this express package around the conference. And you wouldn't let it go, but you wouldn't open it. So I peeked at the return address.
Divorce attorneys. Your first wife had just served you with papers.
What did I say about being boring? [He picks up his phone and starts dialing.]
How'd the bubble test go?
The images aren't grainy.
I've seen pictures of you where you look tall. It's iron overload. Creates speckles on the image, makes it look grainy. Also makes her pancreas fail, her blood clot, and her intestine —
MRI for a better view. And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away. I need a phone number.
I'm a doctor in New Jersey, treating one of your clients. A young woman looking for her biological parents.
What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?
Did the parents look tan? The disease she has is genetic, which means they should have it too.
Discolored teeth?
Right. Thanks.
Why not?
Thank you. [He hangs up and turns to Wilson.] Differential. Say you're a middle-aged Chinese woman…
Say it.
Girl comes to you, says that she's your long-lost daughter. Why would you be frightened?
She hasn't seen you since she was an infant.
They're peasants.
'83.
Maybe the baby doesn't die. Maybe the father panics or regrets it. Takes the baby to an orphanage. Maybe he doesn't tell his wife.
Why does attempted murder from 25 years ago suddenly become relevant to her health now?
This is fun, isn't it?
Let me see the MRI.
Then let her vomit through the MRI. That's what nurses are for. [Taub takes the file and leaves.] Her parents tried to kill her. I don't know how, but I know it caused her to get sick 25 years later trying to lift a Buddha. Explain. I already had this conversation with Wilson — just go with it.
Buddha wouldn't make it worse.
Makes sense if she's never lifted anything in her life.
[epiphany] Anybody have Taub’s pager number?
Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain.
Pins. Push them through the soft fontanelle of an infant, you skewer the brain, and the hair hides the entry wounds. It's the perfect crime.
Same thing that changed in the MRI. Shockingly, not all religious leaders are honest. I'm guessing these particular monks are bilking the faithful by pushing a magnet up Buddha’s butt. There's another one under the table that'll repel or attract, depending on how you shift them. When she picked up that magnet, it moved one of the pins deeper into the sympathetic nervous center of her brain. This sent a signal through the nerves to the blood vessels in her small intestine, which caused the symptoms in China and in the giant magnet we call an MRI. She's lucky. We're all screwed up by our parents. She's got documentation.
Is that why you're here? A colleague checking up on a patient?
I'm celebrating. [He hands Wilson a sheet of paper from his desk. Wilson looks at it, then back at House.] My mom hated him too.
It doesn't depress me. Doesn't make any difference at all. That's what depresses me.
If you're coming back just because you're attracted to the shine of my neediness… [Wilson smiles slightly] I'd be okay with that.
You hungry? [Wilson nods. House gets up and they head for the door. House stops.] Wilson.
My dad's dead.
(putting up a finger to stop her) Eh.
(turning quickly and heading out of his office) Not now.
What about me speeding away says to you "let's chat"?
She’s diabetic.
(approaching Wilson’s office) It can wait.
I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.
Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.
I wish I had learned this valuable lesson earlier. I was waiting by my window for an hour. Why are you late?
(turning and opening the door to leave) It’s my way of saying "welcome back." (House leaves. Cameron is still waiting in the hallway)
(looking at the file) Or the ecstasy you found in her system.
(obviously curious) What does Thirteen know about it?
(looking at the file again) At 3:00 AM? (Cameron shrugs)
(lecherously) Oh, yeah! Penthouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God. (He heads back to his office)
Empty transient sex? (to Thirteen) I’ve been waiting for you to spiral out of control, ever since you got your Huntington’s diagnosis, but this is more than I dared hope for.
Depends what we're trying to diagnose. It’s how steep of a spiral you're on.
Is he in this room? Because if he's not, I don't care what he thinks. Unless he's a she and she was there last night too, in which case I care very deeply.
Yet you seem fine.
Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was.
I like to watch. (He follows her out the door)
You’ve already handled it. That’s why you need a chaperone. Of course, I’m a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me.
You know, if you're in the mood to start kissing, or groping, or showering.
I assume my name came up last night in the form of a moan. You had sex, then a seizure. Could be a particular position or activity that set it off. (to Thirteen) That sounds like a valid medical theory, doesn't it?
Lights on or off?
Light sensitivity.
Figured she had more shame than that. Did she talk dirty, or did you rely on vague hand signals? (House is writing something on a clipboard)
I’m learning so much.
Okay, score the score. Scale of one to ten.
(holding up a piece of paper with a large number 7 written on it) Finally got one right. (Thirteen looks thoroughly disgusted)
He claimed he had a morning meeting at Mickey’s Diner. Wilson loves Mickey’s Diner. He has the French toast tower whenever he sets foot in the door. There’s no way he would've come to work wanting more carbs. He lied to me. I need to know why.
I’m worried that he might be, a spy.
I’m just not sure if he's working for Hirohito or the New England Patriots.
I need something to lord over him, a lie —
He always moralized.
Things always change.
Yeah. Find out where he was. (House gets up and leaves)
Eye issue, brain issue, now a heart issue. Sounds like a real case to me.
You’re just upset… Because the whole time she was with you, she was thinking of my huge, throbbing… Diagnostic skills. Drugs would explain everything.
That’s when I thought that Thirteen was right and was just jerking her around. Cardiac arrest means she could be a serious user.
Patient’s dad had bypass surgery. Means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound. That was much less convoluted than what you just said.
Who could pick a lock?
You’re a disgrace to your stereotype. Move over.
No need to pick. (House shows Foreman a key and uses it to unlock the door)
Never. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.
Always imagined she'd have a sex swing in the living room.
Don’t have your key.
Waste of money.
(pointing with his cane) Thirteen had her purse. That’s gotta be the patient's. Check it for drugs. I call shotgun on the bedroom.
Want me to have you investigated? When did you get so needy?
Last night wasn't the first time that Thirteen brought home some strange.
No toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories. First time is plenty exciting on its own. (He takes something from the drawer) Unless…
You think an asthma inhaler could be used as a sex toy? (He gets up of the bed and gives the inhaler a squirt)
People interest me. Conversations don't.
(to Thirteen) Brown recluse. Found it at your apartment. Their venom can cause seizures and heart problems. Unless the ultrasound showed anything —
Bathroom. Nice bidet, by the way. Very refreshing.
Oh. Spider’s not the only interesting thing I found. (He pulls the inhaler out of his jacket pocket)
He doesn't. He’s just surprised he didn't know. You withhold things other people would never bother to. The move, a little wheeze, whatever you thought was in my pocket instead of your inhaler. Maybe I should make a return trip to your place.
Don’t be ridiculous. That would be inappropriate. It’d be better if a woman gropes her. There’s no sexual tension that way. (Thirteen stands to go do the exam)
Which you just wasted with that comment about my comments. Low potassium means her heart problem was a symptom of a kidney problem. What caused the kidney problem?
Not without blood in the urine.
Not with normal blood pressure.
If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications. CT her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis. (House continues on down the corridor, Thirteen heads back to Spencer’s room)
What’s he doing now?
Maybe he was doing something he thinks I’ll mock him for.
Just about anything.
I don't think it's just about anything?
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.
Doesn’t matter if it isn't. Wilson doesn't buy his “pizza.” There’s eight units in this building. There’s got to be a pervert like me living in at least one of them.
Where’s Thirteen?
Not here.
Her lungs are working, but she still can't breathe.
There’s only one way to find out if her airway failed. Make it happen again. Stick Thirteen's carpet cleaner on a treadmill. Methacholine challenge. And someone find the carpet. (The team leaves)
And by brother, you mean?
Wow. Same dad.
You’re right.
That’s because you haven't done anything stupid, spontaneous, or even vaguely interesting since you were 17. And that's just sad. (The elevator door closes)
At least you could've let her finish. She looks terrible.
Unless this is a prelude to an actual spanking, there's no reason for me to be —
(to Cuddy) Because she went to a nightclub in her free time? Or because she had sex in her free time? Patient was undergoing routine surgery for RTA. Didn’t need Thirteen here for that. And I don't need you making my employees punch a clock or pee in a cup. (to Thirteen, nodding his head toward the door.) Let’s go. (Thirteen hesitates)
(opening the door) Come on. (Cuddy looks stunned)
By the way, (they stop) the surgery was not routine, patient stopped breathing and you missed a differential. You’re fired.
No, I just prevented you from getting a drug test. Probably saved your career. I’m already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit. (He pops a Vicodin)
The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass. (He leaves Thirteen looking confused)
I haven't sat on this couch for four months. It remembers my cheeks. I miss this.
Oh, come on. Your patients can wait five minutes. Get me caught up. Come on, what did you do? Travel? Did you get a new hobby? Did you meet someone?
Great. What does she do? Is she… an actress?
I just figured you'd want something a little more… Exciting…
How long have you known her?
I asked a question.
And yet.
If you're happy, I’m… (He gets up suddenly and disappears out the door, leaving Wilson looking puzzled)
Thank you. My employees can take care of it from here. (He sits down behind his desk) We need to biopsy the cysts.
All you proved is you know how to make an entrance.
Who wouldn't have needed saving if Thirteen had shown up at the differential in the first place.
Or what? You’re gonna quit? Go do the biopsy. (Taub and Kutner leave)
How much clearer do I need to make this? (Thirteen looks at House and then, clearly upset, turns and walks out of his office)
He’s an idiot with a messiah complex. Savior to all who need saving. That’s why his first wife had a wooden leg. Second wife was Canadian. He’s the one who needs to be saved.
The ho's just using him for his money. Wait. Bad example.
Proceed directly to the leg-breaking.
Find her, find her family, find client number nine. Just get me something I can use to force her to back off.
Why not men? You’re bisexual. If you were just being self-destructive, you'd be having random sex with men. Better chance of getting assaulted, catching a disease. If this were just about getting laid, it'd be a lot easier to pick up men. Or ugly girls. This woman's hot. Which means you like the challenge, the conquest. It’s the control that gets you off. And controlling women is as close as you can get to controlling what's gonna happen to you.
Instead of getting sweaty with a stranger, why don't you try taking it to the next level? Play God. (he hands Thirteen the file) Tell a girl that she's got ten years to live. She has LAM. (Thirteen looks down at the file)
This is not a test. You’re not getting your job back if you can —
Does the word "fired" have some whole other definition that I’m not aware of? (He turns to face Thirteen)
So you like her now that she's dying. What happens if she stops dying?
Go. Test for everything. (Taub, Kutner, and Foreman leave) (to Thirteen) Not you. You’re just a visitor.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.
Nothing. But we've got a donor match.
I know she has a blood disorder. Could be PNH. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or leukemia. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or thalassemia. She needs a bone marrow —
So we don't radiate her. Her marrow's nearly wiped out already. Counts almost zero.
You got a better idea? She trusts you. Go get her consent.
You’re back.
Genius.
Well, you had no choice. (He closes the door and sits down on the couch) Where were you gonna go after fake hooker girlfriend? How did you know he was outside?
You played to your strengths. By which I mean you played to your weaknesses. (House suddenly realizes something) Oh, my God. You invoked your dead girlfriend's name to sell me. You’re my hero.
It’s $30? Did you keep her number?
Shame. Hungry?
So, seriously. Where were you the other morning?
Then tell me.
(too compliantly) Okay.
It’s what we do.
Good. You’re in a downward spiral of destruction.
You’re gonna keep spiraling. Keep screwing around. Slashing away at every person who tries to help until no one tries to help anymore. Till you hit bottom. Till you're dead. Until then… I can use you.
You did good work.
You connected with a diagnosis, not with her.
(noticing something) Cracks. You’re lips are cracked. (Thirteen puts her fingers to her lips) You been using your inhaler lately?
(thinking) Did she cry? When you told her that she was gonna die, did she cry?
Were. there. tears?
Chopping an onion releases a mist of syn-propanethial-s-oxide, a chemical irritant (House holds the cut onion in front of Spencer’s nose while trying not to tear up himself) which causes people to have a very predictable reaction.
It was either this or put on Brian’s song. I didn't have time to stop by Wilson’s. (House puts down the onion, reaches for a tissue and wipes his eyes) She has Sjogren's. It attacks the glands that produce tears and saliva. Also, by the way, causes lung cysts and RTA.
It’s like you and men. Just 'cause you usually don't, doesn't mean you can't.
Lack of spit makes her mouth a breeding ground for a fungus like Candida. (House picks up the cutting board and the onion and moves it aside) Your asthma inhaler did the same for you. Wiped out your mouth's immune system.
Just the opportunistic infection, not the underlying condition. Another life saved by girl-on-girl action.
Methylprednisolone to get the Sjogren’s under control. And some artificial tears to maximize the visual impact of this moment. (He holds up his hands as if framing a camera shot. Thirteen smiles hesitantly)
Oh, my God! You guys shop here too? Best nipples in Princeton.
(taking off his sunglasses) Because he ate the donut.
Well, you're clearly not pregnant, so either you're buying this as a gift, or this is some kind of weird "if you build it, they will come" moment.
If you're happy, I’m —
Tell him to switch from tequila to bourbon. Worked for me.
Well, then it's epilepsy. Tell him to buy a hockey helmet —
Relax. Just because you got approved by an adoption agency doesn't mean you'll get approved by the birth mother. You're a single mom. That puts you somewhere below couples acquitted in day care scandals.
What time are you seeing the mom?
I just trashed your social value as a mother, and all I got was a little sarcasm. It means you don't feel the need to defend yourself, which means you're not worried about getting a kid, which means you've already got one.
I'm sure the mom'll be thrilled to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.
No, mother's perfectly healthy. She just had to give up the baby in order to continue her work on the human genome.
What they don't confess to is almost always more interesting. This is a mistake.
Because you're a control seeking narcissist. Which is fine, good even, in some jobs. But you're not equipped to handle a real kid, never mind a factory second. Where are you meeting her?
They explained the returns policy, right? It's worse than video games.
Not without a pre-concussion. Pick a number.
Cuddy pool. She got the nod. Little tweaker's due in 14 days.
It's good news. The great news is she insisted that she's not gonna change her mind, which means she's actually thought about changing her mind, which means she's not sure she's ready to be a mom, which means she's not ready to be a mom, which means she's gonna change her mind. The only question is when. $100 buy in. Less than seven means the next seven days.
Not one of the options.
We have a player.
Good thinking. [He adds an “S” in front of Kutner’s name.]I say she's gonna meet the mom and bolt. I'm going for the early fold. [He writes “Jones” in the first column.] Check his home for toxins and his sinuses for thrombosises.
[inspecting the coffee area] Which is caused by…
Or?
I don't know the answer. Which brings us back to — or?
Which means?
So we are?
I honestly don't know where this is going. Just following the clues.
And?
Which we know because?
Which proves he never goes anywhere else… [pause] when… [pause] he's… [longer pause]
Oh, my God, you're right.
Next time, let him keep it. Send him home. See where his dreams take him.
You're losing it. That's what happens when you have kids. Ceaseless crying and nagging leads to irrational fears. It's impressive that you didn't wait for the actual crying and nagging.
Uh-huh. And I'd be an excellent father.
Baby barf. Maternity ward was handing out free samples.
That's exactly my point. It's not gonna be me and a cup. It's gonna be eight times a day. If you can't handle wearing that stain, you can't handle a baby.
I'm a humanitarian.
So Sleeping Beauty has a Jones for Snow White.
Maybe he just forgot.
Fits. Cocaine explains the narcolepsy. Narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking. Whatever is in the cocaine other than the cocaine explains the memory loss.
You can narrow it down in the lab.
So get a sample.
It's exciting.
It's necessary.
Looks like this kid thing is really working out for you. All of the shopping, none of the stretch marks.
Right, kid's getting worse. Blessing in disguise. Although a completely predictable one. You take in strays, don't be surprised by the worms.
I didn't say you weren't stubborn. I said you weren't maternal.
You're getting crankier.
Is it really worth it? Just for the pursuit of unconditional love?
It's a fake thing. There's no unconditional love. It's just unconditional need. Don't make this child a victim of your biological clock.
Yes! Because at least she knows she's not qualified for the job.
No, actually, I was going for "she sneaks her boyfriend in while you're sleeping, and he wants to do it on the desk." And at first she says no, but she has issues with self-esteem.
I'm paying for it right now. With wisdom.
Makes it nutritious.
It is if he's allergic to milk.
How does he like his coffee?
What type of cereal's in the cabinet?
[pushing the button for the elevator] He likes his coffee black. Milk's for the kid.
Because if he drank the milk, he'd know that he's lactose intolerant. Ask him, then treat him for allergic reaction. If he gets better, we all get to go home early. [The elevator doors close, leaving Thirteen and Taub in the lobby.]
So deliver the baby.
So deliver now, risk the baby. Deliver later, risk the mom. It's not your baby yet. It's not your call.
Self-worth issues. That's genetic, you know. You should deliver now.
Are you serious?
The wrong answer. You can give the mom more blood. You can't give the fetus more lungs.
And yet you're here.
See, this is what's screwed up here. You're not sure that this is the right call, but you are sure that this is what you want to tell her. And that scares you because your motives aren't medical. Some part of you doesn't want this baby, and that part wants to tell her to kill it.
Right. Doesn't explain why you changed your sweater.
I need your advice. [He drops a file on the table.]
Wow. Can you remove spleens with your mind too?
Why the hell haven't you come to talk to me about Cuddy? I've been doing all sorts of insane stuff.
That's exactly my point.
She's sleeping with the math teacher to get a diploma.
That's the problem. She gets to have a relationship with a kid, but she can't handle one with an adult. So she's gonna kill it.
Decisions are never made in a vacuum. [He takes back the patient file.]
Why do you think I did that?
Guy's bleeding out of his pores. What does that tell us? Other than that you don't want to play basketball against him and he's dying?
So we have four reasons for leukemia, four reasons against.
Yeah, if we had one reason for anything else. Go do a bone marrow biopsy.
Got him on dialysis?
Too bad. It would've been nice to have more than an hour or two to solve this thing.
He have tiny testes?
His skin's darker, not lighter. As much fun as 20 questions tends to be, he's blowing blood out of every orifice, you think it just might be vascular?
If I had said it might be "vitas gerular," would you have said "Vitas Gerulaitis?" Test him for vasculitis, angio and blood.
Test the daughter.
Small kidney. It just means he won't pee as much. Great for road trips.
So get it.
Got a minute? [Cuddy and Becca both turn to see him leaning into the OR.]
Better question is why is she here? You're an administrator. Administrate. I have a patient's daughter needs a guardian ad litem.
Tests are inconclusive. But either way he's gonna need —
This doesn't need you. I do.
Later's too late.
Mazel Tov. Now it's time to say those magic words you'll be telling her for the rest of her life, “Mommy's gotta go to work.”
[pacing by the window] Damn it. I was hoping you weren't going to ask her that. Of course she knows. Can you just sign the paperwork?
And if you don't do it, daddy will die.
Sorry. Daddy's perfectly healthy. But we want you to give him a kidney anyway because it'd be cool if he had three.
No.
I'm saying I can't. [He leans over to peer into Samantha’s eyes.] Whatever he has, she has too. She's sleepwalking.
When your remote has a dead battery, you don't replace it with another dead battery. Whatever's killing the dad's kidneys is gonna kill the kid's too.
Call Foreman. Get to work.
I need a genetic disease.
Symptoms are kidney failure, bleeding, and insomnia.
It's not over yet. Everyone's happy until they unwrap that pretty present and find they got a wall clock in the shape of Africa.
[leaving] Nope!
Good news. I know what you have, and you're both gonna be fine.
Yes and no.
Yeah.
No idea. They might be.
To make them happy.
Technically, to see if they can be happy. We should've seen a grin, a twinkle, a sigh of relief, something.
They're anhedonic, incapable of experiencing pleasure. Something's bushwhacked their dopamine receptors.
Being bummed doesn't explain their lack of friends or their indifference to each other.
Really? Is that why you do drugs? Because you're happy? Most people do 'em because they want to be happy. His subconscious craved it, needed it.
Sure, in white folk.
They're liars. [to Jerry] What's your name?
Your real name. Hosarian? Herzog? H'ali-baba?
You and your daughter have Familial Mediterranean Fever. It's a genetic disease contracted by people of Mediterranean descent. Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Arabs. Causes anhedonia, seizures, kidney failure, even lactose intolerance. Symptoms are set off by age and stress. Kid couldn't get happy, but she could get stressed by daddy dying.
Treatment tends to be hit and miss once you reach the sweating blood stage. Start them on colchicine and melphalan. [He starts to leave.]
Boy, sure hope I'm right. [He leaves.]
[quietly] There's more than one baby in the sea. The world is full of teenage boys riding bareback.
You're quitting. Just like you quit IVF.
There, you just did it again. [She smiles, humorlessly.] It's too bad. You would've made a great mother.
[whispers] I don't know.
[whispers] Good night.
So it's a bleed, clot, tumor, metabolic, or infection. Stick him in a CT.
I'm assuming he has a giant head.
Fun.
Anybody can hate humanity after getting shot. Takes a big man to hate it beforehand.
See? Perfectly reasonable explanation. She's definitely not here trying to work her way back on the team and steal your job or anything.
(taking a file from Cuddy) What's this?
Forget it.
There's a reason that we've evolved a feeling of awkwardness. It tells us not to talk about things.
You're welcome. Any time you want to stop kissing, I'm there for you.
I kinda hit that last night, so now she's all on my jock.
What part of olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole don't you understand?
The Formster and the Camster. Kickin' it old school. (to Taub) Thank God she's not trying to steal your job. (to the team) Go do it. And search the home for toxins.
Go away.
She's fine. Why would it take anyone more than a few hours to get over misplacing a baby?
Kinda hit that. So she's all on my jock.
(looking at Wilson) Huh. Everyone else thought I was kidding.
Got a chart laid out with all the bases. I'll take you through it.
What can I do? I'm going to ignore her for the rest of my life. This mosquito bite kept me awake.
So now I have two reasons to ignore her. (still scratching) It was just a kiss.
Yes. Those large things in her bra.
Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it within the phrase "I hit that."
Finally you said something useful. If I actually break the skin, it'll let the poison out.
Sorry. I get better reception when you're not here.
(into the phone) What do you got?
And since you're not breathing hard, I assume you're not holding Cameron aloft in triumph. Which means no seizures.
Hey, speaking of breathing hard, Cameron, you engaged to Chase yet?
After six years?
Sleep deprivation would take too long. You living together?
And cloud the diagnosis with side effects. His place or yours?
Interesting.
And no matter what the answer, it would've been interesting. No engagement. Commitment issues. His place, control issues. Not sure whose, but interesting.
Where was the patient when he had his first seizure?
Getting close to the outdoors, spooked him, raised his BP. Use that fear. Bring him outside.
Okay. So bring the outside to him.
Floors (tapping the floor with his cane), genuine wood.
They overheard me announce the half price bank foreclosure in the ER waiting room. Where's everybody?
Because they don't need to be here. Neither do you. And yet you are.
(to his tour group) This way.
Original? They were here before the house. (They enter Stewart’s bedroom) The shut-in's also original. Come on. Don't be shy.
Easy for you to say. You're not gonna be making some serious capital gains.
And leaving him undiagnosed is what, altruistic? Procedure worked. He's seizing. What do you see?
It's something.
See? It's something.
Blockage explains the pain. What explains the blockage plus seizures?
Wouldn't. Pain changes things.
He can chase me out once he's done doubling up in agony.
(to Stewart) Whatever your big problem is, it's caused a complication we call "colon FOS." "Fo," full of. Since we're in mixed company, "S" is stool. Nothing's coming out. So the pain's gonna get worse and worse. We need to stick a pooper scooper in you. We also need to take a look at your bowel.
Uh-huh, and if the crazy fairy were here, she could grant them.
Except now you're feeling pain inside.
And if it doesn't work? That blockage will rupture your intestines, spew sewage throughout your body. Whatever you're scared of out there, aren't you more scared of death?
If you don't mind floppy hair and an annoying accent, I know a surgeon who will operate in your home.
He's not gonna do surgery in some crazy dude's house.
What I said was that Chase would put him under at the house, we'd take him to the hospital, open him up, do our thing, then slip him back into his room for the post-op without him ever finding out that we tricked him. Some of that was implied.
He'll be asleep.
Why are you siding with him? (He puts his hand on his chin as if genuinely asking a question) Oh, yeah, you're that girl who likes broken people because her husband died. And since Chase isn’t all that broken —
I was risking my life to avoid becoming a cripple. He's doing it to avoid sunlight and fresh air.
Because she's right. I don't care where he gets the post-op, just that he gets it. Keep him here.
Yes. We don't need to talk.
(House looks down at his bandaged hand) That's weird. I usually don't get the stigmata until Easter.
He'll soon be on his way back. He's sick. He'll crash. He'll lose consciousness. (House continues to scratch his bug bite) I'll declare an emergency, bring him back in.
Bad lovin' gone bad.
Because ignoring her is a lot easier. Convince the patient to let us back in again. See if you can clear his blockage with lactulose. If this thing kills him before we can diagnose, it won't be fun anymore.
If the confederacy had mosquitoes, we'd all have southern accents and I'd be paying Foreman less.
You understand that different implies difference. She's tossed me a million times before.
How is that scary? It's rational. Emotionally mature people who work together should not date. Guaranteed breakup. Guaranteed ugliness.
Why does this matter so much to you? Cuddy and I are fine. The only person getting worked up here is you.
Are you familiar with the adverb "vicariously?”
You did ask her out. Last year. Whatever happened there?
Wrong. You were interested. But Amber grabbed your genitals first. But now you're single, and that makes you miserable because you think it's too soon for another relationship. So you're gonna make me miserable. Please, get a girlfriend, or a life, or something. For me.
Better or worse?
Well, then one of us wasn’t paying attention because I thought that surgery thing was just a trick.
We still need Trapper John.
I can't understand a word he says.
Taub. Doing anything later?
(to the lawyer) Hey, wanna see if your client's actually made of money?
(looking into the microscope) Mucosa's pink. Flattened villi.
Explains the seizure and the stomach pain.
Hey, wait. The gas —
(to the lawyer) That always happens during surgery. Just the gas build up in the blockage. Nothing to sue about. (to the team) Treat him for the burns. Put him on antibiotics for the Whipple’s. He'll be fine.
Not fast enough. Not accurate enough. (He stops tossing the ball) Force-feed him wheat then do an endoscopy as it hits his duodenum. See if there's an allergic reaction.
Foreman, listen to that little voice in your head that's coming from the telephone. (speaking directly into his cell phone on the desk) Force-feed him.
Hey, you remember that idea that Cameron had about trying to torture the patient into admitting himself?
Wow. Everyone's got all these great ideas today. (pause) So you're thinking patient won't leave because leaving causes pain, so we gotta make staying more painful. That actually makes sense.
He's on morphine now. Pretty soon he'll be on less-phine. 'Cause when you restock, you'll actually be giving Cameron IV bags of saline.
Same reason you did the surgery.
No. It was because your marriage is falling apart. When you confess adultery, things tend to go bad. When one part of your life does a Titanic, you make a life raft out of whatever's left, which makes your job more significant, which is why you did the surgery, why you pulled an all-nighter, and why you'll do this.
(looking back at Taub) Right. That's what we'll tell everyone.
(looking more curious than alarmed) Huh.
Buzzzzzzz.
Rick Ocasek would kill me if I — oh, you mean Cuddy.
Yeah. I came here to have you lecture me on Cuddy, not because there's a killer mosquito chasing me around my apartment.
Ah, she's bugging me. Poetic.
(pointing to his hand) Have you seen this bite?
I am not imagining things.
She's my boss.
I am not rationalizing. I'm better off alone. Also, you seen her ass recently?
Oh, come on.
At 3:00 in the morning? When do regular people sleep?
Is he in enough pain to come in yet?
Inconclusive.
I missed you. Endoscopy?
Well, then do it again.
No pulse. (pulling his phone from his pocket) Start CPR.
Pizza. You like anchovies? I'm calling the lawyer. (House tucks his phone under his chin and starts CPR) Genuine emergency. He'll okay admission.
Exactly. (to the lawyer) Hi. Sorry to wake you. Your introvert is having a heart attack.
(still talking to the lawyer) He can survive 15 minutes on oxygen and CPR. We can get him to the hospital in five. (to Cameron) Lawyer says yes. Continue CPR.
2123 Holden Green. Patient with PEA.
Wait!
Hey, Cameron, how would you like your old job back? I'm asking 'cause it’s the only way I can fire you.
We'd have seen it on the abdomen. It has to be a poison.
How clean?
(to Stewart) How often do you wash your tub?
Bleach and ammonia?
You know how kids play toy soldiers in the bath? He likes to re-enact the battle of Ypres three times a week with real gas.
Put him on parenteral steroids and sodium bicarbonate.
Well, maybe the poison hasn’t completely shot his heart. And you won't have to feel guilty for the rest of your life.
Clubbing. Good or bad?
Means we were too late with the treatment. Tell the lawyer he’s off the clock. We're done.
Call Taub. Tell him to pick up some morphine. (He sits up) There's no need for the patient to be in pain.
No. He's on saline.
I love you. When you reach puberty, give me — (House has his epiphany) His abdominal pain. That was on morphine?
I was right. He is being poisoned.
What's this density on his hip?
Think less boney.
Explains the constipation, the nerves, the seizures. Hold him down.
(to Stewart) You're not gonna feel a thing… Except excruciating pain.
The mugger used hollow points. They exploded and left fragments. Your doctors missed a couple hiding behind your hipbone. It's no biggie. Except years later, they started to dissolve, and then, biggie, you started to dissolve.
No. Lead wouldn't have started to disintegrate till years after.
He's lying.
About everything. About his life. He doesn't even think he's happy here. He's miserable.
Yeah? Well, then why did Taub find rose petals in your entry hallway? Struck me as a little weird. Thought it might be medically relevant. But it actually just told me that you were pathetic. The day you crashed in your entryway… Was your girlfriend’s birthday. (He picks up a framed photograph) You weren't there for the mail. You were trying to go lay flowers on her grave. (House holds up the photo, which is obviously a picture of Stewart and his girlfriend)
Yeah, he's got PTSD. Yeah, he's agoraphobic. He's also a coward. You want to change your life, do something. Don't believe your own rationalizations. Don't lock yourself up and pretend you're happy.
Don't wanna hear it.
Yeah. (He stops and pulls his Vicodin bottle from his pocket)
Whichever one means you almost had me convinced it was a good idea.
Nothing to say?
No, you don't. Or no, you don't don't?
Is this some kind of reverse — ?
Thank God some of those offshore sweat shop jobs are coming back to America. (He hangs his coat on the coatrack)
In a factory? Either an Olympic gymnast who busted her leg, a child star who blew all her sequel money on drugs, or she's just a lying runaway.
(preparing his coffee) On the one hand, Kutner’s right. Maybe she's a sweet young thing, not a screw-up lying through her teeth. On the two hand, a pregnancy test only takes five minutes, and we no longer kill rabbits. So in conclusion, shut up, do the tests. What else?
Didn't we just have this conversation? Kutner trusts her. Someone else doesn't. So, in conclusion, shut up. Check her home and work for toxins or drugs. Kutner and Foreman, do an echo. Find the extent of the heart damage.
Yes… But he'll be very lonely. So I have to ask why?
Good for your career. Great for your street cred. What's in it for me?
And if there's an emergency with Annie, should she wait until you finish grooming lab rats?
(definitively and dismissisvely) No. (Foreman does not move) Oh, do you want a reason? Clinical trials take time. Your time is my time. (Foreman walks out)
Would that be the echo that Foreman chose not to run with you after I dashed his new drug discovery dreams?
I know. No structural heart damage.
It's the heart.
Not all heart damage has to be structural. Drugs could have caused intermittent tachycardia. (He gets up)
Steroids could cause an irregular heartbeat, making her current one irregular-er-er. Foreman. Start her on beta-blockers. (Foreman looks angry) The rest of you, do anything that isn't starting her on beta-blockers.
(popping the Vicodin) Yeah, we do. Nice job, Foreman.
But your decision to stick it to the man clearly inspired Oliver Twist. (He picks up a water bottle from the table and takes a drink)
You treated her based on empathetic orphan syndrome, and almost killed her in the process.
So what causes lung issues and delirium? And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy?
Silent and unhappy is better than vocal and unhelpful. If you'd run the echo that you didn't run before giving her the beta-blockers that you didn't give her — If you'd listened to what Kutner just said, you'd know it's not a heart problem.
Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms, and run an fMRI to see which artery's dancing. And when I say Foreman, I mean… Foreman. I want his signature on the paperwork. I want videotape. (House moves toward his office and points to Foreman with his cane) I want photographs of him with the patient on today's newspaper.
Only relevant if it can cause pulmonary edema and delirium.
Is she a psych patient?
Thank goodness one of you doesn't have a heart. Maybe if we all stopped wringing our hands, we could solve this thing and let her live to have a few more nightmares.
(leaning forward in his chair and placing his cane across his lap) Yesterday, you were all BFF. Now you think she's pathological.
That's it.
Her whole life's a mess. What rhymes with mess?
Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs, and she's delirious. She's a picture of emotional health. Severe emotional stress can lead to asymmetric function of the midbrain. Explains the delirium. Interruption of the brain-heart coupling could cause pulmonary edema.
Yes. I agree. It does explain everything. Thirteen, load her up on diazepam. Foreman, make sure she does it. (House gets up) Thirteen, make sure he makes sure.
I went to Cuddy's house. But I didn't go in. Went home without ringing either her metaphorical or actual bell.
You're processing.
"Huh" means processing.
No insights? No opinions? (Wilson does not respond) You're disappointed.
Seriously? 'Cause last week you could. Last year you could. Seems to come pretty easy to you.
I want you to stop thinking that acting inscrutable makes you anything other than annoying.
(Calling loudly as Wilson leaves) Holding things in can give you cancer!
(standing, his cane across his shoulders, his back to the team) So what messes with her lungs, her mental status, and runs her blood through a wood chipper?
What does her furniture look like? (He turns to face the team) Said it was homemade. Old boxes, what?
The wood have little dents or holes?
Holes means that it was pressure-treated. Sawing or burning it releases arsenic into the air, into her lungs.
Because it found a cloak of invisibility hiding —
She was cured, then she wasn't.
Put the arsenic back.
Just because we call something a poison doesn't mean it's bad for you.
But since she's still dying, the arsenic obviously wasn't killing her. And since she's now getting worse, the arsenic was obviously fighting the killer. It's a hero. We should be organizing a parade. (He moves around to stand behind his desk)
So, put the arsenic back. (He pops a Vicodin)
Biopsy a lesion, confirm that she's dying, then load her up with arsenic. Keep her alive till you can convince her that rapist marrow and rapist-enabling marrow work just as well as the unleaded stuff.
This about the case you didn't want me to know about?
Foreman. (Foreman looks puzzled) You didn't flinch when you found out about a sixteen-year-old who could be dying in the next few days. Means you're here about someone even younger dying even faster.
(ignoring the file and brushing by Foreman) But he has you. (House heads out the door)
Pot calling a kettle a pot?
Wanted something all your own? Now you got it.
Your disengagement won't work.
You think that when you tell me what I should do, my instincts are to push back, so that by not telling me what you think I should do, I'll do what you think I should do.
Disengagement is neither artful nor effective.
Right.
No, you're not. You are designed to have opinions and to force them on people.
(interrupting loudly from his office) Trying to sleep here!
(picking up his backpack) Run the donor banks. I'm going home. (He slings the backpack over his shoulder)
(approaching the doorway) I assume she's already said no to that idea, or there'd be no need to screw up your courage before saying it.
Guess I'm the only one who cares about patient rights.
Our job is to find out what's killing patients, not treat them for chronic idiocy. (He turns back to his office)
(picking his coat up off the chair) And since we can't cure that, I’m going home. (He moves toward his office door)
(turning back and looking at Thirteen) Your point being?
So treat her.
So don't treat her.
So treat her.
It's my turn now, right?
Well, when you decide, get back to me.
Not scared enough. Tell her the thing about emotional reactions is they're definitionally irrational. Or stupid. Might wanna phrase that in your own words.
That's your rational explanation of her emotional response.
That makes sense. How long did it take her to come up with that?
That doesn't make sense.
Emotional is immediate. She went to rational first. Means there was no emotional to process.
Wouldn't be her first.
So… what's worse than rape?
Hi, I'm Dr. House. (He stands to face her at the bottom of her bed) What did you do?
Something happened, but it wasn't rape.
You're scared, and stubborn, and you don't like people feeling sorry for you. Why not?
But you know you're not. (He moves to the side of the bed until he is standing right over her) You need people to see how independent you are, how well you're coping. So they won't see the lost, hurt little girl. (He leans down and is now right in her face) Because that's not what you see. You see someone who did something terrible… Who deserves to suffer. Who doesn't deserve to live. (pause) What did you do?
Eventually, we'll find your parents… If only to deliver the body.
(frustrated) You're an idiot. You'd rather die than face your parents because, what, you broke their Faberge egg?
(quietly now) If you don't take your parents' bone marrow… You'll be killing their other child. If they don't hate you now, they will then.
Sure you do. You want someone to tell you it was just an accident. That it's not that bad, well, it is that bad. And you know it. There's nothing you can do to change that. (pause) But there is one thing you can do, to not make it worse.
If you're here to celebrate the kid's bone marrow transplant working, you missed cake.
Already had this conversation.
Okay.
Can I give my reasons later… or never?
Three days ago you asked me. Now you told me. (He grabs his backpack and cane and heads toward the office door) Can't say no if it's not a question.
He speaks.
I almost cost a four-year-old his life.
Did I? (He looks at Wilson)
I sound clever.
Your little game didn't work. I'm not Foreman, and you're not me.
Nope.
Good to know.
Well, she's either not here, or she's under the desk. Either way, you're gonna have to wait outside until I'm finished.
Yes, which is why I need you to get out and leave me alone. [He grabs a pack of Post-Its from the desktop.]
Nice try. Love to help.
[calmly] You wanted to see doctor —
[conversationally] What seems to be the problem?
[not moving and not looking away from the gun] No, we're not.
That's a bathroom you're barricading. It might come in handy, especially since you've cleverly decided to take a bunch of sick people hostage.
[standing, very slowly] You really think that reenacting "Dog Day Afternoon" is the best way to get diagnosed? I'm sure you've been waiting for hours in an uncomfortable chair, but you should watch the movie all the way through.
And all that was missing was the threat of violence. [He starts slowly approaching Jason.]
That's a cool constellation of symptoms. It could be something minor. At least compared to life in prison, which is what you seem to prefer to seeing 16 more specialists.
No need. Symptoms — those are the things you keep whining about. Tests — negative, or you wouldn't be here. History — shy, quiet kid. Kept to himself. Collected comic books and missing children.
Next time pack some heat, and maybe we'll look into it.
If you ask me, keeping an open line of communication is the best way to resolve conflict. [Jason puts the phone on the chair next to him.] What kind of breathing problems?
So you figured your wife left you because you couldn't breathe, right? Me, I rarely kidnap someone unless I've got a serious health problem. Since you're not almost dead, it means you're armed because you're blaming something other than your health on your health.
Oh. Got a match?
Because I'd rather not stand here while you try and negotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.
Stay out of the desk! Cuddy doesn't smoke. But he does. [gestures toward Mitch]
Right. You just brush your teeth with coffee grounds.
You figure that two people snuck weapons into the clinic today?
Hold it out as far as you can. Try to blow it out. [Jason wheezes as he blows. The Bic flickers but doesn’t go out. The second time, it doesn’t even flicker.] Decreased lung volume. Heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain. An intermittent rash — could be 100 things. If you add on that final symptom, it can only be pulmonary scleroderma.
Last one is the 16 doctors who missed it. Simple alkylating agent, case solved. See you on visitor's day.
Crime scene!
About to be. Assuming he's not lying. But he seems like a pretty straight arrow to me. [He winks broadly at Jason who pushes the speakerphone button. House speaks louder and hands the receiver to Jason.] I'm gonna need some propofol to prove that it's pulmonary scleroderma. Then we all get to go home.
Have one of the guards bring it in.
She might be armed. I'd have her deliver it shirtless.
Who is it?
Guys with even bigger guns?
Roll up your sleeve.
You're the only one who needs it.
Again, had your brilliant plan included a roomful of hostages that don't have fetuses, bacterial and fungal infections, leaving their immune systems too weak to deal with the metabolic strain, or are already on pain killers that have fatal interactions…
She's sick. [to Larry] You are a very large creep. Take off your shirt. [He injects Larry, who grunts.] Satisfied?
[to Jason] Roll up your sleeve.
I thought I had a little more time with a guy that size. [Jason primes the gun and points it at House.] You're not gonna do anything. You still need me.
What are you doing? He didn't do anything.
[to Jason] It's for you.
Joe's Bar and Grill.
[turning on the speakerphone and putting the phone on the desk] What causes low lung volume, heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain, insomnia, and a rash?
Dr. Robert Chase. On the off chance you have some brilliant escape plan and are the vengeful type.
Seriously? You're walking out?
[taking a picture off the wall and gesturing to Oliver] Throw me that marker, will you? [He does.]
[writing on Cuddy’s wall] Next!
First rule of triage: Guys with guns go first. Next!
It's not my wall. You're gonna get some special deliveries. Foreman, we're gonna draw blood. Run tests for infection and cancer. Cameron, comb through his medical records. See if any of his past 900 medications could have screwed up his heart. Taub and Kutner, go to his apartment, check for neurotoxins.
Giving out your address. Clearly you're not going back there. Means you do have an end game.
Got one lower limb flesh wound, another guy unconscious. Unfortunately, not the guy we hoped. We're gonna need someone to deliver his blood. [Jason disconnects the call.] It's gonna be hard to play doctor —
Interesting. Anybody else hear those guys outside? [pause] Anybody? He's got hyperacusis.
It means we have a favorite. It's nerve related.
Puff out your cheeks. Come on. [House demonstrates and Jason imitates him.] Now big mug shot smile.
Seventh nerve palsy. Plus intermittent rashes. Plus migraines. It's post-herpetic neuralgia.
I'm not judging here. This thing is just as likely to be caused by chicken pox.
There is a test. It's dangerous and painful while the treatment is safe and painless. But you make a good point. You need proof now. I'll order up the test. If you have neuralgia, you won't feel it going in.
Win-win.
Capsaicin. 200 micrograms.
First — don't use his name so much. It doesn't sound reassuring, it just sounds creepy. Second — come on, he's not gonna shoot the one person he trusts to bring in his medication. He's gonna shoot the hostages if she doesn't bring it in.
[talking through the cap of the syringe which is in his mouth] Anybody here got a long-standing case of neuralgia that's killed their nerves so this won't hurt at all?
You're looking to be the hero?
The guy's got a gun. I think that covers the parental consent issue.
You have to. It's the rules.
This is a level of risk taking beyond anonymous girl-on-girl action.
With a degenerative, drug-unfriendly illness.
This is a genetic flaw. This is your Huntington’s speaking. This is you waving a white flag at the world.
Wow! I would have laid money you had herpes. [to Jason] Your turn. So why are we here? We've ruled out immediate risk of death, lost love. That just leaves… work? You're defined by your work. But you kept seeing doctors, kept missing time. Couldn't focus. [injects him] Maybe you made a huge mistake… got fired.
I know. I'm asking why.
So either his heart's on the fritz, or he's got cancer.
Or she's just ugly.
You can't be sure what —
I am going to try to strangle you faster than you can pull a trigger.
It's racing. 160.
Shut up! All of you. [He listens to Jason’s heart with the stethoscope then removes it and reaches for Jason’s neck again.]
Carotid massage… gotta slow your heart. It's 200.
Uh-uh. Whole point of those things is to make your muscles contract. They don't discriminate against trigger fingers.
[equally loud] Don't!
Threatening to shoot the guy who's diagnosing you makes a lot of sense. Actually doing it, not so much.
If we don't know what kind of heart rhythm it is —
If she doesn't come back, you've got plenty of other people you can shoot.
She's gonna go.
She should go.
But not her.
If you don't think your life is worth more than someone else's, sign your donor card and kill yourself.
Adenosine slows the heart. Which is fine, if it's beating fast like yours. Not fine if it's normal, like hers. Following the math on this?
The martyr's heart is beating dangerously slow. Are we good to go? [He injects Jason while Regina tends to Thirteen.] [House feels for Jason’s pulse.] Your heart's back to normal. No tachycardia. No sign of a heart defect at all. [pause] But you're sweating.
On one side of your face, but not the other.
A tumor is pressing on your sympathetic nerves. You have lung cancer.
So's her IQ. Help her up. Get her heart going faster. [He looks at Oliver who goes over to help.]
Of course you do!
It's gotta be a Pancoast tumor. Patient's got dyspnea, seventh-nerve palsy. He's sweating on one side of his face.
Take your time. It's not like I've got a gun to my head.
[to Jason] Spit on the floor.
If I do it, I can't tell Cuddy that it was medically necessary. I'm gonna ask you to piss on her chair next. [Jason tries to spit. Nothing comes out. He coughs.] Dry mouth. His parotid glands aren't working.
Feel that. Right there.
You just did it.
Good idea. Oh, damn. I left my CT machine in my other pants.
So… what made you snap? HMOs?
Nah, you saw 16 doctors. How bad could they have been?
Humiliation? Doctors treating you like a piece of meat? Too many fingers and tubes up your holes. You hate doctors. You want to take back control. If so, I apologize for the fact that you are a piece of meat.
That's not all. Curiosity's not enough. There's gotta be a deeper reason.
Never shot anyone.
Yeah.
What's this?
[to Oliver] Show him.
Now, unless you think we pre-arranged that, just in case we were ever held hostage by a guy who needs a CT, we're not lying. So you have two choices. You can give me the gun and get your answer. Or you can shoot me.
[looking back at Oliver] Why are you still here?
There isn't one. I don't know what you have.
He overpowered me and got the gun back. [He hangs up.]
I'm arrogant. You're the coward. You're terrified of death. You just want to cheat it by making it come sooner. Gives you the illusion of control.
Sorry. We might need you. [The phone starts ringing again. House picks it up and slams down the receiver.] How do they expect me to think?
He's quick for a sick guy. Dyspnea, anemia, seventh-nerve palsy, tachycardia. [He puts his cell phone on speaker and drops it on the counter.] Long passes. Anything. Go.
You ever been to Cameroon or on the Ogowe River? Next.
[getting up and approaching Jason] Whoa, whoa, whoa… We have a new symptom. He is turning his head, favoring his left ear. Means he's partially deaf in the right.
We'll keep that between us till you talk to your lawyer. [He picks up the wall phone and pushes the intercom and speakerphone buttons. He speaks to Bowman] I need dexamethasone and enough time to provoke a respiratory reaction and confirm Cushing’s syndrome.
If you have Cushing’s, this will slow your breathing.
Those were not the terms.
Why would I do that? I gave you back the gun!
She has Huntington’s. If these drugs are real, it could screw up her liver.
Don't do —
Killing her is your chance to get personal?
If she were clinging to hope, she wouldn't be standing in line waiting for you to order up more drugs. [He puts on a stethoscope and goes to Jason.] Take a deep breath.
[removing the stethoscope] I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker. [He goes to Thirteen and feels for her pulse.] Heart's racing. Fever. [He lays her down on the CT bed and turns to Jason.] And your breathing's unchanged.
Means I was wrong. Her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.
We have to get her out of here. [He opens his cell phone.] The dexamethasone is making Thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the patient's — why?
[to Jason] I need to slap you. For diagnostic purposes. [Jason points the gun at him.] Seriously. If I was jerking you around, I'd say I needed to kick you in the groin. [Jason lowers the gun and House slaps him across the face.] That twitch is Chvostek's sign. Don't ask me how Chvostek discovered it. [into the phone] He has calcium deficiency. Drugs that block calcium tend to shield against kidney damage.
Those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years. He has something that has a long incubation period. Something that should have wrecked his kidneys. Something that explains breathing problems, heart problems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood.
Would make perfect sense if our patient was an Arabian Bedouin.
Except that if you read the history, you'd know that our patient has never been to a tropical climate!
You idiot.
Well, not to the Supreme Court. But it's warm enough for germs. [He closes his cell phone and walks over to the wall phone.] You keep blaming doctors when you can't even give a halfway decent history.
It will be as soon as you get us three grams of ceftazidime.
[disconnecting the call] Why are you getting rid of me?
You're gonna give her the meds.
Come on, give 'em to me instead.
[angrily]Her kidneys are failing. You give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you.
Your obsession is gonna kill her!
[calmer now] It is pointless to give her those drugs. Even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis.
Shut up. I'm not leaving.
Why are you still alive?
Test confirmed melioidosis. Easy to miss on a stain. [He retrieves his cane.] Scans and X-rays vary widely.
If he hadn't done what he did, he'd be dead. Good thing you enabled my every medical move. [He moves to stand closer to her.]
I don't know. Let's try it again without me.
If you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship with me, I don't know how I can help you. 'Cause the only change you can make from a non-relationship is…
God, no. Just trying to follow your logic.
Democrats' health care plan?
No point. I'm in an elevator. Can't run away.
That's just mean. [They get off the elevator and walk down the hall side by side.] Why are we still together?
Pronoun confusion. Starts kicking in once you pass child-bearing age.
I think the patient holding the gun to my head was actually the one directly responsible.
Where's Foreman and Thirteen?
Other than throwing off the feng shui with her ass that faces all eight sides of the bagua at once?
I'm well aware. [to Kutner and Taub] Normal CT means that her lung problem has the distinction of having nothing to do with her lungs.
[looking at the picture] Wow. Muscles and curves. My penis is so confused.
And you actually believe what you see on TV. Go run the labs.
Can someone please stop backseat differentialating?
Nice try. Except EIA doesn't account for the elevated BP, if you'd read the file. [to Taub and Kutner] Come on. Before the shrieking harpy melts my brain.
I know.
I know. You know. She can't know.
Get creative. [He fakes giving Taub Emmy’s photo. When he reaches for it, House gives it to Kutner.]
You wanna work in here? Fine. Me too. We'll split the desk, 50-50. That side's yours. This side's mine.
So that's your strategy. Taking the high road. It's not gonna work.
Well, she's consistent. The lung problems had nothing to do with her lungs. A heart problem that has nothing to do with her heart. Something is strangling her system.
Find it, cut it out.
Subtle. No way you geniuses could've spotted this.
I could, but that would defeat the purpose of doing it here. Where are the smart guys?
I said yes to this?
Forget the bypass. Treat her like a fat girl.
Not on the outside. But on the inside, she's still tons of fun.
Ten points for doing what I said. Minus ten points for doing it badly. If this was diabetes-induced nerve damage, it would've kicked in years ago. [Turns to his desk. Cuddy is still on the phone. Loudly] Have you seen my balls?
My balls. Have you seen my balls? Giant one and the red one.
Of course it is. I try to make you miserable to make you leave. You deny that it's making you miserable. You try to make me miserable so I’ll stop making you miserable. And eventually you will leave, citing reasons that have nothing to do with misery.
Step one complete.
Apnea would've disappeared when she shrank.
She been snoring?
Did she mention feeling tired after a full night's sleep?
[staring at the photo] This isn't apnea. And this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.
Cliff notes. Gastric bypass only makes her skinny on the outside. On the inside, we have heart and lung issues not caused by heart and lung issues.
Let the dying girl finish.
Tssss. Dr. Thirteen has the floor.
Very stupid. Her potassium's fine.
Very not stupid. Bacteria in the bowels means there's bacteria in the poop. Get some and test it.
But her wrong idea led to his right one. It was vital screwing.
[standing behind them, unnoticed] What happened? He call Foreman "clean and articulate" again? It is surprising.
What's the poop?
What are we looking for?
I'm doing my famous Socrates impression. Think I really nailed the accent.
And what does fat do in water? [He’s at the sink with the tap turned on.]
What else floats in water?
Looks like I was wrong to dismiss apnea. You guys can stay up all night gloating in the sleep lab. [He drops the glove on the bucket and leaves.]
How did she manage to sneak out for a run?
You two get the results of the sleep apnea test, or did those need to use the bathroom too?
Cunning plan. You do realize it’s gonna stink for hours — on both sides.
Or both.
Way to know where your bread is buttered, sister. [raising his hand for a high five] Up high!
Or a million other things. We're gonna stay in the dark until we can figure out if her electrical problem is in her power station or in the high-tension wires. [They stare at him.] Power station's the brain. Wires are the nerves. Go run an NCV test.
I had the weirdest dream. You guys did the test in a reasonable amount of time and came back here before I had time to fall asleep. [winces] You guys still smell that?
Or… [Sean Connery imitation] She sends one of yours to the hospital, send one of hers to the morgue. It's not myasthenia gravis. Her breathing's improving and the weakness is in her extremities.
All that is needed for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing. [He hands Taub his cane and picks up a sledge hammer.]
True. [He limps into the bathroom.] Could also be any kind of heavy metal toxicity. PSP or arsenic from eating too much seafood. Cadmium from bad bottled water. Lead or nickel from canned fruits or natural grains.
It is now. Lucky for us, we can treat all those toxins with the same thing: chelation.
That rules out toxins. So what else can go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?
Obviously because it would be stupid to do this in an office with no furniture. Cuddy… overreacted to my overreaction.
This started in the lungs, not the heart. And why are you leaning on a 45-degree angle away from Foreman?
Trouble in the land of false hope?
Nice deflection. But our patient doesn't drink. She's a health nut. And even if I was a cynical guy and thought that she was a liar, I'd have done a tox screen, which would've come back negative for alcohol. You should come to these gatherings more often. Keep you from looking like an idiot. [Kutner’s beeper goes off.] Are you making book, or did something else happen to our patient?
So who's paging you? Your wife? Does it worry you that she paged Kutner first?
Gastric bypass probably set it off. Oh, at what price beauty? Go start her on plasmapheresis.
Took three visits, but I finally convinced the contractor that I’m Cuddy's boss. And all the office renovation plans need to go through me.
[marking an area on the blueprint] See there? I'm having a bidet put in instead of a toilet. Not in addition to. Instead of. You want to know what happened to the old toilet?
I smashed it with a sledgehammer.
Is this fun for you? Analyzing everyone else's fun away?
Where are you going?
Does Foreman schedule your appointments by numbers on the clock or just by when I’m in the middle of something?
[calling after her] So losing the 200 pounds was just a coincidence? [He gets up.]
If her brain is slowly turning into a Swiss cheese, there's not a lot we can do.
Get a brain biopsy to confirm.
That is the test.
You're obviously not opposed to being invasive.
I hereby declare them ruled out.
[following her] Start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not. [Taub and Kutner get up.]
You're not stopping me for medical reasons. You're stopping me… because you have the hots for me.
Evidenced by the fact that I’m the one who moved into your office.
Why are you dressed like that? Why do you try so hard to get my attention? Are you screwing with me?
That depends on your answer.
We already did that. [He puts his hand on her breast.] It seemed like the logical next step.
Can you leave these?
I know.
When you were philandering with impunity, how did that feel?
You weren't miserable. You gave something away to make a relationship work. You rationalize that you're getting something back.
Leave 'em there. I'm gonna do the biopsy myself. [He leaves.]
Cuddy doesn't always get what she wants.
You're fired. Just reinforcing your point.
Thought you said she was sick.
Sick people don't spontaneously get better.
Sick people who are sick enough to make it to me don't spontaneously get better. Not as pithy, but yeah, technically more accurate. What's the last thing you gave her?
MRIs detect. They don't treat. What did you give her after the MRI?
You gave her cake.
You figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me. [He leaves. Taub follows.]
Feeling crappy again? I brought your cure. [He pulls off the lid of the cake container and gives it to Taub. There’s a whole, chocolate-frosted, two-layer cake inside.] I'd give you an IV of this stuff, but the frosting tends to get stuck in the little tubes.
It's not a joke. Not a lie. Not an attempt to defraud in any way. It's an actual licensed physician with an actual diagnosis. Hereditary coproporphyria. [He brings a forkful to her and she turns her head away.] Your face is genetically blessed. Your body chemistry is slightly less so. [He eats the cake.] Doesn't make enough of a certain enzyme that I can't pronounce, but it's apparently important for your liver and everything else. Treatment is a high carb diet rich in sugar. When you were a porker, you were self-medicating.
The best you you could be is a lot more you. [He brings another forkful of cake to her.] Open the hangar. Here comes the plane.
Understand. There's not many people who have the guts to admit they'd rather be pretty than healthy. The income's better and you get more action. I'll start you on your drug treatment right away. [He leaves.]
Slowly. [They turn. He’s standing behind them.] And painfully. You're not only idiots, you're frauds. Fraudulent idiots. Fraudulent idiotic killers, as it turns out.
Your fault? Yeah! For pretending to be me when you're not even competent. [He throws a file at Kutner.] And your fault for not ratting him out while the patient was still alive. What she had was easily treatable. She could've been fine. Damn treatment's so simple. [He stares at her.] Might still be possible.
She wasn't dead. She wasn't even sick, you moron. [DeeDee raises her hand and House gives her a high five.] Seriously, how good was she? No formal training. At least not in acting.
I think we may have an anal hygiene violation there.
That was from a patient three years ago. It was hard to find. But the hair and make-up, getting Chase and Cameron to play along, much easier.
Take it down? Are you kidding? It's way too lucrative to shut it down. For Chase, for me. I earn 50% for letting you use my name. Chop chop. Go to work. First dollars go to expenses. I booked our little thespian here for two full days. That's three G's I owe her.
Do I?
Why have Foreman’s breasts suddenly started to droop?
When are you taking vacation? [He raises his eyebrows suggestively.]
So I understand Foreman’s absence. Your presence, not so much.
I’ve noticed you a lot recently. It’s almost as if you have a sexual interest in someone here. Like, say… Taub.
That’s funny. Usually explodes after I do that.
Twice. [He grabs it and puts it back in the trash] Someone’s screwing with me. Forget it.
I said, forget the book! [The fellows look at each other] Why’d they pick on her?
I’m assuming literally. Depending on where this school falls on the Healthers scale…
When do teachers never know how to motivate their students?
And you, standing there, beseechingly.
[to Cuddy] Convenient.
Theories!
No. Infections?
[angrily] I told you to lay off the present. [The fellows smile behind his back.] and the LSD. We got distracted by the painkillers. Toxins are still the most likely.
You talked to Wilson.
I knew I should have just wrapped a new present. You said the patient volunteered. Where?
Soup kitchen in Trenton. Thirteen, Kutner — go search the home and the school. Taub, you take the anal swabbing of the fragrant and contagious homeless men. [Taub stops smiling as the fellows leave.]
Why don’t you just hang out in the video store and tell everyone Kevin Spacey’s Keyser Soze? [He grabs the ice cream] By the way, that ending really made no sense at all.
I had no way of knowing there was an expensive book inside.
Stealing your ice cream is a completely meaningless, albeit delicious prank. Observing my team’s reactions to unexplained phenomena could’ve been pretty useful.
Have you checked the prices for firemen strippers recently?
You really passed your psych rotation?
If I wanted gifts, I would just look deep into my patient’s eyes and act like you. “Oh, I’m so sorry you’re dying, Mrs. Moron. Of course I’ll sleep with you. What I lack in skill, I can make up for in…”
Right, because I’m physically incapable of being polite.
Oh, I get it. You’re trying to get me to prove you wrong. Then I’m gonna be nice to all my patients all through the holiday season and then Mr. Potter won’t steal Tiny Tim’s porridge. I’m totally on it.
[thoughtfully] You’re right. I gotta stop being such a jerk. [Wilson looks at him. He takes Wilson’s second ice cream sandwich.] Oops. Kinda undercut myself there. [He leaves]
You got that from an anal swab? Man, you’re good.
[removing his jacket and swiping a lab coat from a chair back] Unless you can tie him to the patient…
I hate spunk.
Start her on the standard regimen. [He heads for an exam room]
Who says it’s a duty?
Hi. I’m Greg.
Hi, Whitney. How can I help you? [He limps to a stool and sits.]
Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. I’ll get you fixed up. Is there anything else you need like a bottle of water? Coffee? Mint tea?
If you can’t be nice, why be a doctor. So, where do you feel the pain?
Uh, huh. It’s Beccaria’s sign. That’ll be gone by your third trimester.
[deep breath] Neither is your fetus.
You didn’t know that you were pregnant?
How do I know? I missed my period. I got fat, threw up. Oh no, wait. That’s how you know.
I know because of the tight shirt stretched over the swollen boobs, the salt craving you imported into the clinic, [gestures at the almost empty bag of chips next to her] the motion sickness patch that doesn’t do anything for the kind of sickness that you feel in the morning.
I believe him.
Absolutely. There would need to be a guy sitting between you and the toilet seat. But yes, absolutely. [She looks at him imploringly. He rolls his eyes] I was doing so well.
Liver, lungs and now, brain. Which has mysteriously reappeared. [The word “brain” had been crossed out on the white board. He puts a check mark over it.] Speaking of mysteriously reappeared… [He puts a check mark over the crossed out word “Cuddy.”]
You keep showing up. You also keep leaving. It’s possible that you have the hots for me but really, really hate this kid. It’s also remotely possible that I have that reversed.
Does she remind you of… you? No. You weren’t a loser in high school. You had every Tom, Dick and Herschel wet dreaming about you. But she could be making you think of another helpless, chubby little girl you recently met.
Been a few weeks. Just enough time to get over hurt feelings…
Unless it also gave her a fungal infection. Give her a prick test and antifungals.
[takes a deep breath and adjusts neck] I said those words but with a particular inflection. [He turns back to the desk]
There was a reported case of a Civil War soldier who was shot in the testicles and the… musket ball carried the… non-musket ball into the uterus of a woman working in a neighboring field. Nine months later, a miracle child was born. [to Geoff] Also, maybe she cheated on you.
More likely, it came from the guy whose penis made it up there somehow but sure, anything’s possible.
[sotto voce] Tell him that amnios are dangerous this early on in the pregnancy.
Who cares? He doesn’t know.
Well, sometimes doctors make mistakes, [looks at the chart] Anna. We need to try twice as hard to fix them. You using your inhaler?
You sure you’re using it right?
No. Why don’t you show me how your inhaler works?
Jamaican chicken recipes.
So she’s willing to die to cover up some boozing.
[throws up his hands] I have no idea why you care so much. Tell Kutner to start her on benzos.
Uh, uh, uh. Not the alcoholism. Seizures. Totally different. [over his shoulder as he walks away] Don’t need their approval for that.
You sure you want to know? If it makes it any easier, I’m going to tell you anyway
[holds up his hand] Don’t leave.
No. [Geoff takes his hand off Whitney’s shoulder] But, she also didn’t cheat on you.
Gotta tell you about this clinic patient.
Alcohol withdrawal would cause her heart to race, not crawl.
It’s hitting all her organs. Could be the blood. What’s her alk phos?
And do a bone marrow to confirm.
Why are you so attached to this girl? [Cuddy opens her mouth but nothing comes out.] It’s your call. [He leaves]
We went over this. Normal complement level. [He shakes his head slightly]
You run a hospital that treats thousands of patients every day. Some of them die. Every day. If you're gonna get this worked up over every one of them… [He sorts through the pile Cuddy put on his desk while he speaks. He reaches a gift-wrapped box and grabs it and his cane] Yes! BRB
Thank you from a patient.
I saved her marriage by showing that her pregnancy was the result of parthenogenesis.
Yep. It's unbelievable. But I personally checked it five times.
Oh, yeah. That does sound impossible, now that I think of it. I guess the better explanation is that the paternity test showed she cheated so I faked the whole parthenogenesis thingy. [He opens Wilson’s door.]
I win. [He tosses the gift to Wilson who catches it.]
Mmm, more an argument. I realize it would have been simpler to just fake the paternity test, but hey — Christmas spirit and all that.
And it obviously would have been more fitting if the baby had been born on Christmas, not just invented then.
Which means we don't have one dead patient. We have two.
What's gonna happen to her?
What are you gonna do?
Merry Christmas, Cuddy. [He leaves]
Either I need a new watch, or Mowgli is cutting into your Beauty Sleep.
Proving that you're a better foster mom than a homeless drug addict.
I’m gonna need an extension. Got some time next decade.
That’s nice of her. Two questions — Why did she? And why are you telling me?
I’m gonna need an extension. I got some time —-
And I’ve got a w-h-o-r-e visit on —-
This is the favor? I was expecting something involving whipped cream and tongue depressors.
Oh, I am fascinated already. It’s like I’m treating myself. He gets cured, and I get to learn a valuable lesson about the milk of human kindness.
So you're wasting a favor because?
[rattling his Vicodin vial] Drug-seeking patients —
[who has continued to stare at the pills without taking them] It means they're idiots. It means we got to start from the beginning. [to Taub] We’ll do a pain profile to rule out psychosomatic pain. [to Thirteen] Search the home. [to Cameron] Go home. [to Kutner, tossing him the empty bottle] Get a refill… And a doughnut.
He’s not in pain because he's depressed. He’s depressed because he's in pain.
We’re not diagnosing his family.
It’s rhabdo. Push IV fluids, check his urine, do a muscle biopsy.
Then she'll biopsy all over.
[taking his jacket from the coat tree] If Cuddy can come in late, I can leave early. If you need anything while I’m gone, just ask Cameron to do it.
Got to let the phone ring more than four times when you're calling a cripple. Chronic pain and pulmonary embolism, go.
You called after midnight. It’s got to a heart problem. Heart only would be consistent with rhabdo, which means Thirteen and Foreman would be singing in the rain, which means it has to be lungs as well.
You think the blood clot was caused by a clotting problem. That’s helpful.
And why he's gone three years without anyone seeing it. Check his chest, abdomen, and pelvis for tumors. [He hangs up.]
No hurry. I already bathed once this week. I wouldn't want to look elitist.
Fine. Pad it all you want. Here’s a check for the deductible. Don’t touch the piano and lock up when you leave.
Well, I’m no architect, but I’m pretty sure the master bedroom is part of the home, which means the home warranty —
Yeah, 'cause I’m clearly a guy who likes to knock out a few naked pull-ups before I greet the day.
I’m about to hang a plumber in there.
So…
Good thing we don't have a suicidal patient with a horrific, undiagnosed pain disorder.
If it was vascular, we would've seen uneven pulses.
He had hemorrhages in his fingers.
[thinking] Yes, it does. [He leaves.]
It will be completely ineffective, and the pain will completely go away. Cancel the angio.
[handing Thirteen his cane] Where can air come from? Hmmm. [He inspects the IV line, started at Jeff and moving toward the IV stand.] Air can either come from a breach in the lumen in the small intestine, or in rare instances, air can come from the air. [He opens a connector in the line and shows it to hem.] Teeth marks. I’m guessing from when he blew into his IV tube.
You tried to finish the job that you started at home.
No. [He leaves.]
Are there any visuals in this room that are key to us learning our lesson? 'Cause the telephone —
Scent of a man! I realize you haven't experienced it sober.
He’s had multiple EEGs, all of them cleaner and squeakier than Cuddy's rubber nipples.
Fourteen is right. [Kutner smirks.] Go run an ischemic forearm test.
If you want a man to take your crap, you have to marry him first.
I need the name of a good lawyer.
Probably. That’s Cuddy's problem.
Except the pain's in two places that connect to two separate regions of the brain. Which means you're not using yours. Come on, you're from one of the 12 tribes. You know must know a ton of shysters.
Didn’t say I needed a lawyer. I said I needed the name of a lawyer.
Were consistent with a completely spotless MRI. [to Kutner] Who represented the hospital when you set that patient on fire?
Chris? That doesn't sound like a very good lawyer.
What was the name of the firm?
Need to cut off a guy's head. [Cuddy turns to leave.] Got to figure out if his pain's coming from his brain or his body. [She pauses at the door.] A stiff shot of lidocaine below the brain stem should numb him all the way down to his tippy toes.
I’m inconveniencing you because you inconvenienced me.
If they weren't, there'd be no inconvenience.
I’m forcing you to do your job! If you can't also —
If the pain stays, it's in his brain. If it vanishes —
You need to scratch option five. He’s already there.
If I don't diagnose him, there's a one-in-one chance he'll kill himself.
Just stretching my leg. Carry on.
[rattling pill bottle] About to get better. Don’t worry. He’s making yours a double.
Turns out you have to live to find out.
Left them all back on Krypton.
[quietly after a pause] Yes. [Chase looks at House for a moment.]
Can’t be. If whatever is causing the pain is in your brain, it's still a ten. Periphery is zero.
The big black guy.
[to Foreman as he inspects the envelope without opening it] Can you blame me? The last time that happened, the guy shot me.
Guy’s taken the finest opiates Blue Cross can buy. How come they didn't trigger a placebo effect?
I think he's faking.
Where is it?
[producing an empty bottle of rubbing alcohol from under the sheets.] His idiot son distracted the orderlies so that daddy death wish here could down a bottle of isopropyl. Get him on dialysis, or in half an hour, he'll be a corpse.
Remember the feeling. Maybe next time you want to help pops, you'll do a better acting job.
No angiokeratomata.
All the syph tests were negative. [They silently follow him into the Diagnostics Conference Room.] Why aren't you guys still talking?
Unless… Nothing does.
Mine’s a more interesting version of nothing. It used to be something. We can't find anything because whatever injury caused the original pain healed a long time ago. The only thing left is the drugs.
Pain and the drugs that treat pain work by changing brain chemistry, sometimes to the point where pain receptors read painkillers as killer pain. Take him off the drugs.
Torture is the cure. Eventually his body will recalibrate itself.
Yes. I find it confusing to assume otherwise.
Good thing I’m not the patient.
It’s the only hunch we've got. If I really wanted to torture him, I’d manipulate a clinical trial in the hopes that he'd sleep with you.
I think you got her in because of your usual Messiah complex. I think you messed with the appointment schedule because of your "I like to have sex" complex. I checked the logs. You moved your most promising patient right before her. False hope being quite the aphrodisiac.
Well, if it were that promising, you wouldn't have to change the schedule. But, hey… Hope springs eternal.
First time making cherries jubilee.
If you ask me, some of the portions in that recipe were off. [He picks up his insurance policy, which happens to be on the counter and leafs through it.] Sure hope it happens to be covered under, say, section three, subsection 2.2, paragraph one, accidental fire damage, in which case you'd have to replace the entire waterline to fix the sagging pipe.
I know. I started him back on the pain meds… [He drops his backpack behind his desk. She’s still standing there.] Which means you can leave.
Until we get an answer, it's the only way.
There's always an answer.
[quietly] Okay.
Because I have principles?
I don't care if I pay, as long as the people who pocketed my premiums for the last nine years also pay. I didn't break the pipe.
Nope, but I’m right.
Lock up on your way out. And don't touch the piano.
Testicles. What do they make you think of?
Oh, so close. The correct answer is epilepsy.
It does if it spreads to the sensory region of the brain, then rewires the pain neurons.
Not if the seizures are in a place you can't see on an EEG, a place too deep in the brain, like the area that controls the muscles supporting the…
Feels like you got kicked in the nads, doesn't it? [Jeff and Lynne look at him, puzzled.] The abdominal pain, how it all started. It wasn't the stomach. It was lower, right?
But when it first started.
Yeah, like bad gas, or a permeating pain… Like your kidneys were being pulled out through your scrotum.
Because epilepsy is treatable.
Nice of you to offer. Now I can actually get some cream cheese.
Love what you're wearing. Brings out the blue of the case file, which means it's not from the ER. So why are you here? [He tears open a packet of cream cheese with his teeth.]
Interesting. You have your whole life ahead of you. So why would Cuddy want you to die so young?
Good. Fun. You get to exercise your newfound power. I squirm under your thumb, resent the student becoming the teacher, and then push comes to shove, and we all get to realize what our real roles should be. Then you put out. [He takes a bite of his bagel.]
29-year-old Special Ed Teacher coughs up blood all over Corky. No dyspnea, no weight loss. [to Foreman] Why are you smirking?
I am going to do my job. If that involves leaving her a rotting pulp…
Oh, will you two stop it already?
Disagreeing.
It's not an opinion. It's a smoke screen. Toss out a lame idea, instead of agreeing with Foreman's better idea because you're worried that'll confirm that he's boldly gone where no man has gone before.
It's extremely relevant. Apparently, it colors everything. Now I have no idea if you have differing opinions because you have differing opinions or because you're just trying to prove that you can think for yourselves.
Oh, you don't want me to do that. Go run a bleeding-time test, confirm our patient's blood is screwy, then you can come back and pretend to disagree about why.
So now you're agreeing? Either you folded because I gave you crap, or you broke up, or —
Yes. Don't you?
Not with normal LDH.
Absolutely, and total body irradiation.
Don't forget, stop her from bleeding into her brain.
True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible. [He gets in the elevator.] Nobody can stop me from being premature. [He chortles goofily as the doors close on him.]
Got a patient with ITP. Need to hit her with radiation.
Good point. On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own.
Really?
Hmmm. Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory.
Nobody. Just because I call him nobody doesn't make me a racist.
I need oral sex. I'm pretty sure biological imperative qualifies as medical sense.
I don't really see how that's gonna be possible.
You have a medical dilemma for me. I have one for you. I need a reason to not do total body irradiation.
She said I can.
Because it's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.
Because that would let Cameron in on the fact that I never intended to do it.
I figured I'd ask for something really crazy, so she'd shoot me down and get the whole "I can control House" thing out of her perky little system. So the next time I went back and asked for something marginally crazy, it would seem marginally reasonable, and she'd say yes. So, yeah, slightly convoluted.
Go. Do. Don't flip.
Trust me. In the long term, this'll help all our patients. In the short term, double the dose of methotrexate and add prednisone.
Who has to go pee in the middle of a nuclear procedure?
She didn't know that. [The others look at him.] People don't die from peeing.
Oh, for God's sake, get a room. Immerse her in an ice bath. The cold will activate her cold agglutinins.
Confirming our diagnosis.
Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired maiden who loves to say yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. Looks like you guys are in the middle of a conversation. I can wait till Cuddy leaves. [He makes himself comfortable in an armchair.] You are gonna leave soon, aren't you? I mean, the nurses have got your baby out there. Not that they're gonna kidnap it or anything, but I figured that the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to listen to all the cooing.
Unless the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to dump the baby, because she hates the baby and thinks she made a big mistake. [Long pause as Cuddy and Cameron stare at House.] You can't trust that Wilson guy with anything.
Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?
He was worried, made a bad choice. It's not a big deal. I know it seems like crap, you probably feel like crap, but it's not. Legally, you haven't adopted her yet. There's no obligations, no strings. It can be undone tomorrow. Emotionally, you'll feel guilty for a while, but the kid… She won't even know you existed.
Much better than having a mother who doesn't give a crap.
We got a green light. Go draw the patient's blood.
To see if it clumps in the cold.
She approved the bath. Just thought we ought to do a test to confirm.
[getting on the elevator] Go draw the blood.
Only the ones that might involve stopping the patient's heart.
Shut up.
Please tell her that talking will ruin the test.
How much longer till the heart attack?
Now they're both talking.
I'm not surprised. She obviously has brain damage. [Taub looks at him.] Seriously.
Transposed digits. Classic marker for number confusion. Means she has a lesion in her left parahippocampal region.
She also forgot to pee before your fake test.
Shows an inability to predict the future.
Means the damage is ongoing.
I'm compelled.
I never said her deranged personality was a symptom.
Can you hear me now?
I did.
Or multiple sclerosis. The brain is like the Internet, packets of information constantly flowing from one area to another. Plaques in her brain are like a bad server, slow down the flow. If it's in the parahippocampus, it'll spread to the brain stem, which means it'll be the lungs next. Brain biopsy will show you the plaques.
Well, we could settle this with rock, paper, scissors, but, unfortunately, there are people who adjudicate these disputes.
Not this week, not next week, not next month.
The heart attack was six hours ago. Now, maybe it's planning to go into hiding for a couple years, or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs.
I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.
You want me to do another test?
No. You wanna say yes. You know you should say yes. But you also think that this job is about standing up to me. So you're not gonna say yes. You're not gonna say no. You're just gonna waste time. And the patient's brain, or pancreas, or whatever is wrong with her is not gonna wait for you to impress your boss. So pick one, either him or me.
This is surprising.
Go ahead with the ERCP.
Who?
What did you call her?
And you want to change that. I'm the last person you'd ever come to for ethical advice, literally, which means you've already asked every other person, and no one's given you the answer you want.
Has she invited any of her lesbian friends into bed with you?
Drug gonna cure her?
No cure then. So, the pros are you might delay the onset of symptoms, give her an extra year, maybe three. She's still dead before you're 45. The question is, are those few years worth risking the rest of your life in medicine?
There, that wasn't so hard, was it?
You're welcome. [Foreman turns to leave again.] Unless you love her. [Foreman turns and stares at House.] If you love her, then you do stupid things.
Lung failure proves that one of us was right. Who said “brain”?
I was right about the where, but not the what. A picornavirus could cause localized demyelination that the MRI wouldn't pick up. If we run a nerve-conduction study on the surface of her brain we'll see the dead spots.
Actually, I'm talking about cutting off her skull, exposing her brain.
[leaning over to hold Thirteen’s hands] And she agrees with me because she agrees with me, right, sweetie?
[turning and grabbing one of Kutner’s hands in both of his] Just accept that you've been proven wrong.
Because if I'm right about the brain, then we don't have time to indulge your wrongness.
Good news. [He comes the rest of the way in.] I don't need your approval for some crazy, unproven treatment. I just need to do a test.
Remind me to revoke Kutner’s telephone privileges.
Not searching for MS, but what set it off — equine encephalitis. Turned a cool breeze of MS into a Cat 5 storm.
There's been human cases.
So she got bitten six months ago, or it's some other infection. Whatever it is, it's running rampant in the left side of her brain. When I get in there, I’ll get you the specifics.
So you want proof before you let me go looking for the proof? This is the test.
Cuddy's gonna love you. The patient, on the other hand, is gonna hate you until the day she dies next week. Actually, this idiot will probably forgive you. [He leaves.]
Kid with a raging viral syndrome and three dead mosquitoes. I'm off to storm the Bastille.
Fruit flies. Close enough.
Team's not what it used to be. On the other hand, Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep.
Yes. You used to do this job, remember? That's what used to pass for evidence.
I can't find you the proof you want because it's trapped inside her head. And the only way I can get at it is to cut it open and rip it out, which is apparently the one test you won't let me run. So either I do this, or I do nothing.
I'd certainly like that, yeah.
Nope, I'm just obsessive about clean cuticles.
Right, we should be retesting her pancreas for the umpteenth time.
I'm skipping steps because our patient is skipping steps on the way to being dead. If you've got a better idea…
If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. [He heads into the OR] Unless I kill her, of course.
Not only will this allow us to clock your brain's processing speed, you'll also get free cable for the first three months. [Sarah laughs slightly. House sits in front of her, wearing a mask but no gloves. He shows her a flash card.] What's this?
Nope, my lease is up next month. You like? [She smiles wanly.] I'm gonna ask you a series of questions designed to stimulate left-brain function — logic, reasoning, problem-solving. Or as my mentor, Old Ben, liked to call it, "The dark side." If we find slow areas, we know we found damage. We treat. You go home. Ready?
[showing another flash card] This pen is red. Its ink is red. Is all ink red?
There are two pints in a quart, four quarts in a gallon. How many pints in five gallons?
That's my old boss. [loudly] And by "old," I don't mean "former."
You're not here. Obviously I'm not trying to make you go away. [He holds up another flashcard.] Hint — the answer is a number.
Well, she's certainly not funny. Put the phone down. Pick up the baby. Make us all happy.
Get it back up. I got a whole stack of these.
Baby's crying is annoying you? [to Cameron] What's her nerve conduction?
That doesn't make any sense.
Why does the baby annoy you, but no one else does? I mean, you're right about her, but —
How come the baby annoyed her?
What was different? Our patient loves all things annoying.
She's an earth mother, takes in the freaks and rejects of humanity and tells them they're a-okay. So what was different?
She had low blood pressure. According to the laws of physics, low blood pressure causes light-headedness, chest pain, but not annoyance.
You decided to keep her. Thank you for telling me. You can go now.
You talked at her. You had a chemical reaction.
I'm trying to explain you.
[taking the baby] You think we'll bond?
Is that cute?
If I threw up on you, you'd be pissed.
That's 'cause of your hips. If she would've just gestated a little longer, her stomach sphincter would be fully mature. But, no, we have to walk upright, which means that baby's head is too big for mommy's hips. And by the way, your hips may be an evolutionary improvement. So we've evolved to find baby puke cute, 'cause otherwise we'd kill them all before they became functional. [He freezes, thinking, then stands and starts to leave.] Bonding's over. I got to go see another baby.
[entering] Spleen's fine.
Of course it's her brain.
Didn't look in the right part. Didn't look in the heart part. [He grabs the ultrasound wand and runs it over Sarah’s chest.] In the womb, blood has to bypass the lungs, since they don't work yet. When we're born, we take our first big breath, lungs expand, and the ductus closes. Yours didn't. [He points at the image on the screen.]
When you get stressed, your blood pressure goes up and forces open the ductus. Blood takes a little detour, makes it leak from your nose, your stomach, your lungs, and, more significantly, keeps it flowing to the right side of your brain and away from your left. Which means that when you get stressed, you get unstressed. That's why you're so good with those annoying kids. And why, when your blood pressure dropped, you were able to identify Cuddy as an annoying human being. Good news is we can fix the heart. Bad news for the annoying kids. [He leaves.]
Elevator's broken.
Awfully thin file.
Lots of things can cause pneumothorax. Why don't we let eight or ten other doctors rule out the boring stuff?
(popping what looks like more than one Vicodin pill) Which would make this case attractive to anyone who has some vested interest in people curing the incurable.
Did you just get to work?
Did you take the elevators up?
Yeah. Do a CT looking for hyperinflation to confirm. (The team files out)
Adorable. Elevators keep crashing. Is Mercury in retrograde or what?
(walking back around to the front of the desk) Why do you think the elevators would be out to get me?
You're wrong. I don't even listen to you. Either do your job or go home. Leave me out of it.
Okay.
(to the custodian) Hey, Blue.
People act in their own self-interests. You're all here because you're happy to be here. Or at least because it's your best option.
No, you're here because it makes you feel good to help people. Taub and Foreman are here because they've got no other viable choices. And Thirteen is desperate to make her life matter before it's over.
Does it show?
Do a biopsy. (The team files out. House stops Foreman) Foreman. "You've got to look out for the people you care about." That wouldn't have anything to do with you screwing over your clinical trial by slipping Thirteen the real drug would it?
Does she know? Because Jonas Salk would not approve.
First her lung deflates, like me after a cold shower. Now her liver starts to bleed, like me after—
Great. Just practicing my clown college audition.
Lung, liver, go.
Nope — anybody bother MRIing our patient's liver for tumors?
Yes. So I'm obsessing about why you're not obsessing about why our patient's liver suddenly sprang a leak.
(looking at the scan) What caused the granuloma?
Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light. If it glows, sick children who need her soufflés can breathe easier.
Foreman.
(sitting down behind his desk) You have a problem.
Then you really have a problem. The way she turned her head to look at the MRI... I think she's losing her peripheral vision.
I'm happy for you. A love so deep you're ready to chuck your medical license to give her powerful, unproven drugs with dangerous side effects. I don't want to make any assumptions about your feelings for me, but I do have a birthday coming up.
You're safe.
Cuddy's not playing games. She's not looking for leverage. She wants pure, unadulterated vengeance.
The only time to strike back is when I want something. All I want now is to get things back to normal. Which I can't get by escalating. The only way to win this war is to lose it. Let her punch herself out.
"Too"?
Oh, thank you, rationalization man. You have saved the village. You wanna eat? (He gets down off the exam table)
Not anymore. (House opens the door and exits)
Itch receptors are only in the top two layers of skin. Which means she's not actually itchy, she just thinks she is.
Thanks for the lesson, Deepak. The itching started yesterday, not eight months ago. Meningitis, encephalitis... (He snaps the Vicodin bottle shut and pops a/some pill/pills)
Well, how 'bout we stop guessing and MRI her head instead?
(pulling a folded up magazine from his hip pocket) I brought you something. The latest issue of “Parent” magazine. Really interesting column. Apparently, working moms are actually more engaged and attentive than stay-at-home moms. Something about personal fulfillment.
The point is —
(heading for his office) Where are your coworkers?
(talking to Foreman who has just entered and taken his coat off the rack) Oh, hey, funny you should drop by. We were just talking about this patient of ours. Tell him the part about where two of her doctors don't show up — (Foreman opens the door to leave) Where are you going? (putting something in his jacket pocket and coming back into the conference room) (to Taub and Kutner) Polyneuropathy. It's not in the brain, it's in the nerves. It explains the itching, the lungs, the liver. Shock the affected area, reboot the nerve — she'll be fine.
(following Foreman out into the hallway) Foreman. How bad is she?
You don't need your coat to treat a tumor.
To tell them that you compromised their trial, your ethics, and the patient's health? That's a great idea.
This drug inhibits cell death. I think I could take a wild guess at how I treat that.
Oh, my God, it's been a whole day, and her brain tumor hasn't melted away? (The elevator arrives) If you get on that elevator, and it's only 'cause you're worried about getting to sleep tonight —
So tell her.
A little late for that. (House stops the elevator doors from closing) You need to wait. Because if this thing doesn't go away, she's gonna need you to still have a medical license.
(looking at his watch) Get it from Cuddy.
(holding his leg and sitting up) Warmth would have been nice. No heat, no power. Apparently Mrs. House called the utilities and told them we were moving.
By all means, let's discuss the failed attempts to contact me, not the reason behind them.
Shocks without shock, an itch that won't stop. She needs Dr. Seuss. (He pops a Vicodin)
No sores, no anemia. Where's Foreman?
Because both questions are bound to have the same answer. Ebony and ivory are joined near the hip. Forget the brain. Look lower.
Go find it.
You didn't answer the door.
I was looking for Foreman. I figured... (He pauses, noticing that she is not looking at him) You can't see. Where is he?
(grabbing the phone off a table) Tell him to come back. I'll dial.
You think that drug company has a magic tumor wand that no one else knows about? You need radiation, not ritual sacrifice.
He asked for my advice before he switched you off the placebo. I told him to do it if he loved you.
It's the same thing. Yes, he's an idiot. You didn't ask him to do anything. You're pissed off that he did. So let him torch his career to pay for his sins. Unless, you actually feel something for the idiot. In which case, you might want to tell him to turn around. (He hands the phone to Thirteen who connects the call)
Slow down. Unless you want to radiate her heart instead of her brain. Of course, then your problems would actually all go away.
(watching the monitor) You broke the rules. Girlfriend went blind. You gotta be ready for losing to be one of the possibilities. You're at the carotid bifurcation.
You did it because you love her. Ironically, you never took her into consideration. Can't wait to see what you get her for your anniversary. Catheter's adjacent to the optic chiasm. We're in position. (Using tongs, he takes a small vial out of a box and hands it to Foreman) Nukey, nukey.
Ah, the irony of it. Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all if some other lazy cancer researcher hadn't gone home early.
Shouldn't you be saying, "Those weren't there when we scanned her two days ago?”
Good rephrasing. Have Wilson do a biopsy to confirm.
So what causes masses that do bleed?
So what causes that?
Too late — no surgeon's gonna touch her now.
Don't be silly. You know what that would do to our malpractice insurance rates? We go on the offensive. Cut off the invading army's supply line.
Cut off the arteries that feed blood to the tumors, they wither and die. (pushing the elevator button) Start with the ones in her lungs. If they get any bigger, she's gonna have a hard time breathing. So she'll have a hard time telling us she's dead.
Let's hope that running marathons wasn't on her happy list. (The elevator doors close)
(taking the cane and holding it up to talk to it) Thought I'd never see you again. Little, little Greg. Yeah, you heard me right!
Because you were doing this job perfectly until the baby came along.
I accept. We gonna have to do this dance again in 28 days?
Yesterday, you hate me. Today, you're practically weeping on my shoulder. I can only assume that what I'm hearing is your aunt flow telling me...
Guess our cycles aren't matched up yet.
Nope, this is my way of saying you were doing a crappy job before; you will do a slightly crappier job now. Everything keeps going. Nature of life. Nature of parenthood.
You should go talk to Wilson. Rationalization Man needs a faithful sidekick. Now, Rational Man needs to go save a life.
Damn! Oh, well. (Putting his cane in the waste can, he hooks an empty sanitary napkin box and holds it up) That means the only thing I'm gonna get out of this... Is a diagnosis. (He flips the box to Taub)
Fact that the nurses had to give her anything is. Means she's bleeding from her uterus. (He goes over to the foot of the bed)
She menstruating and, she's bleeding everywhere. There's about a 3 or 4 in 28 chance it's a coincidence. Which leaves a much bigger chance that the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis. She had a myoma eight months ago. Surgeons cut through her uterine wall. Every cut of the scalpel could have sent endometrial cells spilling out into her bloodstream. Some of them took up residence in her lungs, some in her liver, some in her spine. And like all horny little cells, they went forth and multiplied till they reached a critical mass. In the days leading up to her next period, when her uterus is supposed to swell, everything swelled. And when her uterus was supposed to bleed, everything bled. Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period. Granted, it's the worst period ever. Although, frankly, not by all that much. Cut out the masses, she'll be fine.
Well, let's hope she can hold out till then. In the meantime, get her a pint of cookie dough ice cream and a DVD of “Beaches”. (He leaves)
You told them, didn't you? (Foreman nods) Well, you really had no choice... On account of being an idiot. They gonna pull the drug?
Gonna keep your license?
That's very decent of them. (He puts the wallet back into the pocket) Well, good for me. (He closes the locker door) I'll see you tomorrow. (He puts the money in his pants pocket) And the next day. And the next day. (He moves toward the locker room door)
It's a lock-er room. How else are they gonna learn? (He leaves)
Taking a lovely young lady to the Philharmonic.
Two. Can't create a harmonic with just one.
Jewish baby-naming ceremony, a time-honored tradition dating all the way back to the 1960s.
Nothing like welcoming a baby into the world with a completely naked display of hypocrisy.
Wish I could, but I already put down a deposit on 16 crates of Jell-O.
Religious hokum, get sponge bath. Can I get back to you?
Just browsing. Thanks. Happy to be underachieving again?
(looking at a file) Not anymore. Where's this guy?
'Cause he's my next patient. It'd be rude of me not to introduce myself.
Afraid you might have missed something?
So you admit you have no idea which?
Don't thank me. Just knowing I can be of assistance is thanks enough.
There are no small cases. Any guesses where this joke is going?
Could be psychomotor epilepsy…
Atropine toxicity, occipital lobe tumor.
Why would you think that?
Both are possible. There's only one day to find out. Run an EEG for epilepsy. CT his brain for tumors. And go check his House Of God for toxins.
Fourteen, hold up. (Thirteen and Foreman stop) This department is broken, (House sits down at the head of the table) and I'm not gonna take a real case until it's fixed. Job or relationship — your choice.
To put it in terms you might better understand, if you don't split, you must quit.
Don't care.
No, you're not. No, you can’t. And no, I don’t. Mull it over. You got until the end of this fake case to decide.
You're a wuss — part wimp, part puss.
I thought you were already circumcised.
What about the friend who has two tickets to Brubeck at the Blue Note?
I lied.
Yes, but only to save you from yourself.
(wondering) It is oddly flattering.
Cool.
It's cool the priest doesn't believe in God. It's cool that God did to him what he did to the kid.
You think he's innocent?
And you think he's guilty, which explains why you're dying to discharge him.
Aren't we lucky to have such an interesting patient?
The world's most boring case just became a page turner, you want to tear out the last chapter?
(to himself) Bad news for Foreman and Thirteen. (He gets on the elevator, leaving Kutner and Taub looking puzzled)
Case is over.
So which one of you is taking a hike?
Interesting.
(to Foreman) You're fired.
Wrong. Again. In fact, in the last few weeks, it's hard to remember a correct call you made. If Chase had compromised his professional judgment to help Cameron, I’d have fired his ass, too.
To save your license, not your job, and definitely not your relationship. So, badge. (He holds out his hand)
Why don't you see if you can find us a real case. (She leaves)
Must be my lucky day. New symptom means the old symptom was a real symptom, and I get to keep our pederast priest after all.
They left.
Leprosy can cause necrosis and hallucination.
Because Foreman doesn't work here anymore, and Thirteen is mad that I fired him. Don't worry. She'll be back. (House puts away the marker and leans on the whiteboard, staring at it) She'll be pissed off. She'll want to take a stand. And then Foreman will convince her that there's no reason both of them should be out of a job.
Leprosy's a bad fit.
I gave him a choice — split or quit. He chose neither. What about ergotism?
He's giving up this career for her. No, normal white blood count. Carbon monoxide poisoning?
(turning around to face Taub and Kutner) Separately, they're great doctors, better than you. Together, they're morons. Go check out the house that they would've checked had this been a real case. And page Thirteen, tell her to run the blood for CO. And get the priest in a hyperbaric chamber before anything else falls off.
Let's see… How do I keep House from ruining my precious display of religious hypocrisy? I know, I'll pressure him to attend, knowing that he'll never agree to anything I actually want him to do.
So you keeping kosher now, wearing four-cornered garments, slaughtering heifers to the god Ra? Wait, is that one your people? Do it all, do nothing, or option "C" — you're a liar and a hypocrite.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
So the good news is, he didn't have a heart attack. The bad news is, I apparently fired the only guy who actually knows what a heart attack looks like. So the man of God who doesn't believe in God had a heart attack that isn't a heart attack. Do I know how to pick awesome cases or what? Could be a clotting disorder.
I know. How cool is that? You two do an angio. (to Thirteen) You don't want to work, so why don't you just go get me a lottery ticket? The sicker he gets, the luckier I feel.
I've been wanting to introduce myself. (He walks out)
Are you really a virgin?
And before we treat you, we have to diagnose you. Not knowing whether we can believe you is making that difficult.
You lost your faith because a teenager got confused?
God, I wish you weren't a pedophile.
Because there should be. (putting his finger on Daniel’s chest) You feel that?
Not if the chest pain is related to the numbness. It's not circulatory. It's neurological. Run a nerve-conduction study. And be careful. If you kill him, he'll be dancing with the dark one. (House leaves)
Okay.
Okay, your obligation to Cuddy is fulfilled.
Why did Hillary conquer Everest?
She's being childish.
She's trying to play me. If I let her succeed, the terrorists win. (He enters his office)
Or we are at the back stage door of a Duran Duran concert. Hundreds of screaming girls clustered around. What does that mean?
The presence of the fans indicates the presence of the band. Different night — same band, same door. Now there's not a girl in sight. What does that mean?
Nope, the band's still there, still rocking out. When does the absence of the fans not indicate the absence of the band?
They don't make ‘em anymore. If there's no infection, it's because there aren't any fans, no white cells.
Why do I bother with these great metaphors if I still have to spell it out? Yes, I think it's his spleen. Go get a biopsy. I'll try to get "New moon on Monday" out of my head.
Why are you talking this time?
Why?
And you're willing to make that sacrifice for him?
Does Foreman know about this plan?
Well, if he's okay with it, who am I to say no?
That's what they're testing. So if I happen to cure you, what happens then? You start thinking that God was working through me? This is some sort of miracle?
That's what I'm testing.
But if it can magically disappear, it can magically reappear, and that's what you're hoping. Your job…
That's my point. You can make more money frapping decafs, and yet you're still ministering to the meek. Why do the lord's work if the lord has left the building?
I detect the stink of leftover faith.
Solving puzzles. Saving lives is just collateral damage.
Yeah, I want to walk out and find myself in a forest of whore trees, but I don't think it's a good idea to tell people to go fornicate with fruit. (He leaves)
Hey, I was just talking about you… Not you specifically — whores and hypocrisy.
Okay.
I'm really not coming.
You're welcome. Gosh, I feel so grown up.
Why do people suddenly find religion when they have kids?
So it makes sense because it doesn't make sense.
I've got a thing for my boss's thing. She doesn't have a thing… per se. I'm big on metaphors. What about you? 29 years of celibacy. What's holding you back now?
Who wants a relationship?
(looking at Daniel through the glass) So father Nietzsche has AIDS.
(now standing behind his desk) And you get brought up on charges. I've lost enough doctors this week. Treat him for AIDS. (He sits down behind his desk. Taub and Kutner leave)
Your attendance is validating her hypocrisy. If she invited you to a ceremonial lynching, would you go?
Just making conversation. Would you rather we go back to talking about mushrooms and cheese?
Yes, but not until her 16th birthday… in some states.
Wow, solid advice, except for two things. I'm acting like I don't wanna go because I don't wanna go, and… (He surreptitiously swipes some food off of the tray of a boy who is walking by) I am incapable of acting like a human being. (House takes a bite of the food he swiped and glances back toward the boy)
Love, sacrifice, deception, and now betrayal. This is better than a telenovela.
Well… either Foreman is here, as the two of you discussed, to beg for his job back in exchange for me dumping you, or… nothing.
Yeah! Who's the controlling bitch now?
Well, either you can go after her and try and patch things up, or you blow her off and take your old job back.
Welcome back.
So went Satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote Job sore with boils.
I prefer the colloquial term "Job syndrome." Explains the symptoms, and my quote.
Are you kidding? I've never felt more alive. Conflict breeds creativity. Go run the genetic tests.
Nope. But please, feel free to blather on.
Religion is not the opiate of the masses. Religion is the placebo of the masses. If you're saying she's not a hypocrite —
Oh, sorry. Continue.
We can know everything.
Truth is truth. (He erases “hallucinations” from the board) It fits.
I can if it's not a symptom.
Not a symptom. (House leaves)
(He stands beside Daniel’s bed) You're not gonna die. You have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. It impairs your immune system, makes you susceptible to all the AIDS stuff without actually having AIDS. And you didn't catch it. You were born with it. Another gift from God.
Genetic test should confirm it, but it explains all your symptoms — toe, chest, eyes, skin.
Scotch explains that.
Coincidences do happen.
You promised you wouldn't go there.
A woman in Florida said, "look, Jesus is on my cheese sandwich."
The fact that I was wrong is not a proof of God.
Don't worry. Your life will go back to sucking soon enough. Everything that happened to you can be rationally explained.
It's cold out there.
So it's tonight?
Maybe you'll get lucky. Maybe your sister will decide the roads are too dangerous to drive on.
Have fun.
You gonna eat that? (meaning Wilson’s breakfast)
Yes we can.
(reaching up to take the file) Fun!
Less fun, but still.
(throwing a patient file to each member of the team) Our new patient, part girl, part boy, all Thirteen’s dream date.
I won’t do it. (pause) You guys will though.
Well that was your experience. Must surely apply in this situation.
Way to multitask, impress your boss and humiliate your ex. MRI’s a waste of time. To continue the humiliation, go put a camera up his penis.
(clearly surprised by their unannounced entrance) These people were just coming to tell you. This is better, don’t have to worry about them losing their way.
(looking at Thirteen) Did you send them a text?
Well, who needs med school when you’ve got Wi-Fi? (to the team) Go schedule their son for an MRI with contrast right away.
So’s arguing with them.
(who looks bored) With what?
Completely unfazed? You think I’m totally lacking in any fazing? The idea that I’m anything less than half-fazed, I actually find offensive. It greatly fazes me.
Vitamins
Now I’m unfazed. Start him on corticosteroids for the autoimmune and Finasteride to block the vitamins.
So, you have pain in one arm and both your legs. Does it hurt right now?
(taking the patient’s right forefinger and squeezing it) How about this?
Aaahh!
I think my penis stopped breathing; do you know CPR?
I’m fine, other than the fact that my nurple is now purple. (to Thirteen) No wonder you broke up with him. I’m surprised yours are still attached.
(to Thirteen) By the way, I can see that from here. I assume those are our patient’s lab results.
It's called Vicodin, I took too many.
(loudly) Can I please get some information about our patient?
I don’t remember hiring my Mother. What causes the enzymes in little Boy George’s existing heart problem and pelvic pain?
I don’t remember having breakfast with my Mother.
Search the school; search the home.
Both. (He gets up from the chair)
(grabbing his jacket) Nowhere, I’m staying right here, so we can properly discuss this. (He walks out the door)
Downer, and medically irre… (his voice fades out as if he’s falling back asleep)
(to Kutner with his eyes still closed) Back off. Only Thirteen gets to grab my nipples this time.
Unless the next stanza reads, “Hoping to fry my brain to death, I smoked some primo crystal meth,” I’m not interested.
We’re not here to make him happy; we’re here to diagnose him.
(about the drinks) When did you order these?
I came here expecting a burger. Figured I’d have to endure a little lecture on moderation.
Instead, I get a drink; a nice little serving of respiratory depressant on the day that my lungs stop working.
You don’t believe that I OD’d on Vicodin. You figure I’m on something stronger, and because you can never, ever assume anything but the most screwed up scenario as far as I’m concerned —
You think that I’m on Heroin. This is your version of a tox screen. Because if I am on Heroin; I can’t drink that without risking another bout of not breathing.
Goodnight. (He gets up from the table and leaves)
Okay, I admit it. I have bulimia. I look good though, don't I?
I'm not on heroin.
I'm on methadone. Stupid product. Heroin without the high.
But no risk of arrest.
Today was a fluke. I nodded off.
I'm not detoxing.
Doesn't help my pain, it eliminates it. (House tosses his cane into a nearby dumpster and turns to walk away. He pauses) My leg doesn't hurt anymore. (He walks out toward the street leaving Wilson bewildered)
I'm not breathing, but it's strictly voluntary. Should've seen the guy who was in here before me.
(sighing) It's legal. I have a prescription.
He knows I'm in pain. What I put in my body is my business.
If you'd said that if I keep doing this you could die, then it'd be your business.
I'll send someone for my stuff. (He starts to walk out)
I'm choosing lack of pain over this job. (He walks out)
I hired her to watch me sleep — make sure I don't stop breathing.
She's not a nurse.
Surprisingly, hookers are cheaper. And they don't sue for sexual harassment. (holding up two ties) Which one?
The red one then.
(walking across the room to a small mirror on the wall) Meeting at St. Sebastian's today. Gonna try and talk 'em into starting up a diagnostics department.
(Tying his tie in front of the mirror) I'm fine.
I have an interview, in two hours.
Hand over my letter of recommendation.
You have no right to sabotage —
Seems weird, getting my meds here when I'm working somewhere else.
I want a raise.
And a bigger office... but in the same spot.
Okay.
(sincerely) Thank you.
I have issues with authority. You?
Cuddy missed me.
She asked to borrow it for some reason. Patient dead or do I need to do anything? (House takes off his tie and loosens his shirt collar)
Wow. Two days, and you've already got two separate theories. (House sits down)
When did you two come up with this?
So, what did we miss? When I say "we" I mean "you," since I wasn't here.
That was a dumb idea.
Because it was wrong.
Oh, crap. (pause) This kid like energy drinks?
Nice work. (He gets up and heads for the door)
Why wouldn't we be? (to Thirteen about her shoes) Nice heels. (House leaves)
This is all your parents' fault.
(to Jackson) Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice? (Jackson nods)
Your son came in here with simple dehydration. That's why he collapsed during the game.
That's where the energy drinks came in. They put a strain on his kidneys so he needed more time to rebound from the initial dehydration.
That's where your idiocy came in. Before we could give him another glass of water, you two insisted I do an MRI. So, I go down a blind alley looking for a blind uterus. And my team injects him with contrast material. If his kidneys had been healthy, they would've filtered out the contrast in a couple hours. Since they weren't, it went around and around, eventually getting absorbed by his heart, his liver, and his pancreas; getting in trouble everywhere it went. Your son was fine when he got here. It was your freaked-out overprotectiveness that nearly killed him.
He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine.
You gave birth to a freak of nature. (He turns and opens the door) Doesn't mean it's a good idea to treat him like one. (House leaves the room)
I'm done with the methadone. I screwed up.
I knew he didn't need it. I did it anyway. That's what got him sick.
I created a case. I played nice because, I was in a good mood because, I didn't hurt. (He gets up)
(firmly) I'm not interested in good.
Why do you care if I'm happy?
No.
It's already done. (He throws the methadone in the wastebasket and grabs a hospital cane which is propped against the wall) This is the only me you get.
Doesn't look like a friendship bracelet.
You're telling me this patient got a railroad spike drilled through his frontal lobe? (He takes the patient file)
Whereas our guy became a different person after Chardonnay.
(to Foreman) MRI show anything?
Good. What fun would that be? So the tumor's not in the cool neighborhood. It's cool neighborhood adjacent.
(handing the file to Foreman) Go stick a scope up Phineas's nose. See what you find. (The team leaves)
Wednesday night. Low-down-blue-meanie versus the Incinerator.
Let me rephrase. Low-down-blue-meanie —
Not when it follows "low-down-blue-meanie." Is the world coming to an end Tuesday night? Otherwise, Wednesday—(they stop)
Yes, you do.
You've always liked monster trucks.
What are you hiding?
No, it's not. We may be able to fix his impulse to say his thoughts out loud, but he always gonna be the guy who thinks them.
You would argue that. You're all persona.
There's damage somewhere in his brain. Go find it. (Kutner leaves)
You're welcome.
You're 40 years old…
The administrator of a hospital…
People don't get personal with you. Except for me, and you dismiss me as a jerk who's jerking you around. (They stop at the elevator) But that guy can only tell the truth. And he prefers your body to that of a smoking young hottie.
You didn't get the slightest kick out of that?
Anyone sitting here?
You know, it's amazing the way people cling on to insults. Or what they think are insults. (He takes a sandwich and fries off of Wilson’s plate and puts them on his own)
I'm not suggesting that, like our patient, you're hiding a dark, sarcastic core beneath a candy shell of compulsive niceness. (House has pulled a fork out of his breast pocket)
Because you know nice bores me. Hence, still nice. No, I'm suggesting that you have no core. You're what whoever you're with needs you to be. Okay, I guess that could be insulting. The interesting question is why. Why do you think the world will end in chaos and destruction if you're not there to save it? (He starts eating Wilson’s lunch)
And why'd you lie about monster trucks?
I checked your appointment book. You got tomorrow night marked off, but you didn't put down what you were doing. So you thought someone might look at the book —
Why would you hide that?
You say that as though it wouldn't be fun.
(to Taub) Hey, Cyrano de Berkowitz. Let it go.
(to Taub) So how long have you been playing racquetball with Wilson?
(swinging his cane like a tennis racket) First of all, Wilson played tennis on his college team, and you are a Jew. You're not athletic. Run to the end of the hall and back. I'll time you.
Sandy Koufax is all you Jews go on about. Sandy Koufax, and the Holocaust. (he sits down) Gets old.
(to Taub) Is a z-shot offensive or defensive?
You suspected that was a trick question.
We can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidates. Test for peripheral nerve damage.
That would be petty. I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me. Let me know when you're ready to confess everything. (The team leaves)
(still tossing the ball) I need you to update me on the patient's condition.
I need you to update me on the patient's condition (he sits up and holds up the ball) while hitting this against the wall. (House tosses the ball to Taub who catches it) This is the only place we can do both.
I expect the people who work for me to rise to a challenge. Unless they don't expect to work for me.
So the glucose was normal. Means you were wrong about diabetes.
So you're going for thyroid instead of pancreas? Makes sense.
(nods) Not bad. You put on a good show. You studied up. Wilson actually booked a court. If you were really a racquetball player, you'd know that you were holding a squash racket. (pause) Tell Kutner to do a thyroid reuptake scan, I’ll go grab a nap in one of the on-call rooms. (He gets up and heads out the door)
Go back to Phineas, get a history.
Get a detailed history.
Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something. (Taub starts to leave)
(to Taub) Not you. Kutner can do it. You're gonna be busy with something else. (Kutner leaves)
You sound pleased about something. Can we get to that part?
Was the wife there to hear this?
Too bad. Keep going.
The dog was fixing the television?
The patient's eyes red?
Bacterial. He lucked out. Start him on doxycycline. If he improves, we'll know we were right.
And now you're telling me. What does that make you, a quadruple agent? (They walk into House’s office)
Wow. Excellent. Information he wants us to have. Did he let you print out his deleted e-mails?
Then go back there —
(reading the email) Writing to confirm Wednesday at 7:00 PM.
Secret consult, 7:00 PM. (He finds a picture of Joan Gonzalez online) Oh, Joan is perky.
Where? (He holds out his hand for the file)
No. Wilson doesn't password-protect his patient files. I'm the only one he'd expect ever to look there, and he knows there's only one patient I'd want to check on.
(typing again) If Wilson had cancer, there'd be no reason for him to drive three hours to Manhattan. He could pull strings here and get the best treatment. (He pulls up a list of articles on his computer screen) Six articles by Gonzalez. "Managing suicidal thoughts in oncology patients," "Suicidal ideation in children with leukemia."
(turning to look at Taub and speaking very curtly) No. Get out of here. (Taub leaves, House looks worried)
(getting up and approaching Wilson) Your assistant said that you were out of the hospital, taking a walk.
I don't know. Is there? You never take a walk unless you've got something you need to think about.
The other thing you do when you need to think is you come to my office. (Wilson turns away from House) Apparently, this is something you can only discuss with Gonzalez at New York Mercy. (Wilson pauses and turns to face House)
Private dick.
Of course you need hot coffee. It's 45 degrees outside, and you left your coat upstairs. Why?
Once you get outside, the cold would have reminded you. You could have come back, but you didn't. You chose to be uncomfortable. Now, why would someone choose that? Because they hate themselves?
If you're here to say thanks, you're welcome. Now go away.
Oh, all the more reason to go away.
Those are the breaks. (He walks over to his desk)
You could die.
(handing Nick’s file to Chase) I want you to remove a small problem.
But your boss is. You could assist. I'm sure you'd like to add to your resume.
Your boss would. He's an egomaniac. I know 'cause I keep seeing him at the club. He just needs a little push. I'm sure by now you've kissed his ass sufficiently. (Chase laughs and turns to put the clothing he is holding and the file on the sink. He takes a sip from a coffee cup on the counter) Would you like me to phrase it as "you're politically gifted"? I can do that.
Why what?
My patient has a quality of life issue.
(with eyes downcast, not making eye contact with Chase) When he leaves here, he's going to lose his family. He's gonna alienate the people he works with. And if he ever finds a friend who's willing to put up with his crap, he'll be lucky. Until he drives them away too. (He glances sideways at Chase who has realized how personal this has become for House. House is speaking as much about himself as he is about Nick)
(looking at Wilson) You've apparently got this whole coat thing backwards.
You definitely overreacted.
It made me think. You only snap on one subject: losing people. So I went back to the intel. It's true there's only one doctor named Gonzalez at New York Mercy, but there's a Javier Gonzalez who's a nurse in the psych ward. And who could you lose who'd end up there?
Daniel Wilson. (pause) Once you got a name, it's amazing how much stuff you can learn on the phone. I mean, if you're a doctor and you lie freely. They found your brother sleeping in the lobby of an office building in Manhattan. Got aggressive when they asked him to leave, and the cops took him to the Mercy psych ward.
But you're not sure if he wants to.
Why wouldn't you tell me this?
I am fully capable of lying to you. I've lied plenty of times.
Because it might all go horribly wrong.
In which case, you might want some company. (Wilson walks back toward House as if he cannot believe what he just heard)
(handing Wilson his coffee and sitting down across from him) You told me you saw your brother once. After he disappeared.
That's why you were so eager when I told you there was a job at Princeton. I thought it was just my charm.
They already texted me to say they're doing something stupid. (Wilson smiles)
The spell-correct on Kutner’s phone has got a hair trigger. Either that, or the patient has a “cyclone in the floral of his lungs.” (He closes his phone) You took a walk in 45-degree weather, and you left your coat behind.
I think you were punishing yourself. I think you wanted to feel what it would be like be homeless in a New Jersey winter. That tells me, guilt. That tells me, something happened.
Where were you?
Interesting. Later for that. Go on.
I wonder how that turned out?
So you made your one effort to live a normal, selfish life, and the universe immediately smacked you down. And because we're wired to find meaning in semi-random events, you decided never to be that careless again.
Actually, I don't. I think you did it consciously. You developed your people-pleasing talents (House gets up and faces Wilson) the way an Olympic athlete develops his muscles. Talk about an overreaction to a single event.
Hanging up the phone? That's what you're blaming all this on. That's the behavior you've been trying to correct. As though nothing else went wrong in your brother's life. Of course, he overreacted too but… (talking more to himself than to Wilson) His glucose was normal? (the aahha moment)
It's House. AVMs don't explain his glucose.
(into the phone) Yeah.
(still talking on his phone) Explain that.
You'd given him steroids. His glucose should have been elevated. That wannabe cyst you found in the whole body scan; without the glucose, it's an irrelevant cyst. With the glucose, it's a relevant fibroma. He has Doege-Potter syndrome.
This whole thing is an overreaction. That one small fibroma. It's benign, but his body's acting like it's an invader. His antibodies went to war against it and got carried away, attacked his other systems. Take out the fibroma, he'll be a happy hypocrite again in no time. (House puts away his phone and turns to find that Wilson is no longer there)
You okay?
Sure. He sounds interesting. (knowing that Wilson has more to say) Go on.
Which is better than terrible.
Does it bother you that we have no social contract?
Okay.
It is kind of fun watching you torture yourself.
No. But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault.
You do actually like monster trucks?
I'm waiting for a follow-up.
I've been in this room a while, but it's spring now, right? [He climbs off the table he was standing on.]
Run-down. Come on, give me something. Sore throat?
Runny nose?
[loudly] Dr. Cuddy, I need a consult. [Cuddy enters.] Until she stops seizing, I may as well go back to my office and get my diagnosis on.
She's having a seizure. If she hadn't peed it would…
Interesting.
35-year-old woman. Head of nursing at an old age home.
From now on I'm gonna use two colors. Green indicates irony.
Welcome, your lordship. We were just preparing your morning briefing.
"Us" aren't taking anything. I'm taking. You're accepting.
[looking away] Go check out the house and the office for toxins and infections.
Luckily, neither are you.
So your insight is based on discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug at an old-age home.
You ever tried to pee on yourself in public? It's not easy.
For good reason. I can spot a fake seizure. Which means this was real. Which means her problem is phenol.
It's still in some antiseptic throat sprays. She's been chugging it all winter for her colds. Phenol explains the seizure and the urine.
Which is why I'm sure you won't have trouble discovering evidence of it when you search her house. Bye. [Taub leaves. To Kutner] And you can start her on charcoal hemoperfusion for the phenol poisoning. [Kutner starts to leave.] Seriously?
Because I don't want him to know that I'm wasting my time disproving his fake seizure theory. [He indicates zipping his lip.] Zip.
Head CT was negative.
Sure. How about I flash some lights in front of your face first?
We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a problem.
Dammit.
What are you worried about? You have maybe a night in jail for fraud. I have to go tell one of my employees he was right.
You'll have to come up with something more original.
Cats make terrible doctors. Oh no, wait, that's women. You're screwed. [He leaves.]
If you're going to kill me and rape me, please do it in that order.
Debbie. Sorry, but without a last name…
[calling from his desk] Can you come back later? I have some business I’m conducting with the Prince of Nigeria.
Quick! Before she goes without attention for eight seconds.
[He gets up, goes to the door but doesn’t open it.] She's faking. The cat told me.
Gotta say, I don't think the changes they've made to American Idol really work for me.
Don't we all have quirks? Aren't those eccentricities what make us human?
Nut jobs get sick too.
Well, anything would sound ridiculous if you said it in that voice.
There's that voice again.
Consecutive?
[holding Debbie] No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die. Bronchospasm, go.
He might have. Dude had a lair. Means he was rich. [He puts Debbie on the floor.] Rich people enjoy a good stogie, sometimes send them as gifts. Hey, Taub! Did that sound like I was awkwardly trying to segue into making a point?
It's more possible that it was just a coincidence. 10 million nursing homes.
We shoulda listened to Ted Nugent.
The worms hop from the cat to the cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.
Hey, that reminds me, why is some fancy CEO sending you a box of Cuban cigars? Is it related to your money worries?
Extrapolating from the fact that he's been skipping his morning muffin, I'd say that he lost almost all his money on the market last year.
I'm also extrapolating from the online portfolio you forget to log off. But it's mostly the muffins. Scope her for worms in the lungs.
What else could cause bronchospasm?
Because patients sometimes crash, and they haven't yet invented a crash tractor for me to drive wildly around the hallways.
No, I know the cat is not going to predict anyone's death. Then I will have scientifically disproved…
If I could prove the non-existence of an omniscient God who lovingly guides us to the other side, I would. Cat version will have to do. [He shoves Debbie toward Kutner who pulls back slightly.] Are you scared?
Please tell me that you were kidding so I won't have to fire you.
Of course not. This is a double-blind. I don't want to even subconsciously
[injecting the patient with something] That never happened.
Good news, Mister… Limpert, when you don't die tonight you will finally have done something good for the world as opposed to your life as a… fireman. Foreman's airborne allergen theory makes the most sense. Do a methacholine challenge on Catgirl to check it out.
Do you see a cat?
[brandishing his cane] This is a disability, Dr. Cuddy. Can't make it to the men's room on time.
Well, now you see the mice actually prove that I don't have a cat. [There’s a tank of mice in the corner.]
Genetically modified for tastiness. [He smacks his lips together several times.]
My team's doing a methacholine challenge.
Who told you about the test? Taub?
Her airways clamped down. I heard it. We kick her onto the street, it could happen again. I wish there was a lawsuit cat. It could warn you.
You’re joining me for a good-bye smoke.
Fine. If you don't want the seventh graders to think you're cool. [He lights a cigar and blows the smoke at her.] I went through your purse. Horoscopes. Good luck charms. You went to a good college, good nursing school. So you weren't always a superstitious idiot.
How 'bout four years, that sound right? That's when you switched from a family insurance plan to the one you're on now.
Two years before that, you got chicken pox shots, which you only get in adulthood when you have a kid. Or I should say when you had a kid because no kid has come to visit you. Which all makes me think something bad happened.
What happened?
You want to make it make sense.
It’s meaningless, is what’s wrong. What’s wrong is that it doesn’t do a thing to bring your kid back, or put you and your ex together again. [Morgan starts coughing.] Rash on your neck. Probably not enough for Cuddy. [He puffs harder, blowing the smoke at Morgan.]
Hey, doc. [He calls over a doctor who is nearby.] Breath sound soft to you, doc? [The doctor listens to Morgan’s chest and nods.] Hooray! You're officially sick.
Churg-Strauss fits best. Here's the plan… Taub, change the litter box.
Nope, this is for ratting me out to Cuddy. I'm not asking you to apologize, just scoop some poop out of a box.
What, you think your bag's gonna die now?
It's not so much about me caring per se. It's more about me wondering why you're such a credulous idiot. Thirteen, start the patient on steroids for the Churg-Strauss. Unless we have something we need to argue about.
I'm just a girl who can't say no.
[hanging his cane on a bookshelf] She didn't fake the bronchospasm. You think she's faking some stuff but not other stuff? Maybe she's "Unchausen".
Nothing.
Brown could be fecal. A fistula…
Had to be. Once you've gone brown…
[sitting] Purple. Strep bovis infection from colon cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the bronchospasm.
Oh, no.
What? Not everything's about you, Kutner.
Great, 'cause I thought your superstitiousness had to do with your folks being killed. But "you're stupid" works just as well. [He cracks a hard boiled egg against his forehead and starts peeling it.]
Oops. Forgot that one. [He picks up the ladder and repositions it diagonally across the doorway.] Scopes don't work as well as pillcams. Give her one. Find the tumor. Come with me, tiny Taub.
Knew it when I hired you. You'd eventually miss the money, being the big shot like your new CEO friend, if that night club stamp on your hand is any indication.
I know. Guy who signs a non-compete instead of just telling his wife that he cheated doesn't have the guts to quit.
From guilt, not from courage. And bravely running to Cuddy behind my back. Arriving heroically late every day. Cowards make lousy employees. Maybe you're a coward, maybe you're quitting. Either way, I'm screwed. [He leaves.]
You will note how “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” has snuggled up by Coma Guy over there. And more importantly, she did yesterday as well. And he's still breathing. We done?
In 1844 a preacher in upstate New York added up some dates in the bible and predicted Jesus' return. His followers gave away all their possessions and showed up in a field. Guess who didn't show. So the preacher said that he miscalculated, and they went right back the next month but with more followers. Every time he was irrefutably proved wrong, it redoubled everyone's belief.
That would be dumb as she might be dying.
I don't care if her superstitions make her feel better. I just want her to think more clearly.
Experimenting. [The “backpack” yowls. Another doctor in the elevator looks around.] Stop it, Dr. Wilson. It’s just not cute anymore!
Not to the patient. And not to the millions of idiots who drooled over that news item about the magic cat.
Hey, look, kids, therapy cat.
Aren't you feisty? This one's special. If she likes you interesting stuff happens.
I don't believe in the legend of goodbye kitty.
I'd love to hear more of your theory, but I don't give a crap. [He checks the message on the phone] Also, the pillcam's back.
Polypoid. Raised edges.
Oh my God, the death cat is attacking your legs. You're going to die.
[continuing to point the laser at Kutner’s feet] Oh my God, the death laser is attacking your legs. You're going to die.
Skin cancer could have metastasized to the intestines. Cool. Check for melanomas.
What?
Spider veins means Cushing's. Could cause an abdominal disturbance, brown urine…
Cushing's myopathy. It's uncommon but… [He turns on the light and winces.] Wait a second. You didn't wake me up to tell me a symptom that's not killing her. What else is going on?
I just told you it's Cushing's. We treat…
If that's my high school gym teacher…
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.
You're right. Sulking will solve everything. That cat sat on my lap, and that cat knows something.
Yesterday it was until I unintentionally proved it wasn't.
Exactly, except if you'd glanced at the nursing home files I had faxed over this morning, you'd know that most of the patients' livers and kidneys were fine; what else?
So check her ACTH.
Well, maybe as the senior fellow you could have made sure that my doors were closed, so that I could be concentrating on the cat instead of looking for the cat.
Cheaper than fake blood. And more cran-tastic. Don't ever leave my door open like that again.
So have Chase do a venous sampling in her brain. If he finds something, it's there. If he finds nothing, it's the adrenals.
Catnip. Chew toy. I don't know. That's why I'm looking…
That tell us anything?
So nothing. What about the ACTH?
That confirms the Cushing's is in the brain… go.
If it had a normal presentation, there wouldn't be a cat involved.
That's not a question for me. That's a question for the patient. You'll present both sides and let her decide.
You mean the theory about Cuddy's ass getting bigger at the full moon? I confirmed that one. Photo’s on my blog.
Case is over. I'm exploring a scientific mystery.
Early.
You got a new job?
Well then, you're not quitting. See you back here tomorrow.
Easier this way. It avoids the whole thing where you panic, run back and grovel, and I punish you and then take you back.
Bring donuts. Everyone loves those bear claws.
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss. Puss?
I was right. And more satisfyingly, you were wrong. It was a coincidence. The cat was not predicting deaths. It was just trying to keep warm.
They are if they're feverish, like three of the patients were. Or if they're wasting away, like the other eight.
Yeah, it does. If it means someone sticks a heating blanket on you.
Completely trivial. My God. It's clearly only partially trivial. Debbie climbed on Morgan too, which means she was overheated. So what causes flushing and mimics every Cushing's symptom except central body obesity?
Means it must be somewhere the pillcam couldn't go.
Yes, I did. [grabs the phone] What's the O.R. extension number? Just curious.
I wouldn't come here for thanks. That would be ungracious. It's more about gloating. You were about to cut out a piece of your brain just to chase some crazy superstition.
You "didn't" didn't do anything. I stopped it.
Science. Logic. Reason. Pick any three.
You're an idiot.
Because his followers were as deluded as he was.
Feel better. [He leaves.]
Kutner! [Kutner comes in from the conference room.] Cat pee on my chair?
Fake blood! [Kutner just stares at him.] You pay for the dry-cleaning. [He picks up his cars and his backpack and leaves.]
See you tomorrow.
[VO] Hey, genius. I think it violates certain ethical laws to rip the organs out of a guy who's still alive. Possibly certain law laws too.
It's actually Doctor House. [House comes into view or, rather, his blue shirt does. The left elbow is ripped and bloody.]
There's also Navy Seal House. But you're going to have to save up for that one.
Scraped my elbow. I just need a truckload of Vicodin. Whereas, this guy…
See that?
I discerned it.
Then why is his eye following you?
I also know about locked-in syndrome… That things are either involuntary… or voluntary. Blink if you can hear me.
Oh, this is going to be fun.
The square root of nine? [three blinks] He got that faster than you. Brain is fully functional. [House has an ugly bruise on his left cheekbone, directly under the eye.]
Unless… the crash didn't cause the brain damage. Maybe the brain damage caused the crash.
[checking Lee’s hands] Look at his palms. No scrapes. He didn't even try to protect himself. Suggests slowed reflexes… or no reflexes.
[ignoring Kurtz] Get me the scans. Stroke, cancer, even a simple infection. Anything that insults the central pons could do this.
Stop it. I'm blushing.
Just looking for some reading material for the crapper. These CTs —
Never better.
If you can't bring Mohammed to Princeton, bring Princeton to Mohammed. That's my diagnostics posse. Hot, dark and darker. [He gestures using a French fry.]
Buying a Gibson '57 Goldtop. It's the guitar Duane Allman used to play.
CT was clean.
Guy's an active bike rider, his heart's fine.
She's the smart one. I just keep dark and darker to fill out the quota. If we find it, treat it, you could be fine.
If you're praying in there, stop it right now.
His doctor's busy teaching him how to blink out "kill me" in Morse code. Luckily, I found some forms under the mattress. [He pulls them out. Kutner hands him a pen and he signs them.]
I guess you like me.
What? By God?
You spend an awful lot of time in church for someone who doesn't.
It's either one or the other.
God is also the guy who opened his car door in front of you.
I think so.
Hope you don't mind. My new roommate snores. And my new room doesn't have you. [He turns on the light.] Your MRI showed a lesion in the central pons. [Pulls out MRI film.]
See it there? [He points to a spot on the film.]
Mm, that's what they said. But it's there. Which means no way head trauma did this. It's cancer, causing a paraneoplastic syndrome. Unfortunately, your current doctor thinks its diffuse nature means an infection. Now the bad news is, the antivirals he's got you on might kill you.
But the good news is if they just almost kill you, then Dr. Idiot will realize that his name is not a coincidence and he'll let me do whatever I want.
See, the irony here is… you're kind of fascinating. So many questions. But if you could answer any of them, then you wouldn't be fascinating.
Your wife is the one getting you through this. Your wife and me. Although frankly, the MRI was a lot more useful than four hours of hand-holding. I think.
You're a good guy. Easy to talk to.
Need some help in here! Your patient is seizing.
Because he has cancer!
Welcome back. And nicely played. You almost died. [Out of side of his mouth as if it were a secret, but at normal speaking volume.] Exactly as we planned.
It usually happens when you treat cancer by pretending it's not cancer. Right, doctor? My turn?
A small tumor in his brain stem, causing paraneoplastic syndrome. He needs plasmapheresis.
I don't. Which means I can treat him.
Would you send up a couple of bellboys?
Fresh infusion of macho. You like?
Antiquing. I found you a late Victorian corset. Come by later, I'll tie you up.
Probably because there was no message. I've decided to accept your resignation.
No, you didn't. You had it decided for you. So now you're stuck here with a boss who knows that you want to be somewhere else. Which means you're no longer motivated to impress me, which means you're no longer motivated to come up with good ideas. Unless I'm wrong. Save the cheerleader. Save your world. [They reach the elevator.] I got it from here.
What do you care?
I was buying a guitar.
You live ten miles from Mary's Dress Shop. And yet, that's not even on my list of reasons that I think you're secretly a transvestite.
I went to visit your ex-ex-ex-wife…
…who lives in Thompson Ridge. I let her know about the extra money you're making on the lecture circuit. So she'll be sure to adjust your alimony.
Yeah. I wouldn't do that.
He's a roofer. Alcohol hardly proves your theory.
Either we play 20,000 questions with every street drug, or instead of talking to him, we talk to the lesion.
For the record, that doesn't count as your inspired idea. It's sort of where I was heading.
God's mistakes are well-documented. If he'd done everything right the first time, there'd have been one plague and zero great floods.
You think your doctor has an apartment on Mount Olympus?
[pause] I don't know.
Two options: My neurologist screwed up, or else something the hospital lawyer's going to have to come up with when you sue us.
It's possible. Also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone.
He had one way to communicate and now that's gone. Well played.
Did he report having bloody diarrhea?
Did you ask him?
If he had Epstein-Barr, he'd have belly pains. If he had picornavirus, he'd have headaches. Five other yes/no questions, and maybe we'd know what treatment to give. And what treatment would kill him. Unless he's already dead.
You know how you hate it when I meddle in your lies? I mean your life.
Interesting. This has nothing to do with you, your ex-wife, or my pain. I was heading to the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill.
It's where Foreman's brother is being held.
Have you had any bloody diarrhea in the last two weeks?
Any recent joint pain?
Good. Could be Missouri malaria. Let's start treatment.
Hmmm. Either that or he lied to you about it. People do that sometimes. For example, I just lied to him about Missouri malaria.
When you weren't in St. Louis for two days, I assume you were getting some strange for two days.
Amazing. A man who only has two blips at his disposal can still lie.
If you were getting some really strange strange, you could've contracted neurosyphilis. Infection went to your brain, froze you right up. Good news is it's treatable. You'll be up and moving in time to sign the divorce papers.
Were you out of the state?
Were you within 20 miles of your house?
[VO] Were you within five miles?
[VO] Within two miles?
Did you stay at a hotel?
You had to sleep somewhere. Your car?
A friend's house?
That narrows it down, depending on how popular you are. Tell the wife to stop crying, get in here. [Molly enters the picture as the camera continues to circle around all three of them on the suburban street.] He says that when he was supposed to be in St. Louis, he was staying at a friend's house.
Let's assume that you believe him for the moment. Name your friends within two miles.
Guess someone who doesn't have a wife.
Got an address?
Great. All you gotta do is come up with a good idea.
That's a great idea. For the guy who invented the computer that can read minds. Your idea was to use his idea.
What's interesting is why you're here now. Not when I gave you the ultimatum. Was it something the patient said?
Kutner found the battery factory. Kutner came up with the cadmium. Maybe you don't matter.
[sticks his arm out without looking away from the white board] He's locked-in, his kidneys blew a fuse, and now his eye is oozing pus.
Ow! [He looks at the bruise on his elbow for a minute then returns to the white board.] The way he's losing his myelin makes an infection most likely. Could be varicella —
But the initial acyclovir would've treated that. Which pushes me towards an autoimmune disease. Like Behcet's.
[He empties the cup into his mouth.] Oops. [She scrubs the bruise.] Ho! Of course, if the varicella was resistant, it wouldn't matter what they did up in Middletown.
You've been in the ER too long. When the patient had head trauma, white blood cells only indicate that he had head trauma.
Why did I fire you again?
Busy. Kutner's doing an LP, so I have to focus.
You know what's more interesting than what I was doing? The reason you are so obsessed with what I was doing.
Says the deflector. The reason I was up there is the reason you're scared I was up there. I was checking out your dirty, little secret. How long have you been sleeping with her?
Your only secrets are the girls you find embarrassing. And the only embarrassing girl you've met recently is the one at your brother's cuckoo facility.
She's a caregiver. Like all of your other failed exes. And someone who takes care of your brother. Who was the last person who took care of your brother?
Actually, I was thinking masturbatory, but I guess your mom took care of him first. So, the safe course is to gouge your eyes out.
[sitting in a beach chair] It doesn't seem that way.
Not yet. [pause as medical monitor can be heard beeping] But you're about to be.
[simultaneously, almost inaudibly] The arrest means the demyelination hit the area in his brainstem that controls heart rhythm. We need answers fast, ‘cause this is going to happen again.
Not without the results of the LP.
Shut up, shut up. [Lee’s computer is beeping “no,” “yes,” “no,” “yes.”] He's trying to talk. [“Yes” beep] Is something bothering you?
Left foot? [“No” beep] Check his… let me see now… yeah, his right foot.
Then there should be no pain. Is it a tingling sensation? [“No” beep] Is it itching? [“Yes” beep]
Itchy foot means liver failure.
I didn't say "failing," I said "failure." Just like you. Liver's like a cruise ship taking on water. As it starts to sink, it sends out an S.O.S. Only instead of radio waves, it uses enzymes. The more enzymes in the blood, the worse the liver is. And once the ship has sunk, there's no more S.O.S. You think the liver's fine, but it's already at the bottom of the sea.
Now we just need to know what's causing the liver failure.
Oh, God, if only Taub had said that, it would've been a happy ending. Do a biopsy to confirm.
Rat pee. Very nice idea. Who came up with it?
Good. [Taub leaves.] You okay with him claiming the credit?
If he did, he'd have hung a "mission accomplished" banner in my outer office.
The fact that he stole your idea means that he cares enough to lie. That's all I needed to know. Rat pee. That's a very nice idea.
No, I didn't. So either I have a hole in my pocket —
You underestimate the entertainment value of your obsessions.
You had no right to invade my privacy. [He reaches under Lee’s pillow and pulls out a recorder.]
Yeah. It's irony.
Suddenly, you're not so fascinating. [He leaves.]
Prioritize, Wilson. Is that what you really want to torture me about right now?
Yeah. Whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time. Maybe I'll discover that my childhood wasn't perfect.
Not much credit to take, because I'm not going back.
[fiddling with his phone] Delete contact.
Don't beat yourself up. I'm not going back because it doesn't work. [He enters the elevator and pushes the key to confirm the delete.]
I will give you 30 reasons, one for each pound that cause the apnea which enflamed the epiglottis. Why is our rainbow coalition missing brown and bi?
Reason 31 — whatever whacked the husband’s heart is also whacking her airway and… Oh, good. I thought maybe Kutner was home nursing the rib you broke when you elbowed your way in for credit on the last patient.
Interesting. Not about the patient. That was kinda dull. I thought maybe you were lying to cover for Kutner which sounds noble. Except you’re doing it out of guilt instead of love.
Would have jumped to the husband and finished off him and his lame immune system.
Start her on IV fluids and acyclovir.
How sweet. They can die together instead of separately, 40 years apart.
Or he could have just had an adrenaline surge when he saw his chance to hit the singles market. Send her home.
I thought she was just flirting with me. [Mother gives him a look and daughter stares blankly at him.] I can fix it, but it’s gonna cost you… $3.75. I’m not just gonna give you my coffee. [He hands his cup to the daughter.] Think of it as Costa Rican sober juice.
That little minty scent hiding beneath the rose petal perfume and the cherry blossom moisturizer and the morning dew hair spray. You sneak into mommy’s bathroom and gulp some of her mouthwash?
You spit it out?
Win some, lose some. And strictly speaking, since he’s not my patient, win some. Look at the time. It’s half past “Taub was lying about Kutner.”
Find out what or who he’s doing. Either way, Cuddy’s gonna want me to write it under “reason for termination.”
He didn’t say anything? To any of you? Family problems? Bad relationship? Financial pressures?
Parents are ancient history.
He didn’t slit his wrists and… peacefully drift away. He shot himself. He didn’t leave a note. That means panic. Which could have been preempted if the idiots who worked alongside him for 80 hours a week had seen this coming.
[shakes head slightly] Just trying to figure it out.
No. 25% of suicidal people have friends who didn’t notice anything and don’t want to feel guilty.
You can’t be in denial about Kutner and the husband.
Well, call the tabloids. Tell them you just witnessed the miracle of slightly increased kidney function.
And the next one too? The one after that? How many files till it’s okay that Kutner’s dead? [pause] Cardiac enzymes means she didn’t have a heart attack. No vision problems means no mitochondrial disease.
Polyserositis fits. Start her on indomethacin. [He heads for his office, followed by Cuddy.]
I’m fine. Despite what Wilson will say.
Pretty sure he has mah-jongg Tuesday mornings. I assume he thinks I will work through this better if I don’t have to keep flicking his wings off my shoulder.
I know his fantasy football team cratered. Figured he’d gotten over it.
Thanks. But it’s not my loss.
Patient’s membranes aren’t gonna heal themselves.
I’ll join you. [He takes a Vicodin.]
It was his name. He was conflicted, didn’t know where he fit in, being ripped out of his world and stuck into yours.
It’s hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when everyone sees you as Lawrence Kutner.
Then you should have said no.
All his Anglo name gave him was the illusion that he was someone he wasn’t. You were being emotional, not rational. You didn’t understand him.
You wanted to make him happy by shutting out his pain. When he looked happy, you assumed the pain had gone. It just got buried deeper, leaving him tormented about who he was until finally he put a bullet —
I’m sorry about your son.
You haven’t asked if I learned anything relevant from the Kutners.
Or you’re afraid there is something relevant. Which would mean you could have saved him.
Good thing you got some. Or you’d have tried again and gotten it right.
If it doesn’t fit any diagnosis, it just leaves one diagnosis.
I’m Dr. House. You have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His heart is too weak. Yours is too strong. Good news is it’s fixable. We induce a massive heart attack and kill off the extra muscle.
It’s only dangerous if your heart is normal size. But since all the —
No. This is actually very annoying and I’m getting really bored of lying to patients to scare them into telling me the truth. [to Eddie] She’s faking. And yes, if she keeps faking I’m going to eventually do something that will kill her.
That was real. Treatment made her better. But good for her was bad for you which was bad for her. So she made herself bad. It’s all so simple. She figured the sicker she was, the longer you’d hang on.
Oh, please. People hate reruns.
What, you pinky swear or you just plain swear? Because —
She can’t.
So, what can shred an epiglottis and make muscle disappear?
Mourning period’s over. Foreman’s sense of irony is back. I was wrong about the ethnic reason. Step one — change your name back. Step two — if step one fails — move to Bangalore. Step fourteen, if step thirteen doesn’t work, kill yourself.
I’ve been polite to the friends I’ve called. All of whom were useless.
Tomato, tomah-to.
[to Foreman and Thirteen] You two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm MS. [to Taub] And you, run the echo on Eddie that you’re planning to do behind my back to see if his heart’s improving.
Did you let me hire a pervert?
Kutner’s police background check from when he started. He was charged with indecent exposure.
If he thought like me, he would know that living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it.
It’s only violating it if you find something. Good to see you.
He was hiding. Why?
[reading a card in a trophy case] “Colonial Warrior Blaster. Number One One.” He spent months tracking this down. He had passions.
He hung the bad with the good. [Looking photos in a twin frame — baby Kutner with his biological parents and him graduating college with his adoptive ones.] His loss beside a reminder of what he’d gained. Means he was open about the pain. Should mean that if it got worse, he had no reason to hide it.
What am I missing? [to Wilson] You’ve got that look. You figured this out.
What if I didn’t miss anything ‘cause there’s nothing to miss? He didn’t kill himself. He was murdered.
Took up Cuddy’s offer of time off. Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.
Her muscles wouldn’t have atrophied. You run the echo on the husband?
I prefer the less subtle answer: You were right, House. So… Less time proving why hubby isn’t dead, more time proving why Kutner is. [He turns the white board which around to face them.] Motives for murder.
They investigated what they saw, not what they didn’t saw. Talk to friends, classmates, pizza delivery guy. And draft Foreman. He can make calls through his tears.
Is that “No, I’m not calling my boyfriend, who apparently called my boss instead of me to say he wasn’t coming in?” ‘Cause it’s really not fair to have that much subtext in one syllable.
You’re not remotely curious?
She could have alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency. Run her AAT proteins.
It wasn’t hard to figure out that his password was Kutner. He did what they tell you not to do.
But his parents were. And the guy who killed them is coming up for parole.
Kutner testified at every one of his hearings. The guy wouldn’t be the first to see the clock ticking.
Which he bought years ago, obviously for self-defense.
Right. The murderer would never try to make it look like suicide. That would be unethical. [Cuddy stands up to leave] You haven’t asked about my patient.
Means you checked up to see that I’m still on it. You wanna transfer the case but you won’t because you think it’s the only thing that’s holding me together. Relax. Either I’m right or I’m wrong. We’ll know soon enough.
So, thanks to her idiotic move, she’s dead in 24 hours if she doesn’t get a new liver.
How does that disagree with what I just said?
What do you know. It is myelofibrosis. [He starts writing on the paper.] Says so right here. Who wants to tell Cuddy?
Just twice.
I don’t quite see how that’s relevant. [His pager goes off. He checks it.] Cheese it. It’s the coppers.
Technically, he’s not our patient. So I’m really only leaving her to die.
Absolutely. [He goes to his desk and picks up his phone] Don’t worry. This is why God gave me two ears.
Wow. If only he were here to say that. I’m sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, “Hey, the dead guy won’t mind if we’re wasting —”
Need an incurable romantic to talk to an incurable romantic.
You deduced that by removing your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?
[shows Cameron two films. He points at the first one] Needs a liver. Has a liver. [He points at the second film.] He can make a partial donation. The faster he agrees, the faster she gets to not die.
Nice symmetry, huh?
If he’s gonna do this, he’s gonna do this for love. I though he should talk to someone who spoke the language.
Only if he said no. But your urgent hovering means he said yes.
Or you sprinkled too much wishful thinking in your tea.
Go back to the ER. My thanks to you and your cold feet.
Except you’re wrong.
The guy who killed Kutner’s parents died of an aneurism two months ago.
Bad news. Love can’t save you. On the other hand, mold can. [He hooks a stool with his cane, rolls it to the bedside and sits.] Your heart failure was caused by a fungal infection called cardiac blastomycosis. It started as nodules in your lungs which every doc, except one, mistook for cancer. It’s very rare, very curable. I’m starting you on itraconazole.
Your emotional state bumped your catecholamines which helped raise your prolactin.
Three months of treatment, you’ll be back to your buff, chiseled self.
But you’d be trading the certainty that you’ll live for the uncertainty that she’ll live.
Now you get to be nicer to your next wife.
I was yesterday too.
Not really. Not legally.
The idiot is gonna do this with or without us. This way we can protect the organ.
So we strap him to the bed, wait till his wife dies?
I should fire you.
And a full two or three hours to figure it out.
She would have lung issues.
No skin or GI problems. [He sighs] What is she hiding?
[angry] Either we have all the clues and we’re idiots or we don’t have all the clues.
Both.
Bad lie. Did you really think the beaches in Hawaii were just like the beaches in Rio? The disease bearing sand flies are completely different.
Who’d you go with?
I don’t actually need to know who it was. I just need to know that you went so we can know that you have visceral leishmaniasis. But since Lancelot there was ready to die for you, he might want the answer to both.
[to Taub on his way out] Start her on antimony and have Cuddy find her a liver. [He looks back at Eddie who is trying to come to grips with this information.] They were ready to die. But for guilt, not love.
No, you weren’t.
And you’re romanticizing. Again.
No one saw it coming.
Unless you feel there’s more to do here to cure me, don’t you have a funeral to go to?
Interesting. Almost as interesting as you trying to step into Kutner’s shoes just days after he stepped out of them.
Now who’s trying to get her hybrid waxed? We need to do a vestibular caloric test. See if the balance problem starts above or below the neck. [The team starts to get up.] And when I say “we,” I mean “you.” You’re the one with the favor to repay, not them.
Cameron just brought me a case.
I say it’s not my grindstone she’s after. And not her nose she wants on it. She and Chase are practically living together. What did you just order?
Since when do you pass on the swine? And wheat toast? Might as well eat a sheet of sandpaper.
Your bro’s nurse not lovin’ the love handles?
He’s no longer on my team. I’m sorry he’s no longer on my team. Nothing else to talk about.
[displaying the watch] Five functions, including a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to ask me if I’m okay.
Not hungry. [He takes a Vicodin.]
She changed her shoes. If he was faking, he’d have vomited on the other side of the bed.
Do a Holter and a carotid Doppler. See if his heart skips for more than the spotted owl. [The team turns to leave] Although I didn’t say “we.” If I had… {Cameron leaves instead.]
Nice. I’m hooked. You can get back to your shift at the ER. Except, as far as the ER is concerned, you’re on vacation, right?
Explains why you ditched Chase and came to differentials, not why you ran the tests.
Well, I’m not your boss, as you usually take great pleasure in pointing out. Hey, you don’t still have the hots for me, do you?
Was Florence Nightingale. Yeah. You’re gonna nurse us back to spiritual and mental oneness. That would make sense if we were having this conversation a week ago.
The problem is, I think neither. Because neither makes sense. The only thing that does… doesn’t.
What she said.
It could, if Cameron hadn’t already CT’d his head. Empty as her boyfriend’s calendar.
[at the same time] Not sure yet.
Better theory than he’s faking it. The clogs have it. Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.
God, I hope that’s a euphemism.
I’m trying to figure out what that could be a euphemism for. [Taub sighs] You’ll find a way. [Cameron sighs]
Sorry, I’m just the Zone delivery guy.
His history said the environmental kamikaze was single.
Yeah. No worries there.
You must really love your husband and travel by rickshaw. It only took you 18 hours to get here. [He puts a forkful of Wilson’s lunch in his mouth and makes a very disgusted face.] Who eats kale? It’s so bland it doesn’t even taste like kale.
I have no idea. I know he’s an idiot. And now I’ve learned that he’s a liar. So we’re making a — [As he gets ready to toss Wilson’s lunch in the trash, he stops and stares at it.] Who told you I was in here?
I got it figured out.
[indicating Cameron] I was talking to her. You’re not even supposed to be here.
What? Oh, I don’t care what you do with him. You’re not doing a favor for a doctor in Philly. You’re doing a favor for an oncologist in North Jersey.
Spying, preemptive grief counseling.
Good points. Also doesn’t explain the diet.
Nothing. Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag. Or did you keep your maiden name?
Yep. Got a kid too. Double threat. Eco-freak and deadbeat dad.
It’s not just a spasm. It’s swollen. [He pushes on the bulges which make a slight crinkly sound.] Crunchy.
So, what causes loss of balance, pathological hiccups, and a hole in his Gloria Steinem?
No. His A.C.E. levels were normal.
Start him on IV methyl-prednisolone for systemic sclerosis. Do a full work-up to confirm.
Without yourself. [to the team] Grab a bat. [to Cameron] Grab some pine. Time to bring in the first string.
You obviously want to be here. I can’t figure out why. I wanna see where you go when you can’t be here. [He watches her leave.]
Didn’t ask you to dinner.
Hmmm. Inviting me to search your kitchen. Means that you know that I’d find nothing. Or that you know I’d find something so you’re hoping that I’m going to assume the former and I won’t bother to look. [He heads into the kitchen]
Your single omelet theory conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll you had for lunch today. Vegetable and grain gag-athon.
You’re not getting any fatter. Your medical records were clean.
You’re alone tonight, so it’s Kutner.
Your patients live, your patients die. You float above it all like a medical colossus. But a fellow doctor dies…
Mortality is mortality.
Stuff you haven’t eaten just proves you haven’t eaten it.
I assume they were checking for vascular pulsations. Either it’s negative or he’s a big wuss.
[winces and hold the phone away from his ear] Metabolic bone disease?
That explains the pain. Odds are it’s a subclinical infection that we made worse with the steroids we gave him. Start him on IV antibiotics. X-ray his legs to confirm osteomyelitis.
The infection obviously flared. Do ‘em again. [He closes his phone to the sound of Doug still screaming.]
[drinking something to wash down the pill] Which leaves cancer.
Which means it’s not bone cancer.
Tell Chase to repair the break. You two prep him for chemo.
Nope. I wanna blast him for with chemo for a cancer that explains the symptoms.
Still enjoying your day off, I see.
The more interesting question is why do you care?
What I mean is, why do you care from here? You can monitor the patient from home. What’s the difference between here and home?
Any other differences? Hmm… there’s less medical equipment, more training bras, and more Vegemite sandwiches. Actually, technically, right now, Chase is here. But that’s because I called him, and you didn’t know that. And it’s irrelevant to my point. Which is… You and Chase are over.
You decided that his single drawer of clothes is one drawer too many. But you don’t have the guts to tell him. So… You’re emotionally walking away instead of actually walking away. Which is stupid ‘cause only one of those is good for your heart.
And you want to say no. So I circle right back to his single drawer of clothes —
Oh.
You guys have a hot tub?
She must go to the gym a lot.
Then maybe when you travel on business you zip on down to that complimentary hotel spa.
Sorry, did you just say yes?
Sorry. I’m sure she’s got a medical crisis. And I need more time to figure out some leading questions for your wife.
She doesn’t want back on my team and she doesn’t want to jump me.
Wha, wha, wha, what? You ask a question. I rule out two possibilities and you’re satisfied? That means you don’t want an answer. You just wanted to know there wasn’t a particular answer. Either you were worried that she wanted back on my team, or you were worried that she wanted back on me.
Could be. A lot of STDs hang in the balance. [He turns back to the door but Cuddy has left. He sighs.] I give up. Vinegar compresses four times a day. Any chance I could just leave it at that? [The husband glares.] No. Pseudomonas folliculitis. It’s a skin infection from crowded and contaminated hot tubs, which you obviously use, but not with your husband. [The wife looks guilty. House whispers to her] Tried to help a sister out.
Means it’s gotta be cancer.
Biopsies can be wrong. Symptoms can’t.
Sure you can. Prep him for total body irradiation.
Not unless you think the cancer’s cleverly hiding outside his body.
[getting in the elevator] You’d rather do nothing, just let him die on his own?
[thinks] His idea is better. Pour away.
I lost my mojo.
I was clueless about Kutner. I was wrong about Cameron. Taub just came up with an idea that I should have seen long before he did.
And I have no idea why you’re eating carrots.
I’m losing my mind. All you got to say is “good”?
Loss of balance. Pathological hiccups. Air leak between the lungs. Broken femur. Now tachycardia. Go! [Silence] Come on, give me something. Give me a bad idea. Maybe I can turn it into a good one. [Silence] Fine. Open him up and put in a defibrillator.
Redo all the tests. In the meantime, open him up, put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the tests. [The team leaves.]
Balance, organs, nerves, lungs, bones, heart.
[sits on steps with a sigh] There’s no sign of infection. It’s not a metabolic or autoimmune disease. It’s definitely not cancer. I think.
[indicating the vending machine] Aren’t you going to pick?
You already put your money in. You never do that until you decide.
There’s nothing healthy in that machine.
Gummi bears. You hate gummi bears.
No. And more importantly, I hate them.
You manipulative bitch. [Wilson’s smile gets much broader.] You’re not suddenly eating healthy because you want to. You’re eating healthy because you know I don’t want to. I’ve been mooching food for ten years. [He stands.] Now, either it suddenly started bothering you this week or you’re —
[admiringly] You manipulative bitch.
[entering] Hi! Got a few questions.
A hopefully pointless medical procedure. Your life and my mojo hang in the balance. Pesticides are evil, which means that commercial flowers are doused in evil. But plant life is nature’s answer to evil. So you have a garden.
A window box, then.
[grasping at a straw] Potted plants?
Yeah, yeah. They’re evil. Yeah, got it.
[to Taub] Your marriage sucks.
All marriages suck. [to Doug and Franni] Your marriage sucks.
He loves a tree in Oregon more than he loves you. But he can’t have sex with it. Unless it’s that slutty oak outside Portland.
She’s had enough. She’s gonna leave. Or maybe she’s jut not putting out. Whatever. You gotta make it right, right away. You gotta compromise that precious flower principle.
Roses? [Doug nods.] Yes. You have sporotrichosis. It’s an infection from the thorn of the rose which, by any other name, is still a cheap marital aid.
Lesion on your eighth cranial nerve knocks out your balance. Another on your phrenic nerve gives you serial hiccups. We then spread it to your bones and heart with steroids and insulin-like growth factor.
It’s good news for him. It’s good news for future generations. It’s crappy news for you. He’s gonna be fine. And he’ll never doubt himself again.
Damn. I was hoping I would interrupt something. [He closes the door on the patient and tosses a file on the exam table.] Your favor’s repaid. Patient’s cured. He’s already packing for another Earth Day extravaganza next week.
People only change after trauma if they wanted to change before the trauma. Or if they’ve watched too many afterschool specials.
I’m talking about you. You lost husband number one. No surprise that the death of a colleague would make you question another long-term lease.
Absolutely. You want him to dump you. It’s totally different. Much less guilt. Either way, you’re out of reasons to avoid him. Kutner was a pretty dumb one to begin with. [He leaves, closing the door behind him.]
[without opening his eyes] That insight would be a lot more impressive if you weren’t just a product of my exhausted brain.
Curious why no French maid’s outfit. No spanky pants.
It’s insomnia. Four nights without REM sleep can cause—
Probably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom.
Who cares why you’re here. A decent night’s sleep, you won’t be.
Addictive substances are no substitute for nature’s healing balm. [He takes a Vicodin] Make this fast. I need to sleep.
Exploding head syndrome. Cool. Well, obviously his brain knows how to hear.
[glances at her then back at the chart] Mom’s signature’s on everything. Did Dad die?
So we’re left with temporal lobe seizure.
Could have just looked like a bad shot to the leg. Put him in the seizure lab. See if his head blows up all over again.
I need a scrip for sleeping pills. My neighbor’s dog’s been keeping me awake and seems strangely invulnerable to poison. [Wilson puts the file on the table and goes to his desk.] Why is the soon-to-be-second-prettiest Dr. Chase here?
Wedding in two weeks? I’d say you were pregnant but I don’t think Chase’s body is mature enough to produce sperm.
Interesting case?
Ho! No wonder his prostate’s enlarged. It’s full of pool cues and cigars. [The folder holds flyers from various venues.]
No retired ministers available to plan it?
So she says. Luckily, there are people in this world ready to stand up for what’s right.
Listen. There are two things I do well. Bachelor parties rank… towards the top.
The limp leading the blind.
So exploding head syndrome plus vision loss.
[grabbing the bottle] Knock yourselves out. [He goes into one of the treatment rooms, shuts the door and leans against it.] How did I know he was gonna go blind? [Nothing] Don’t get cute, Gazoo. You’re in my mind. You’re obviously there.
That’s a lot clearer than “the limp leading the blind.”
It was a long shot. I don’t even remember the c-reactive protein level.
How high is K2?
Me neither. But I read a book about it years ago. Fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, bending over—
Cool. An all-access pass to my own brain.
Why?
What does it look like I’m doing? Fighting the power.
[removing the glasses and turning off the boom box] It’s a new symptom. Neuropathy.
Case got interesting.
Like the zoo. Except you can bang on the glass as much as you want.
Good question.
Tell me about it.
Juggling. No, pins. Three pins. Patient was pinned in his last three matches. Leading up to that he was 15 and 0. I figured his balance was off from diminished sensation.
That we missed on the head CT?
He just went up a weight class three months ago.
Actually, increased ICP could make sense.
I was processing.
His deafness. What if it was caused by NF2 cancer instead of his childhood meningitis?
Or a byproduct of the cancer suppressing his immune system. MRI his head.
You two… doing anything?
Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle could still indicate a tumor.
You’re not on the guest list. Bachelor parties are an ancient and sacred male rite of passage.
She’s the one that got me hooked in with Madoff.
Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnostic theory because it’s difficult to prove. Do a biopsy. We need to take a better look at his fourth ventricle.
[exhales] Okay. [He gathers up Seth’s films.]
[entering] My patient’s brain now… versus three years ago. [he puts films on the light board.] See any difference? [to Chase] Is he telling you to avoid the party?
Sure. Don’t come. If you want your wedding vows to be meaningless.
You are going to commit to that one special woman forever. Which is beautiful. But if your commitment the day after the wedding is the same as your commitment the day before, then the wedding meant nothing. So, and I see no logical way around this, if you want your marriage to matter, you have to be a wanton, trolling, muck-covered pig the day before.
Evidence of NF2, right?
[opening the door] That whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.
Okay.
Why go back to that well? In the nine years since Wilson’s party, a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers.
What made you remember the stripper loved cats?
[turning on the intercom with his cane] Just rehearsing for the revival of Evita. What’d you find?
He’s okay with that.
[thinks then turns on intercom] Why are you closing? Supposed to put in a cochlear implant.
Really? Well, someone must have screwed up. I’ll go track it down.
That’s a great idea. Let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open.
I have been known to lie to serve my own agenda. An implant does absolutely nothing to help me diagnose him.
If he still doesn’t want it, after having time to adjust, I’ll take it out. I’ll blind him too if he wants to experience that culture.
Kid’s just had brain surgery. He’s not stable.
No problem. [to Ellie] You’re not mad.
Not mad enough. You wanted your son to hear. You just didn’t have the guts to make him get the implant.
Because he is ignorant and he’s being raised by an idiot.
[shouting] My patient is opting into a handicap! It’s an insult to all the other gimps out there.
That’s the arrangement? [she nods slightly] Okay.
Yeah, about that…
I’m not sure. [they enter the elevator] I’m not even sure why we did it.
To you, maybe.
Huh. I figured by now you’d be at the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.
Why did I give a human being the power of hearing? You ask God the same question, he’ll give you the same answer.
I agree.
Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you’re in charge.
Why aren’t you in my office?
I did something insane, and you’re not all over me analyzing why.
I gave that idiot an implant to prove to him what an idiot he’s been. How is that nice?
I know.
[opening the door] What choice do I have? [He and Amber leave]
Not before hosing Epstein-Barr off the table. Now eat up. We’re gonna pick out the ice cream flavors for the bachelor party. [He sticks a spoon in each container. They each taste some.]
Well, it would be stupid if it tasted like bourbon. That’s the brown one.
Flash frozen in a secret process. Guy figured it out in his basement. [He swallows a spoonful of yellow ice cream] Limoncello. Genius.
[long pause] It’s his heart. [He looks at the team. They’re back to normal] Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.
What the hell just happened? Everything started to fade away.
Is your eyesight better than mine?
Excellent topic choice. Surgery’s so boring and my lying to you is just so yesterday.
But you, on the other hand—
So… I need to cancel the fart band?
Spoken like a true Aussie. By the way, if you know where I can get me the sheet music to Waltzing Matilda… [Chase starts to leave] Hey. Want some ice cream? We’re having a sundae bar. [He tosses Chase a pint.]
Sundae or bar?
With a “K.”
[burps loudly] And then I have a clever response. [He opens another can.]
The heart was fine during this test. The arrhythmia’s hiding.
Or, the arrhythmia is hiding. We need to stress him. Put the patient on a treadmill.
I value your opinion. I value rejecting your opinion.
Cuddy doesn’t actually want you in charge. She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.
How do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman’s sign-off.
Focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it’s not simulated?
That’s a tough sell since she never leaves the room for more than five minutes.
Revealing the arrhythmia. [whispers] Nice idea.
Look at that. Arrhythmia.
The correct phrasing would be, “I should always listen to you.”
Go.
You sure I did this at Wilson’s party?
And it worked?
[trying to stay ahead of the flames] Not right now!
Are you going somewhere with this? Because this feels—
[has finally put out the fire. He thinks] Heat. See, if you hadn’t been here that would have just popped into my head. Which actually would have been way cooler. [He takes out his phone and dials] Foreman. The kid’s got Uhthoff Phenomenon. Which means it’s MS. Start him on double-dose interferon. [He hangs up]
Not before I’ve added “chemical burns” to this guy’s cause of death.
Allow me to welcome you to the best night of your life. [He pours the flaming alcohol into a tumbler.]
Now, ah, a few ground rules for the evening. Uh, safety is job one. We’ve now gone for 18 days without an injury in the workplace. [The door opens and Wilson slowly walks in. He looks around while House speaks. Foreman and Thirteen clink glasses and drink.] Uh, yes, these girls are all working their way through law school. Don’t test them.
[smiling as he leans past the glasses so he can see Wilson] I knew you couldn’t stay away.
Clearly, reality begs to differ.
Out back somewhere.
Eh. I kinda like it in here.
And the blindness and neuropathy and arrhythmia and anything else we did. [they drink] What exactly did my team do?
Use the other bathroom. It’s in the kitchen. Looks like a sink.
Is he okay?
[quietly] Okay. [long pause] I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn’t I? [Amber shrugs slightly] That’s why you wanted Karamel at this party.
I knew about her body butter. I knew about his strawberry allergy. I tried to kill Chase. Why would I do that? I don’t want Cameron.
Hello. [pause] You confirm? [pause] Thanks. [hangs up] That kid we saved… He’s dying. It’s not MS. We were wrong.
I need to sleep. [He enters the apartment and closes the door in Amber’s face.]
You tried to kill Chase. I need to push you back down. You’re dangerous. [his cell phone rings]
Not answering. [he answers on the second ring] Hello?
Foreman’s dying patient.
It’s not eosinophilic pneumonitis. I gotta crash.
I can’t.
Good night. [He hangs up and picks up his cane.]
I need sleeping pills. I was gonna hit up Wilson but he’s not answering his phone.
[looks at Amber guiltily] Pills.
It wasn’t eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it?
Good.
I haven’t slept through the night since Kutner killed himself.
You tried to kill Chase.
No, you don’t. I acknowledge my subconscious exists. Now go away.
I’m taking a personal day.
I love ballet but, as someone may have mentioned, I’m taking a personal day.
[following Foreman into the vestibule] Hold on.
STD?
No.
What about a pulmonary contusion?
B.U.N. and creatinine are elevated but within range…
Dehydration could hide an infection. Go treat her for the obvious. IV fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.
Well, now it’s open for a reason. We need to talk.
Then you’ll obviously need a moment to process.
I’m hallucinating.
I need you to sit in on my differentials, double-check everything I do.
It’s gotta be sleep apnea. I get a good night’s sleep and I still feel exhausted. Lack of delta sleep can lead to hallucinations.
I don’t think so.
No.
Nope.
Yeah! That one!
Enough! [Both Amber and Wilson stop talking.] Don’t give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.
Someone who’s not actually here. Beyond that seems irrelevant.
Kutner.
You gonna help me or not?
[to Wilson] Can’t sleep with you here.
Do you see someone standing beside me?
Then, no. [Amber is standing next to him.]
So run a test to confirm it’s pneumonia.
Trans-tracheal aspiration.
Regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?
So what’s the problem?
No. Our patient can’t breathe. Either do the test or come up with a better one. [Foreman leaves. House hands Wilson a list on the back of an envelope] So, we’re down to infection, trauma, MS, schizophrenia, pills.
That’s why it’s further down the list. We can confirm an infection with a simple blood test.
[handing a blood drawing kit to Wilson] Can’t do this on my own.
Focus on the lungs.
We know it’s not lung cancer. It could be a liver tumor, eats through to the lungs. Get an ultrasound of her liver. If you find masses, get a biopsy.
I don’t think it is a symptom. I think we caused it.
I prescribed antibiotics.
Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.
Where the hell were you?
Ballerina has toxic epidermal necrolysis.
About to be.
I feel guilty.
I have no reason to feel guilty. It doesn’t make any sense. Unless there’s something wrong in the limbic area of my brain.
It’s consistent with MS. And, since the blood tests were negative… I have to apologize. If I feel better then you’re right, I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing, it means my limbic brain is shot.
I’m Doctor House. Anyone explain to you your status?
I’m sorry. I treated you for an infection before confirming that you had one. That’s why you lost your skin. I know you’re in pain. I know that I caused it. I’m sorry.
[thinks then shakes his head] Nothing.
I meant it. Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm?
I think skinless women are hot. Do a trans-jugular liver biopsy. If she bleeds, at least it stays in her veins. [He looks at Wilson]
No. [Foreman leaves] I felt nothing. It’s MS.
In order to make you feel better.
You were looking for cancer. I thought it would be helpful for [he gestures toward Wilson]
Yes. Which you reported to me five seconds ago. Thought I’d let him finish his hors d’oeuvres before getting the bouncer to take care of him.
No!
Wilson. Get out.
Do I need your approval to throw you out? [Wilson leaves] You happy now?
Are you saying we should kill her?
If we stopped her heart we could get our pictures and then restart it.
Then she stays dead.
Yeah.
We’re gonna stop her heart so I can MRI it. I think it was her idea. Pneumonia was her idea and almost killed my patient.
Kutner was secretly a woman. That’s why he killed himself. [Wilson waits] It’s Amber.
Yeah. The irrational part of my brain works like the rational part of yours. How about that.
Who cares? I’ve got competing ideas. They can’t both be right.
So is it regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?
Nothing that anyone in my head has come up with.
Great. [starts to leave, turns back] You get the LP results back?
I need the pills.
It could still be schizophrenia.
I know.
I’d prefer something that could actually work.
Don’t give me the cancer voice, that overly earnest tone.
Worse? Double-death?
I have an idea.
Insulin shock.
Could work.
I’ve had no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting. None of the symptoms of Vicodin overdose.
I’ve been popping pills for years. I’ve only been seeing things for days. Something changed.
So, we’re no longer dealing in absolutes.
Actually, if you could be up here in two, that’d be really helpful.
Because I’m about to put myself into insulin shock.
You’re only scared because you know this is going to work. [He injects the insulin in his left forearm]
Yes. [He begins to seize.]
It worked. Where are my pants?
She’s been everywhere I’ve been for days. [House sits on the edge of the gurney with his (scarless) right thigh showing. He pulls on his pants while Wilson tosses his jeans on the gurney.] She’s not here, ergo…
Now who’s being biased? You wanted me to detox as much as I wanted… [stops dressing] Forgot how to do my zipper.
You don’t seem to annoy me as usual. I’m not sure that’s a deficit. [zips pants] And, I’m all better.
Absolutely. I can feel myself repressing all kinds of icky things. I check out, don’t I? [Wilson shrugs as House’s beeper goes off. He checks it] Damn.
Any brain damage?
Obviously had more time.
I assume we can’t kill her again and take more pictures.
Good one.
See, the problem with speculation is you make a speck out of you and some guy named “Lation” which really doesn’t affect me at all.
Which just leaves…
I don’t know yet.
Nothing changes. [pause] I just had an epiphany. All by myself. Popped into my head out of nothing.
He’s too devoted.
Right. I’m being cynical. People can care because they care, not because they cheated. Theoretically true. But gonorrhea fits better.
Tested her blood.
That’s not where her problem is. Gonorrhea disseminated to her heart. Got walled off in an abscess, it’d be invisible.
No need to test her again when we can check Prince Charming. Once you confirm, cut the abscess out of her heart.
Thank you, Molly. And another beer when you get the chance. I’m celebrating.
Thank goodness. [MMMBop is heard. House pulls out his cell phone.] Don’t tell me, I was right.
And everyone’s a winner.
Don’t think so.
Lying would fit too.
I saw guilt in him. If he’s not actually guilty, then I wasn’t right. I was lucky.
And if I was just lucky…
Wilson. Come get me.
Thanks.
How many shirts do I need?
It’s probably Foreman.
Patient okay?
Why don’t I feel scared?
I feel like crap. My life if falling apart, but I don’t feel scared. Not of the rehab, anyway.
It won’t work.
What do I do if my only option won’t work?
Hmm. It’s either that or electroshock every six hours. Good night, Wilson.
I quit.
You can go suckle the little bastard child who makes you feel good about yourself.
I’m hallucinating.
Ruled out everything else.
I’ll cheat, scam, find some way to keep using.
These people don’t know me. You do.
I need you.
Yeah. That’ll be better. [He watches her leave then leans across the couch to open a decorative box on the end table.]
[His eyes are watering. He’s shivering. His hand has a major tremor. He can barely speak.] Coffee cup. On the top shelf.
There’s more.
My shoes in the closet.
False alarm.
That’s your advice? Drink this?
You know what would calm the nausea? Vicodin. Marijuana. A coma. [He sees a lone Vicodin on the floor, past the bath mat.]
Too bitter. I already have enough bitter.
No! No!
Can you stop? The breathing.
Then use your nose.
And after?
And what if I can’t?
You’re telling me what I want to hear. With no evidence.
With no evidence.
Neither are you. [Cuddy looks surprised.] I’m your hospital’s biggest asset.
That’s why you’re here. That’s why you’re lying to me about…
Sure you have. [He props himself up, interested in the puzzle] Which means that you just said that because you want to tell me what you lied to me about twenty years ago.
Am I wrong?
You sat next to me. I cheated off you in the midterm.
Why would you…?
We’re alone.
No, I mean Amber. She’s gone.
Thank you.
I always want to kiss you.
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley. Ding, ding ding hmm hmm hmm. Just warning you — I’m in a good mood. And largely pain free. So I have no idea how things are going —
Set off by a stroke? Or is there a pony in the backyard?
Is making life miserable. Non-logical thinkers often do.
Most people who have this operation don’t even notice they’re missing anything. Left brain has language, arithmetic, rationality. Right brain is a mute loser.
Yes. And where would junior high be without our ability to judge people on aesthetics?
It’s a universal daisy chain of peace and love that throws buns at people.
Good morning, sunshine. We got a brand new toy. You wanna play?
Great. I love euphemisms. By euphemism I mean when you say something and it means something else. [He closes the file and drops it on the table before following Cuddy to his office.] Begin eliminating. Search the home.
The, uh… [He gestures at her high-necked blouse.] Isn’t that like locking the barn door after the horse has put his face between your breasts for an hour and a half?
Well, I’m not normally into role-playing, but if you wanna… [He approaches her. She backs up slightly.]
So this isn’t you freaking out over last night.
I slept with Cuddy. After she helped me detox from Vicodin. I’ve been clean for almost 24 hours now. [Wilson stares at him. House waits a moment.] Okay. Thought I’d mention it. [He gets up to leave.]
That’s what she said. A ha ha ha.
She’s probably got some bruising…
I feel better than I did four hours ago. Four hours from now, I’ll feel better than this.
Clean and sober and hot.
Several good options. Unfortunately I don’t think she’s gonna give me the pleasure. She left before I woke up, and five minutes ago she told me that I’m just an employee.
Yes.
You think she jumped me out of pity?
Absolutely. [He leaves]
Wilson says we need to talk.
I agree. [He takes her picture.] This has clearly gotten past the talking stage. [He leaves, pivoting by the door to take two more pictures.]
Could be our tax dollars at work, constantly building new roadways and bridges. [He puts the lipstick in his jacket pocket.] A meningioma. Slow growing. Could extend along the subosteal layer of the cranial cavity and be hidden by the bone.
Proof.
If I talked, she’d have lied. I’d have lied. And though two negatives make a positive, I thought thermal-imaging photos seemed simpler. Note how many more heated areas appear after less than a minute with me.
Don’t talk to her.
Manipulation is in your genetic code. You think I’m making a mistake, you move in to correct it.
She lied to me. Either last night or today. I need to find out which and why.
So far.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the left hemisphere… The side that’s obsessed with finding answers. The one that needs things to make sense. The interpreter. That’s where we tell the story of who we are and why we do things.
I’ll send it tickets to a Phillies game.
But he is cold. [He leaves the observation area and goes to Scott.] Why are you scratching?
Ammonia breath. [He opens Scott’s gown.] Your liver is failing.
[enters, also drinking coffee] I want permission to do a liver biopsy. We’re looking for sarcoidosis.
What do you mean, fine?
Yes. [He puts his coffee cup on the desk]
Yes.
I’m blowing off my clinic hours.
Think I should stop and let the pain flood back?
Quite the opposite.
Great advice. You pretend that I’m gonna do that.
Didn’t you use to argue that my judgment would be better off drugs? Admit it. You’re curious why I want to make her angry.
You’re dying to know what I found in her coffee cup.
Oxytocin. [He goes into his office, followed by Wilson.]
Her lips say “no,” her hormones say “Oh, my God, yes. More!”
I paid the guy in the gym to retrieve one of her water bottles from the trash.
So, I need to make her lose her temper. Which breaks her delusion. Which demonstrates to me and to her that there’s something underneath this facade.
That’s outcome one. Outcome two is she kills me. I think it’s 50/50 right now.
I thought you’d say that.
Why is an old guy standing in my doorway?
She sent him. That’s gotta mean something.
Nice pants. [He gets up to leave, Eugene follows him.]
I’m tired of clinic duty. There’s only one thing that could cause squawking, right?
More air guitar?
And all the tests came up negative anyway, or you would have opened by telling me your brilliant diagnosis.
Or pancreatic cancer. Go scan his pancreas. And try Led Zeppelin.
There’s something wrong with this cup.
Or you could try making him angry. Standard choice number three.
I know how you could succeed.
Just say the magic words: “I will destroy my husband’s sperm.” [She gives him a look.] Oh, you mean succeed without doing that. Probably not.
[on his way out the door] If your condo rules don’t let you buy insurance, would you go homeless?
What, do you think I can fix this? We need to offer this guy something he can only get if he stays in the hospital — relationship counseling.
I mean his two hemispheres. That’s the breakfast of relationships — the most important one of the day. [He opens the door to Wilson’s office.] We need your special skills.
Say something.
“Talk to her.” The well isn’t deep, is it?
Your right brain likes what he’s saying. Hasn’t moved the entire scan.
Clotting could be a problem well before a solid tumor forms. It can still be pancreatic.
House.
What?
I assume Dr. Cuddy gave you this number.
I’m sorry but I’m about to lose you because I’m about to drive into a tunnel in a canyon on an airplane while hanging up the phone. [He hangs up] I might be getting some more phone calls, so let’s make it fast.
That’s right, pancreatic. I know it’s pancreatic. I know there’s evidence. I know I’ve seen it. I just can’t —
If the cancer’s too small to find, let’s make it easier. Let’s open him up and paint it. There’s a new procedure using scorpion toxin and infrared paint. Paint only works on the cancer cells. Makes ‘em easier to spot.
If I’m right about pancreatic cancer, the only chance he’s got is finding and removing those cancer cells now.
Relax. Our friendship is not doomed.
You’re worried that once I’m in a relationship, you and me’ll be over.
She look angry?
Oh, no.
[on the speaker, from the observation deck] You weren’t looking up at the right time.
The clots aren’t from cancer. They’re coming from his heart.
Not while we were looking. Didn’t I open with that? The clots were caused by an arrhythmia.
Not while we were looking! [He bangs on the glass of the observation deck.] Intermittent arrhythmia. This guy pulls our equipment off at the slightest provocation. We’d have to be watching at the exact moment it happened. Which I’m guessing from the way you two are scrambling around like idiots, is right now. [Chase glances up.] Yes. I’m saying do a transesophageal echo.
Absolutely. Right after the echo.
The heart looked healthy at the last echo and an arrhythmia wouldn’t cause clots in a healthy ventricle. So start with the left atrial appendage.
Yep. I did it again. Now get this poor guy’s BP under control and seal off the appendage. Then all we have to do is find out what damaged his heart before it goes after something he really needs.
So what damages a healthy 20-year-old heart enough to make it send out clots like it’s bombing Dresden?
Run a dexamethasone suppression test.
Why is there no lipstick on this cup? Cuddy was wearing lipstick when she drank from it. It was on my face. Why isn’t it on the cup?
Because in Houseland, and the rest of the universe, by the way, when a question presents itself, it calls for an answer.
What do I do?
You really think that was the best time to mock me?
I’ve been trying to make her angry for —
Attention! I have an announcement. As you go about your day, I would like you to be aware of the fact that I slept with Lisa Cuddy.
I was wondering if we should move in together.
If I’m fired, I think that probably means I don’t have to see patients. [He starts to walk away.]
I don’t need your labs. You have acid reflux.
Acid splashes on the vocal chords, they tense, make that squawking sound. It’s completely harmless. I’m gonna give you a prescription and you are gonna go away.
Why’d you move your belt?
You didn’t tell me that.
That’s not a potbelly. It’s a tumor. That’s why pancreatic cancer was on my mind. My brain was trying to tell me…
It can cause acid reflux. We should scope you.
No it’s not. [The elevator doors open and Taub comes out.]
I’m sure he will half-appreciate the irony. Take this man to radiology. Pancreatic scan. And stay with him. [He gets on the elevator.]
Do you have more than one lipstick in the same shade? Maybe one that has a sealing agent and one that doesn’t?
You really don’t think you’re just… overreacting to the other night?
[clearly confused] Wha… You… You’re… You’ve been overreacting to something I said?
I quit.
You can go suckle the little bastard child who makes you feel good about yourself.
[blinking and trying to clear his head] No, no. That — that’s not what happened. I told you that I needed you. You — You helped me.
[shakily as Cuddy touches his cheek] No. I’m not okay.
[shouting through the door] Help! [He bangs on the door a few times.] Help me!
Dry heaves are gone, so am I.
No, no, no, no. I’m here voluntarily. Just got to check with me.
[from the doorway] Wow. [They both look up.] And he’s black. I thought you’d be a little more sensitive on the slavery issue.
Can’t keep me.
I am a lot better. No painkillers. No hallucinations. Leg hurts, but it’s manageable. Great job. Gonna miss you. Want to start missing you as soon as possible.
I’ll take it under advisement.
I was deluded into thinking I might be crazy.
Well, that’s not gonna cheer me up, is it?
Yeah, I get it. Uh, just one thing I’m getting hung up on. I can leave whenever I want. How ‘bout I start with that? [He heads for the door.]
[turning slowly] I don’t want to practice medicine. I’ve decided I want to be an astronaut.
Is that a popular new treatment – blackmail?
So, brass tacks… What do I have to do, and how long do I have to be here?
I set a goal.
My goal is to get your boss to write the letter that I want him to write. Now let’s talk process. I can smile through gritted teeth and play nice, but there are serious risks of violence involved in that choice so I’m going with turning this ward upside down, making you and your boss’ job and life so unmanageable that he’ll write whatever he has to write to get rid of me.
[who has continued unpacking, silently] Really?
Oh, you’re actually waiting for an answer this time. You can call me House.
[to Annie who is standing and staring into the office area] Is this the line?
No, you can’t.
[rapping with his cane on the glass window of the office] I need to request a new room. [He starts walking down the perimeter of the office, looking for someone. Alvie follows.]
I’m not on any meds.
Excuse me. I know you’re busy ignoring me, but my minibar is empty.
Go be that man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. [He goes to the piano.]
Don’t worry about the name. I’m just passing through. Don’t want to break any hearts.
So he’s claustrophobic, right? [to Jay] You’re claustrophobic? [to Beasley] Can I get a pen to write this stuff down?
[pointing at Richter] Paranoid. Check.
A crayon? Anybody?
Cut your wrists, huh?
That flew by.
Really? Is there a club?
I’m that good.
Would you believe me if I said “yes”?
Then, yes.
[nods] I also know you’re trying to be sweet, caring and effective. You’re just not.
[nods slightly] Okay.
Shut up. Nobody likes you.
Am I crowding you?
Can’t see the sun?
Oh, no! Everything is closing in.
[to Beasley] He’s the claustrophobic one, right? ‘Cause I’m doing this from memory. [He starts walking toward the basket.]
Why? The CIA satellites aren’t watching me. They’re watching you, ‘cause you’re wearing green. [As Richter tears off his sweater and throws it on the ground, House turns to Beasley] That one was just too easy. [Turning to Hal] Seriously, anorexia? What, are you supposed to be a girl? And, in answer to your implicit question, yes, those pants do make you look fat. [Hal backs away quickly. House looks around and sees Susan standing under the basket.] How upset were you when you woke up in the ER and you were still alive and a failure? [She turns and walks away. House looks at Beasley, bounces the ball a couple of times and makes an easy lay-up.]
You’re right. It is rewarding when you reach out.
Put it on my tab.
I think you’ll find music therapy’s more effective if the patients are inside to hear it. [She smiles and continues playing.] Where’d you get the key?
[pointing to Annie] So, if she ever talks, are we gonna get a German accent?
So let him come play the piano.
Nice. You’re a little heavy on the right foot, though. [He sits next to Annie.]
You’re not talking. [She stops playing and looks at him.] Her head is bobbing to her pulse.
Technically, yes.
Can I lead this time?
[to Lydia, over his shoulder as they lead him off] Leave the lid unlocked when you’re done.
Can you close the door? You’re letting all the cool air out.
I’ve had some time to think about the approach I’ve been taking. [He looks back at Beasley.] I’m new, unhappy here, and I’ve been taking it out on you guys… unfairly. It was… misdirected anger. [He bounces the ping pong ball on the table once.] ‘Cause when you think about it, the real jerks here are the doctors.
See how they give you a ping pong table, but no paddles. No net. It’s like they’re mocking you.
The game is called table tennis, not table volleyball.
Who ever saw a tennis court without a net?
No one’s gonna try to hang themselves with a ping pong net.
No, little kids are allowed to play ping pong and they can play the piano.
Seriously? Is that your strategy? Give everybody what they want except me?
Shut up.
No
Yep.
I don’t know yet.
You know, it’s easier to come up with a new plan in silence.
God, if only you’d said that two minutes ago, before I came up with my new scheme. Now I’m committed. [He takes a step past her then leans back with a huge smile on his face.] Ha! Get it!
[approaches] Do you have third floor privileges?
Is that true?
I need you to break into Nolan’s office.
I want you to focus.
Go into Nolan’s office. Look at his calendar. I need the name of the woman he met with at 11 today.
Yes, get me chips and dip. What else?
You get the name?
Well, then we can assume the girl he’s with is called “Nooner.”
He’s gonna fork her.
That’s okay. I got her license plate. I call my friend. He gets the name. I get the letter that gets me out of here.
I’m on level minus four. I’m still writing with a crayon. You?
Hal’s at level five?
Will he sell you some minutes?
[thinks] Can you cheek a pill?
That’s too bad for you.
You sure you’re good with this?
So how do we start?
Think Hal will mind if they’re wet?
No. It’s your other friend at the asylum.
Hallucinations are gone, so is the Vicodin.
They got me on some non-narcotic. I’m dealing. I need you to run a license plate.
Track down the owner of this car, and I’ll be able to visit you in your office tomorrow. My doctor is too smart, too old and too well-dressed to only be running one ward. He screwed up something in his life and I think he’s doing it again. I need her name so I can blackmail the blackmailer.
What did he want to know?
Well, now I’m calling you to tell you that if he calls you –
You can.
It turns out… you’re my only friend.
And I hate you. I’m gonna cooperate.
One, two, three. [They all put a card on their foreheads, facing out. House has the 8 of diamonds, Jay-Bird the 10 of clubs.] Okay, Stomp. Start the bidding. Highest card wins. [Stomp, who has the king of hearts, gets up and leaves.] That’s probably a fold. Richter.
He’s not confident, Alvie. Crush him, in the form of a rhyme if you want.
Oh. That’s a lot of nerve for someone with a two on their head.
[reaching for her] Come here.
I want to see if you’ve got what it takes. Give me your best poker face. [She leans down and stares at him. He stares back. He sees his card reflected in her glasses.] Too rich for my blood. [to Diane] You can take my seat.
Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow. [He takes the pills and water. As he passes Alvie, he sticks out his tongue. There are two pills on it. Alvie smiles and touches his nose.]
I’ve been humming to her. She sways. It might be significant. [Lydia continues playing.] Are you ignoring me or are you just letting my charm wash over you.
You’re right. Your playing does get worse when you talk. [She gives him a “very funny” look.] I assume she loved music.
Well, if she responded to the piano, she might respond even better to the cello.
Different desk. Different doctor.
Nope. Can I go now? There’s a manic out there with a fresh carton of cigarettes, and he’s a terrible bluffer.
He hit me. I hit him back. Repeat until pulpy.
Well, that tends to be the way fights work – different interpretations of the same circumstances.
There’s that tone again.
How come every time you compliment me, it sounds like an accusation?
It’s not that unusual.
Why don’t you stop pretending that you haven’t reached a conclusion? You don’t trust me. Actually, it’s more fundamental than that. You don’t like me.
You think I’m not taking my meds.
Yes. So what do you want me to do? Want me to take a urine test? Will that earn your trust?
A little dignity, please.
Yeah, but you don’t have to have courtside seats. Can I at least use a stall?
For he himself has said it, and it’s greatly to his credit, that he is an Englishman. He i-i-i-i-is an Englishman.
Get it while it’s hot.
Why are you doing that?
[putting down his cards and turning] I’m just curious. As a doctor, What are you doing?
[taking his cane and standing] So… legit medical reasons. You’re not just trying to break the guy because he’s a little different.
I’m not doing anything.
I’m thinking of hitting you again.
What’s the difference between pretending to cooperate and cooperating?
I sat and watched while he did something stupid and pointless. I cooperated.
Where’s Freedom Master?
Get out there. They said everybody has to get out there. Talk! Say something!
Did you drug him?
He has a flat affect. He’s practically catatonic.
Don’t tell me that he’s fine! You did this. He was functioning. He was happy.
Yeah. He’s way better off now.
I’m not allowed to get angry? They screwed him up. And for the record, I am two privilege levels above Susan. And I got the same depression-scale score.
Happiness is happiness. The test is the test. Coping is coping.
Absolutely! I need to address some deeper issues, which I can do on an outpatient basis. Three hours a week? And that’s just my opening offer. If you want to counter, I’ll likely fold.
“No” is not an argument. Are you trying to frustrate me?
“No” again? I can cope! I’m coping. In fact… [He reaches into his pants pocket.] I’m coping better than you think. I’ve not been taking my meds. [He holds out a handful of pills.] Not one. And yet, I still scored a “high functioning” on your depression test.
Manipulated. My proof is that I can fool the test, I can fool you, which means I am high functioning. I am sane, rational, capable. I should not be here.
I’m not gonna take it. I’ll just cheek it again.
You want me to lick your hand?
It’s sugar.
There is no new plan. I’m out of plans.
We stop talking. [He lifts his leg and lies down, facing he wall.]
I see you’ve got some cello in your trunk. [She turns to face him.] And, no, that’s not a euphemism. [He stands.]
I’m living in a psychiatric hospital. Staring out of the window is what we do. I assume you’ll need help carrying it up. I still got grounds privileges.
Yes, cast aside the useless cripple. How very German of you.
Or we could ask Clark Kent to pitch in.
Eh, the dolly… already feels good about itself. He was a happy-go-lucky superhero until they told him he has no powers. We let him help out, he feels good about himself. Might be less depressed.
So why do you put your life on hold to visit your sister-in-law five times a week?
No. You’re not even a bad person for lying about why you’re doing it. [loudly, to Freedom Master] Oh, that is impressive. That is a superhuman feat. [Freedom Master grunts as he puts the cello down next to the car.] Why don’t you take a rest before you fly that thing up to the ward? [He leans against the car, breathing hard.] He’s still depressed. Give me your car keys. [He holds out his hand.]
I’m gonna make him feel like he’s flying. I’ll just drive him around the grounds, top down, wind in his hair. [She laughs.] Seriously… you’re gonna say no to that? [pointing at Freedom Master]
Why are you so nice to me?
Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied? I’m not just driving around the grounds in your convertible. I’m kidnapping him and stealing your car.
You sure? [She nods and opens the car door.] I was just starting to feel a little heat between us. Thought we had kind of a “Bonnie and Clyde” thing going there.
Hmm. See you.
You can do this. [Cut to House wearing an orange and yellow jump suit with an “XFly” logo and goggles. There’s a Ferris wheel in the background.] If you hold my hand, I can do it too.
Don’t let go!
Keep it down, Freedom Master.
You’re scaring the good citizens.
It was fun. [Freedom Master runs in a circle House.] You can repay me by telling Nolan he’s an idiot.
We do enjoy it. [Freedom Master “wooshes” off.] Careful of the traffic. [He puts the giraffe in the car. Don’t go damaging any fenders. [He looks up.] Hey! [Freedom Master is climbing on the wall at the side of the garage.] Hey! Come on, get down. There’s no cry for help. There’s no cat in a tree.
[yells] NO! [as Freedom Master “flies” off the side of the garage.]
[has been staring at him, looking terrified about what he did] Don’t. [Nolan stops and looks back.] I need help.
So how’s this supposed to work?
About what?
You want me to whine about my mother?
I can tell you about the time I was five and my goldfish died.
I’ve had a billion things happen to me in my life. How am I supposed to know which ones are relevant?
Well, we better get moving, ‘cause this session could take 50 years.
I want to get better… Whatever the hell that means. I’m sick of being miserable.
Again with the reflecting – Yes, I’d like to be happy.
Well, bully for me.
SSRIs? That’s your genius technique?
For my leg. For pain.
I don’t want to change who I am.
If Van Gogh was your patient, he’d be satisfied painting houses instead of The Starry Night.
You don’t know that.
Hmmm… Delicious.
I’m waiting for my communion wafer. [He takes the pills and the water, handing the empties back to Safer. Alvie follows him as he walks away from the office.]
Nope.
[pushing Alvie’s hands away] I swallowed it. [He starts to walk away. Alvie follows.]
You don’t take meds, Alvie. I decided to get sane.
I’m not scamming, Alvie.
[turning to look at him] They didn’t break me. I am broken. Now stop worshipping me and go worry about your own loser life.
Prom?
[taking off his glasses] Role-playing? I’m not sure how pretending to be a businessman with a foot fetish is gonna help, but I’m game.
Diane… is convinced that Silent Girl hates her. Richter’s not as paranoid as you think. He just likes that you think that. And my roommate hates me.
I’m sure that they’ve done some form of rudimentary analysis on me, concluded that I’m a jerk.
I have had relationships.
Just open up?
Strangers?
Hi.
It’s like “hello” only shorter.
Judging by the fancy suit, I’d say you were a donor. The nervous demeanor says maybe you’ve had issues, probably why this place has personal meaning. [He puts a fistful of nuts in his mouth and starts talking again before he swallows them.] But this is supposed to be about me. [He swallows.] I take advantage of my friends. Friend, really, I’ve only got one.
I’m not gay.
Actually, I am. See that guy over there? [He indicates Nolan, who has his head tilted back, eating the Maraschino cherry from his drink.] He’s my lover. He’s also my psychiatrist, which some would argue is a little inappropriate, but they just don’t know what love is. Am I right?
No, but I have to tell intimate secrets to people.
Hadn’t thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should probably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let’s get me better.
Hi.
[geekily plays with a straw] I’m a philanderer.
Philanderer doesn’t mean that I give a lot to charity. It means –
Uh, you were asking me if there were any nuts in the hors d’oeuvres.
[looking up] Honey! [He stands.]
I did connect with one guy. But my propensity for screwing things up overtook me. Then my desire to have fun overcame my propensity.
[thinks about that] Apparently not.
Why don’t we just talk?
How come you weren’t pissed at me for stealing your car?
Hmmm. I’m not sure about the German-English translation of “nice.” Stealing was nice or… ruining Freedom Master’s life?
Good night.
You’re talking to me now.
[sounding a little surprised] Yeah.
She kissed me. Don’t read into the phrasing. We kissed each other.
How do I feel about that? It was a kiss. Kisses are good things.
That was a loaded “okay.”
‘Cause you’re being judgmental. If I’d said that I’d had some delicious Chilean sea bass for dinner last night, would you say, “and how do you feel about that?”
[laughing slightly] See, you’re being judgmental. Isn’t that against your code or something?
[sitting up then slouching back in the chair] Who’s that woman you were with in the parking lot?
Obviously you have no problem with the infidelity.
Then who is she?
I might not have to work so hard if there were some personal items in here. You got one number on speed dial. It says “Dad.” Come on, how old are you?
I want to talk about you. I want to know who I’m taking advice from.
I think there are no personal items in here because you have no personal life.
you are a lonely man. You’ve screwed up every opportunity you’ve had in life.
[sighs] I don’t know.
Why did you kiss me?
I found out you can only be happy so long before the catatonic guy with two broken limbs rolls off the elevator. Philosophically speaking.
My mother caught me masturbating… to pictures of her mother.
Successes only last until someone screws them up. Failures are forever.
Okay, I accept the fact that there’s nothing I can do. Now, what can I do?
Wow. Powerful things, these apologies. Get someone to jump off a building and you say two words and you move on with your life. Hardly seems fair.
Hey.
Yeah.
You really think he’s gonna answer?
Why?
Things change. It doesn’t mean they get better. You gotta make things better, you can’t just keep talking and hope for the best. [House starts looking in the distance, puzzled.]
[getting up] I can save him. “They stole her voice box.” That’s what he said. That’s what she was staring at. That’s why she’s staring. [He goes to the window of the office.]
[pointing, rattling the glass] ‘Cause there’s a music box in there.
[rattling the doorknob] Come on, just give it to me. I can – [The orderly tries to grab his arm.] I am not having a psychotic break. [to Beasley] I promise you this will work.
It’s the blue box there on the top shelf. [He puts his cane on a ledge and takes the box from the orderly. He heads for Freedom Master.] This is what you wanted. This is what you needed – a voice. [He kneels next to Freedom Master and tries to hand him the music box.] You thought you could cure Silent Girl with this so by your own rationale, it should cure you. [Freedom Master doesn’t move.] There’s nothing wrong with you. You’re healing. All the parts work. Speak! [Nothing. House grabs his face and shakes it slightly.] Come on, speak! Say something!
I need to know what this is.
There’s two possible outcomes. It ends, someone gets hurt. Or it doesn’t end, someone gets hurt.
I can’t – I can’t do this. [He hands her back the sheet music.]
[sighs] Good-bye, Lydia. [He gets up and leaves.]
[slouched and glowering in his chair] Oh, just do the treatment or shut up.
Yes, a process. Wouldn’t want to disrupt the process with results.
Yeah. You’re a genius. Rhymes with “penius.”
[opening the paper] Is this a day pass?
A consult? What happened – you went through every sane doctor in town?
[looking at an x-ray] Lacunar infarct. Converted to hemorrhagic stroke. It squashed his brain. They didn’t miss anything.
That’s what you knew. His brain has been replaced by blood. It’s over. [Nolan kisses his father’s hand.] And that’s obvious to any doctor who looked at that scan, even a shrink. You want someone to tell you that what you need to do is okay, to give you permission, absolution.
You have no friends, no family. At some point, you made a mistake. You lost everything. And now I’m the closest thing you got to a friend.
I’m sorry I pushed you away. It’s what I do when I’m afraid. [She makes a scoffing sound.] Again, German-English translation may be a little off.
Oh, well, then I take the apology back. [She laughs.] We’re all pathetic. It’s what makes everything interesting.
[still leaning against the wall by the door, bails him out] Then we wouldn’t have no regrets.
And my roommate is a jerk.
If I can't get no sleep?
[getting into the rhythm] If you don't make connections
[shrugs] Just do a talent show. [Everyone, including Lydia, laughs.]
[enjoying himself] But at least we have each other
How are you doing? You hanging in there?
Things are actually… Actually good. [He sounds a little surprised.]
I'm not that cured. No, I still got stuff to do, but… I'm good.
I'm sorry. [He looks around and pulls up a chair.] I was trying to prove a point. I was trying to be right. I ended up putting you in a dangerous situation, and I was not equipped to handle it. You got hurt, and it's my fault. And I'm sorry.
[standing and steering Freedom Master’s chair] I'm gonna try those pink ones today. You?
Got a surprise.
If you go silent for over a decade, you don't just get to slide right back into society.
I want an overnight pass.
I've earned it.
Isn't extending trust part of the whole "getting me better" thing?
Please give me the pass.
Hi.
I'm –
You didn't say anything. And now Annie's leaving, and I hear you're going to Arizona.
I don't want you to go.
I just don't want it to change.
She left.
I'm lost.
You can't just console me by giving me a lollipop when I skin my knee.
Back off. People already think we're gay.
I quit.
I think you're confusing me with Jake Gyllenhaal.
Yeah, and I want to stay that way. Talked it over with my therapist. I need to change my environment, my habits.
Which will help immensely with my new job in research. I’ve sent out some resumes. Research means no patients, less pressure.
I'm sorry. I know this will affect both of you... And Thirteen... And the one with the nose. I just can't risk coming back here.
I know it's the right call. Just don't know what to do with my time. And my leg – (rubbing his thigh) Pain's flared up since I left Mayfield. Ibuprofen’s barely putting a dent in it.
Right. Doctors the world over treat chronic pain with collections of Hummel figurines.
You already made me get a roommate. Wilson's got one bedroom. I don't think we can get any more connected without unzipping.
Difference is that Beethoven’s 5th isn't gonna be poop tomorrow.
Try not to be a jerk. I'm trying. I’m just failing.
(looking past Wilson) They're smoking. (Wilson looks at him questioningly) Your balls.
Blue is the color you got to watch out for.
I think there's a medicated powder for that. Although, vinegar could work. (looking for vinegar among a collection of bottles on the shelf) My o-chem prof talked about how, theoretically, you shouldn't trust the results of a hemoglobin a1c test on a chronically acidotic patient. The acid in the blood slows the reaction between the hemoglobin protein and blood sugar. Browning meat is the same chemical process, which means, it should also be slowed by acid. (House has poured some vinegar into a cup and is brushing it onto the meatballs in the frying pan)
(smiling) That's the spirit.
(gesturing for Cuddy to follow and heading toward the kitchen) I’m making gnocchi.
Cecile’s in my cooking class. She doesn't speak English.
(in Chinese) MISSIONARY
(rolling some pastry on a board) You bake the potatoes instead of boiling them, it's less moisture, fewer gluten bonds, lighter gnocchi.
Feeling better.
(in Chinese) I MEANT THE POSITION.
I do love a good groveling, but my decision is final.
Yeah. But it's not. We flirted. We kissed. I fondled. I hallucinated a night with you and yelled it from a hospital balcony. You're not a narcissist.
Not the reason I’m leaving.
(to Cecile) You just couldn't keep your trap shut.
Great. You're up. I need a taster. Ragout with pork sausage, beef thigh, no cream. (He holds a wooden spoonful of ragout in front of Wilson)
Bed is for sissies, unless you're having sex, in which case... No, bed is still for sissies.
(stirring again) Should've been here when I was butchering the ox. What do you expect? I’m an addict. I turn everything up to eleven.
No. I was trying to find something I could set at eleven without blowing out my eardrums. (pulling a wooden spoon out of another pot) Star anise with caramelized onions. The sulfur compounds bring out the meat flavor. (He gives the spoon to Wilson) I couldn't sleep because of my leg. It was either make ragout or go out on the street looking to score.
You're early. (He turns and heads for the kitchen. He is wearing a bib apron)
I knew you'd show up here complaining about Foreman. Thought you'd hold out for another week at least.
I went crazy, not stupid. I leave, Foreman embraces his inner mugabe.
Embryonali – unhatched chicken egg. (He drops the egg into his hand and passes it from one hand to the other until it is cool enough to hold) I'm gonna suck out some of the yolk and replace it with ragout. By the way, you can tell the other lepers that their absence has been noted.
Daddy's little co-dependent is all grown up. Making room for daddy's hot bisexual with boyfriend problems.
Stop being a coward for one thing.
At a job that no one before me has ever done. His fears are justified. You're just afraid of giving him control over you, which might work at home. It makes it almost impossible for him to do his job. Pass me those crackers.
I'm saying... That you would be happier if you learned when it's okay to give in. (He looks up to find Thirteen staring at him in wonderment) What?
Taste this.
I know. And yet, my leg hurts. (He rubs his thigh and leans against the kitchen island)
Coffee ice cream.
Started thinking about what you said, about me obsessing. Started obsessing about obsessing. Decided to take a day off.
How like a man to think that I enjoy slaving over a hot stove all day while you're off banging secretaries.
That was before I discovered the biggest loser marathon on cable. I like to pretend they can see me eating.
It's fine.
My leg's killing me. Cooking helped for a while. I guess I got bored. My leg started hurting again, then I got worried, and that made the pain worse.
That nothing's gonna help. That I end up in the very dark place. I'm fine... Just not happy.
What if nothing works? What if nothing gives me more than a few days before my brain starts looking for the next fix, before my leg feels like someone's shoving nails into it? What do I do then?
If you wanted a quickie, you should've called ahead. I'm a mess.
You have lunch with Cuddy on Tuesdays.
And you are checking up on me.
You were running out of socks for me to borrow. we got plenty of underwear, though. I'm fine.
And consistency proves what? Really. I’m good. I’ll put these in your room.
♪You always hurt♪ ♪ The one you love♪
No. The only thing you know is that I’m a genius who got a dog to pee in your toilet. You don't know how I did it or, more interestingly, where I peed.
Et tu, Butte? You got no reason to be here. He's the one I was jerking around.
Ow. It hurts. Please go away now. If you really think I’m using, how about asking me before taking a wrench to your plumbing?
Fine. Let’s get you some proof. Hide your eyes, ladies.
(looking at Cuddy) You too.
If the lab says that this is retriever too, please let me know right away. It'd explain my overwhelming desire to wipe my butt on your carpet.
I slipped.
I solved my old team's case. I was about to take the pills. I went online. I found people posting medical problems, and... My leg stopped hurting.
Oh? I'm supposed to be changing my life. This is not a change.
Says the guy making sand castles in my brain.
So you're okay with me going online, solving cases?
The hospital is part of my old life. If I go back, I might become... who I was before, pills and all.
Guess we're gonna find out.
Oh, my God, it's three years ago. Does that mean I’m still crazy?
I know. I just ran into Thirteen while she was clearing out her locker. My condolences. Although it's not like she's the hottest woman in the world.
Sort of.
Not for a month or so. So you'll be in charge. I'm just gonna pitch in a little.
I don't want to step on any toes, but I guess I do have a higher duty to the patient.
You're rushing to a diagnosis because you're rushing out of this room because you're rightly upset with me. Although I wasn't the one who made that asinine decision to –
Poison fits better because of the vomiting. Bug bite might not be a bite. It might be the start of chloracne.
I was hoping you'd get there on your own. [Foreman glares at him.] So I guess we should talk to Cuddy.
I need this in my life.
Yeah, that's why I did it. [He looks at Foreman.] Sorry. If you want, I’ll explain it to Thirteen.
Think I can probably deal with that last one.
Didn't pee once in the sandbox.
What did you think I was talking about? Hmmm. You didn't use garlic. You didn't use it last night either. We always use garlic on Chicken Florentine.
You seem to be losing your sense of smell.
I can check right now if you pull my finger. [He picks up the TV remote.]
You weren't wearing shoes last night either.
I told you to get that echo fixed.
What's his name?
The white coats taught me a whole bunch of fun coping and relating skills.
Coping skill number one… Complete avoidance. [His cell phone rings.] You happy? [answering phone] Booty call? Give me 20 minutes to not shower.
Lassa fever. You were mad that I withheld it last time, so I’m saying it right up front. He's already stabilized, so 40 CCs of ribavirin, and we're home in time for Ellen.
Oh.
Don't people sometimes travel? To places that have, you know, a fever that originated in the Nigerian town of Lassa?
Oh. [pause] Again.
The Egypt visit was for the African Union Meeting, Where I’m guessing he was [miming quotation marks] meeting people from [more quotation marks] Africa. Which includes Liberia, which sent some members of their Foreign Ministry, which has itself just been hit by an outbreak of jock itch. No, wait. Not jock itch. Lassa fever.
I did say it up front. It's great to have the old team back together again, huh?
And I’m Greg.
You're not actually saying that I have too loud a cane?
Only in the sense that it has a rubber tip on the end, not a tap shoe.
Okay, we started badly. I apologize for the noise, and we will try to figure out a way to be quieter –
[whispers] Wow.
I'm just gonna sit here quietly.
I feel like I’ve been inadvertently undermining your authority, so I’m just gonna observe. Not gonna say a word. [He “zips” his lips.]
[to Cameron] Uh, I need you to spread your legs so I can do an “H.”
Makes sense. I guess you don't need me. [He gets up to leave.] Oh, by the way, you might want to close the blinds. It’s really bright in here.
Come on. Give me the benefit of the doubt. You said he's a jerk. I barely talked.
You could be sipping Courvoisier next to a replica of the Playboy grotto if you tell him what you got on him.
The closest he's been to Vietnam? Ordering the mee krob at that place on the corner.
Exactly.
I saw his mail.
No. He was holding it. Private medical insurance. Not from the VA. Plus, he's got to be early 50s. He's too young to be a vet. So I looked further.
Online. There's no reference to him in any of the vet records.
Just look how you're acting. People have been tiptoeing around this jerk for years.
Victims get pity, heroes get adulation. It's way better.
I could prove this.
I didn’t do anything, the guy’s a totally ass.
[tentatively] Hello?
Thought I had detected the sickly sweet smell of maple syrup and socialized medicine. It smells like… victory. That big flag in your place prompted me to chat with your housekeeper. Turns out you're a citizen of the Great White North.
Technically, no. Well, technically, yeah, but two steps. Hardly –
Speaking of, you know what can get you six months and a $100,000 fine? Falsely claiming that you won a medal in Vietnam.
Canada did not send troops to fight in Vietnam, you idiot.
Oh. On a related note, go Maple Leafs.
It's scleroderma.
Patient's dying. I'm done with clever. Look at his skin. [He holds up a small photo from the file.] It's tight for a 75-year-old.
Nodules? And you're calling tight skin subjective?
Fungal lesions can be missed.
We treat wrong, we could send this disease into overdrive. You're with me on the scleroderma.
We get it. You don't like the guy, you didn't want to work on this case. And yet you're still here. Why don't you take a stand? Either do something about it or shut up.
I'll get Cuddy. I can convince her to –
I didn't break in.
I can fix this.
You're kicking me out?
Hi, honey. [He injects Murphy in the neck.] How was your day? [He catches Murphy as he passes out.]
Morning. First of all, my bad. I've gone through this whole thing recently. I don't want to bore you. Short version: I’m really trying to do work on some stuff. This is a definite setback. Although, in fairness, you really did make it tough.
Phantom pain in your missing arm? Five different kinds of painkiller in your medicine cabinet. That's what this magic box of neurological trickery is for.
This would be a lot easier if you do what the crazy guy who tied you up says. [He lets House put his stump through the hole. House removes the duct tape on Murphy’s left arm.] Put your hand in there. Put your hand in there. [House closes the lid on the right side of the box.] Now look. Mirror magic. Your arm is back. [With the lid covering the right arm, Murphy sees his left and it’s reflection. It looks like two whole arms, side by side.] Now clench both your fists at the same time. Clench. Real hard. [Murphy does. He is also on the verge of tears.] If you believe in God, pray that this is gonna work. You might also want to ask him why he blew off your arm. Ready? Now let go.
You want to curl up and cry, the lounge chair's a little more comfy.
You know what that means.
So either you killed him by not having confidence in your opinion, or you killed him by being too attached to your opinion. If you're anything like me – and, by the way, you are – you need to know which.
There's a reason I hired you. You used to know what to do with a locked door.
That's nice.
[joining Wilson on the couch] Huh.
I was nice. [pause] You really want to know?
You could have said no, in good conscience.
Which means I get... [Looks excited.] Oh, cool.
[Looking at the file.] Maybe never. This game is fun.
Oh... Unfortunately I'm overdue a mani-pedi appointment.
Oh, right. Well, he's got all the time in the world.
17 doctors. Everything's been ruled out. Which means we have to re-rule out. Get a new history and physical. [Looks at Foreman.] Unless that's crazy, boss.
[Suddenly appears in the doorway.] Got what covered?
We didn't. Except of course the thing that killed him. [House stares at Chase.]
Nope. [Smiles at Foreman, who looks back at the X-ray.]
[To the person behind him.] You should try searching for "Misty May digs for gold." [Thirteen's turns around surprised.] Make sure you put it in quotes.
So that's it? [Turns his chair around so he can see her.] You're done with your little experiment with Foreman?
Good. 'Cause if you came back, Foreman would try and save the relationship and he'd give up being the boss.
God no. Trying to save MY relationship with Foreman. Right now I'm Kobe, playing the game I love, however the hell I want. Phil Jackson has to listen to everyone else bitch about it. [Gets up and starts to leave.] Enjoy Cabo.
Really? Interesting.
Good-bye Thirteen. [Leaves.]
Don't usually see brain damage after a rectal biopsy.
Not after spending the last week getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.
Oh, God, it's... The Virgin Mary. [Cameron rolls her eyes.]
[Stares at the X-ray.] Unless... The Dural layer was already separated from the brain when the fluid started to build up. Get a Dural biopsy to confirm brain cancer. [To Foreman.] Nice catch.
Okay. [Goes to shut the door but Thirteen stops him.]
I was talking to you. I was spying on the milf in the running shorts.
I don't want you back on the team.
Which is why I don't want you back on the team. Now that you're out of the picture, he's better than ever, which is going to make me less miserable than ever, which is why neither of us gives a damn how, when, or on what island in the Bahamas you went to get from it all.
Costa Rica?
I assumed you were lying, because it would have been idiotic of you to tell me truth. Yet another reason I have no use for you. [House shuts the door.]
Since when has cancer been considered nothing?
On the other hand, adenocarcinoma of the stomach would cause pain, constipation, nutritional deficiencies that could cause seizures.
You were right about the cancer, just wrong about the place. [Looks at Chase whose mind appears to be elsewhere.] Continue to say nothing if you agree. [Chase looks up at House surprised.]
I'd get canceling her ticket, if you then showed up with two more to somewhere better.
Or showed up at all. But how does just ruining her plans get her to agree to yours?
Well, nowhere this week, thanks to you.
I think... I actually believe you. If you're telling the truth, you're even more rational than I... Well, not more. Then again more sane. You're going to be a good boss, boss.
And every time we look to see where it's coming from, he starts seizing.
I think something is.
It's definitely not cancer.
[Turns around to face them.] Drug-resistant strain of what? Bacterial cultures, viral serologies, ANA and a NCA were all negative.
I'd be a lot more certain if it was my idea, but it's the best we got.
Just waiting for whatever is about to go wrong.
She have a theory that makes more sense than abdominal epilepsy?
Really? You're accusing Foreman, not me? Cool.
Makes sense. He loves power, and I love puzzles.
True. But when I had them both... It wasn't Foreman.
He said he's moved on.
I believe that he believes it. [House's pager goes off, he looks at it.] Looks like it's time for me to get off the bench. [Walks into Jack's room.] What's up?
I understand you're a big fan. I'll have my guy send over a signed glossy.
You paged me to tell me what it's not?
That... I did not expect.
Darn it. I knew I should have stayed outside. Fantasy's always much better than the reality.
I know. That's why it's so interesting.
Fever, stomach pain, seizures, peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and now spots.
That suddenly developed eight hours after he started the meds?
CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff neck along with a headache.
Go on.
Not my decision. But if it was, I'd say start him on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy. If he's going to have any real inflammation, it'll be down there.
Is it on his penis? [Cameron stops and looks at him.] Kid's rash?
Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels. That's why we didn't see any inflammation on the biopsies. It's not polyarteritis. It's Degos disease. [The all just stand there.] I'll do it.
Your son has Degos disease. Causes micro blood vessels in the brain, skin, GI tract to break down, clot off. It sometimes manifests early on with atrophic papules on the penis. In your son's case, we don't know why, but they came much later.
There isn't one. It's incurable.
We've rechecked the biopsies. It's definitely Degos. I'm sorry. I wish there was something we could do.
Not much longer.
A day at the most. [Roy starts crying. House nods and leaves the room.]
That's the point. The billionaire thinks that the gods will treat him better if he's broke. I suggested he give it to me...
Who said the world is supposed to work?
He's irrational. So are most people. Unfortunately it doesn't make him insane.
People don't get what they deserve, they just get what they get. There's nothing any of us can do about it.
Why?
I know you didn't do it, so I guess the first.
Why would I care what Foreman wants?
Yes I am.
I just made a $10,000 short sale on a stock I know is going to crash because of what I saw a grief-stricken dad do on his son's deathbed.
Yes I did.
She's making a mistake.
She's a good doctor.
I'm not the one in charge anymore.
She's a smoking hot, newly single bisexual.
Because I was born with a heart three sizes too small.
Yes I... [Suddenly has an epiphany.]
He still alive?
Good. Start him on heparin and IV immunoglobulin.
The cardiac arrest wasn't just a "everything goes to hell in a hand basket" arrest. It was a coronary event. Coronaries are large vessels. Means it can't be Degos.
Obstructed blood vessels. But they can't be obstructed because of Degos. Means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
Nope. But I will be if he responds to the heparin and the immunoglobulin. [Foreman nods and walks over to the nurses' station.] By the way, someone screwed over your girlfriend and she ran to me, Cuddy, and Wilson. Everyone but you. She's not over you.
The medicine worked.
Fat old black guy. Knew he had to be taking something for his cholesterol.
I'm not the boss.
Why? I doubt we'll ever be treating a genocidal dictator again. Better a murder than a misdiagnosis.
I'm picking lint out of my belly button.
Six weeks. Longer than I thought it would take... For you to notice that I’m sleeping in your living room, and offer other options. [He sits up slightly but his hands are still under the covers.]
True, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation.
You didn't want me to sleep where you and Amber slept.
After she died, you converted the study to a bedroom and the bedroom to a study... Except it's not a study, it's a shrine. [pause] Can I tell you something? [Wilson gives him an inquiring look.] I wasn't picking lint out of my belly button.
[closing the file and heading for the coffee maker] There's no fuse. He's not a bomb. Right now he's not a patient either.
I'm not ignoring it. I'm labeling it a coincidence.
We reconciled. [waving it off] It was a whole thing. Big country. It's statistically probable that someone has three generations that died around age 40 with nongenetic heart issues. Dice have no memory.
If we ran a battery of tests on every nonsymptomatic statistical anomaly —
You want to take this case 'cause he's yet another lonely, sad puppy. You should have been a vet.
That sold you?
And you?
He's only agreeing with you 'cause he wants to have sex with you. And by the way, I agree with you too, especially in those pants. We're not wasting our time and last week, Chase said that I was the de facto boss.
First we take Berlin. And then we circle around behind Poland and yell, "surprise!"
I like things the way they are. I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you. Until now.
I don't have a medical license. All I can do is pretend.
No, I don't. [She turns back.] I'm not saying you don't win. I'm just saying do you really need to punish me by making me carry a clipboard for your lackey of the week?
Exactly. The requirement sets out what you have to do – certify – which you can do with one hand tied behind your back. Now, if you want to tie my hands...
He'll be back in the morning.
Second floor. A nurse will help you find him.
So did you come to see me for personal advice?
Unless you were his girlfriend and his sister, you got nothing to worry about.
[picks up the phone and hands it to her] Dial extension 742. Tell Dr. Foreman you got some cool information. Good night.
Yeah, fine.
On your fingers.
Oh! I see. Wow, sorry about that.
Well, we're all here to learn.
She tell you how to stop me?
Well, that obviously didn't come from her. But fair enough.
Now I’ve done it. There's urine everywhere! Gosh. The great thing about the teacher-student relationship is the teacher can often learn more from the student. [He picks up the sheet for recording his hours and shows it to Singh.] Have you learned anything yet?
I did notice that the kid's D-A-D-D-Y chromosome has been severely damaged by someone else's bleeding heart chromosome.
I'm sure there are plenty of lies would've worked just as well, except without the years of therapy.
Recess. So where does that leave us? Chase?
I was saying, "do you think these shoes work in this color?" Send him home.
You're not very good at your job. You don't deserve candy. [He grabs the mints from her.]
Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.
Great contributions back there.
You had nothing to add... because you were distracted. A little devil on your shoulder told you to kill a guy, and now the little angel won't shut up, telling you you're gonna burn in a lake of fire.
You shouldn't be. [The elevator arrives. Chase follows House down the hall.] Talk to someone. Docs fixed me up in seven weeks. You're... ten minutes, tops.
Glad we had this little moment. Come on.
I'm Dr. House.
You have Ortoli syndrome. [Chase’s eyes open wide as he stares at House in surprise.] Dr. Chase?
Tests don't lie.
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares about medical mumbo jumbo? Tell him the treatment.
[pouring a glass of water] Doctors always want to make everything sound so complicated. It's Nabasynth.
Nabasynth.
The real tragedy here is that the Tiburon swab technology didn't exist to detect Ortoli back in your dad's day.
If you'll sign these discharge papers, I'll get you a bottle of meds. Take one twice a day for a week, you'll live a long, healthy life.
Are you watching TV? [The pounding continues.]
Were you on the phone?
Just now, were you talking?
Why are you here?
I sent the guy home with mints.
I missed the fact that there was something to miss. What is wrong with me?
What's the official cause of death?
Good.
Can we cut to the money shot? It's his heart, so let's look at his heart. Nice Y-incision ¬— [He starts the saw again. Foreman puts his hand between the saw and Donny. House turns off the saw.]
Really? 'Cause I don't think there's anything I could screw up that we haven't already screwed up.
[balancing himself against the sink] I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.
Differential diagnosis for resurrection. Go.
Yes, the fact that he's not dead means we did absolutely nothing wrong.
Yeah.
Autoimmune it is. Start him on steroids.
What if I, uh... If I sometimes hear whispering?
I had some dental work done in the Philippines when I was a kid. Adjoining metal fillings could corrode and pick up AM radio signals.
So there's no reason for me to be hearing things.
I wasn't on my best behavior. I admit. [He picks up the form Singh signed.] Allow me. [He rips the form in half.]
That won't be necessary.
It's not necessary, because I’m not ready to be a doctor again. I'm sorry.
Just... dozed off in front of the TV.
Maybe! I can't sleep in there. The heater's screwed up.
I'm just tired.
Great. Can you be right here somewhere else?
Not today. I'm hallucinating.
It's nothing visual this time. I hear whispering.
I'm losing it.
I checked everything. What's really scary is that I hear whispering while not on Vicodin. I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield.
Okay? You don't think there might be a logical explanation? Something I missed?
You know.
Why are you talking to her? You run out of living people? You can talk to me. I'm right here.
[entering] Sorry I’m late.
Yesterday I wasn't. Today I am.
Feeling much better. Thank you for not asking.
You are a woman. You can do anything.
[Checking out her ass as he follows her into the hall.] Are you sure you're only one woman?
I can see your nipples. Your turn.
So it's not bone cancer. Where's Chase?
Two mysteries, cool. Theories? [pause] Did I come in too soon? Okay, I’m gonna take another lap. And I want three new ideas by the time I come back. One of them's got to be not stupid. [He starts to leave, then stops.] Where there's pain... there's nerves. Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type one.
And I like the word "hereditary" in the title.
Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it.
Sleep at home.
No.
Are you getting some help? Or is this the way things are gonna be from now on? What's pathetic is you haven't gotten help because you want to feel bad. You want to suffer, 'cause if you feel guilty, then you're not a psychopath. Patient needs some carbamazepine. Now, I don't care how much that room scares you, you're doing your job.
Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse assigned to his floor. Get it? "Doody" nurse? [Chase and Foreman ignore him. Cameron turns away with a “look.”] Fine. Do the doctor thing.
A disease that advanced would've hit the liver.
[nods] Go treat with penicillamine. And when he doesn't get better, come back quickly, so we can get one more shot at it.
Why?
You're uncomfortable with me.
Good, I thought it was because of the sexual tension.
There was tension. And... it made me feel funny, so...
That's too bad. I was kind of getting into the whole hot-for-teacher thing.
Yeah. False alarm. [pause] What about us?
By buttons, you mean... [He stops mid-sentence and thinks.] Huh. [He gets up to leave. As he passes Cuddy he pauses and leans in close to her.] You do make me feel funny.
You're not gonna die.
In addition to high arches and some crystal bowl in the shape of a tuna, you also inherited a self-destruct button. It forms in the brain stem. Technically, it's an aneurysm. Presses on the nerves that control everything from tooth pain to heart rate. As you get older, it gets bigger, until finally... The button – which I’ll call intracranial berry aneurysm, 'cause I had a friend in high school with that name – stops the signal from your brain to your heart. And bam!
It does sound that way, doesn't it? But this time, no sugar pills. I'm gonna cut into your brain to make you think that I’m fixing it. And if our fake tests confirm it, I'm gonna be cutting into your son's brain too, [laughs] 'cause I’m just that committed.
Unless he walks out of here and gets run over by a bus, in which case, I will reconsider your fate argument. [at the door] You want to give him a call? Visiting hours don't apply to my patients.
Yeah. That's what I thought. The "saving the kid from pain" stuff was crap. You just don't want anything in your life that won't let you do whatever the hell you want to do whenever the hell you want to do it. You've had it easy. Sorry to screw you up.
[quietly] Hi, dad. I think I’ve been... focusing on the wrong thing. There were some good times. [long pause then, loudly] Wilson. This is stupid.
Foreman expects me to read an Xray on this itty bitty screen. He should have emailed me a larger phone. (He takes off his glasses and flips his phone shut) Why are you packing?
We?
So has Ramadan.
You should come with me. State pillow fighting championships. Dollar beers, wet T-shirts. In the words of the philosopher Eddie Money I’ve got two tickets to paradise.
Fine. (dialing his phone) I’ll let Foreman know that the 16 year old patient with the severe edema can wait. Relax, I’ve got no idea what’s wrong with her. So odds are, not fatal. (Wilson sighs as House leaves the room)
(from another room) Still not going.
She’s got rhabdo (rabdomyolsis). Who wants to come to the pillow fighting championships? Rutgers has got a great team this year, so glad their anchor didn’t turn pro.
It’s rhabdo. Patient gave you the answer. She fell down and went boom. We have to leave in an hour so should we eeny meeny?
Hard landing caused crushed muscles, crushed muscles release toxins into the bloodstream, toxins cause swelling of the hands and legs. It’s just another way of saying it’s rhabdo. (looking at his watch) Fifty-nine minutes.
(Looking back and forth from Chase to Cameron) Could you be sitting any further away from Chase and still be in the same room?
Can’t really be any of those things, since it’s rhabdo. I know it’s rhabdo, Foreman knows it’s rhabdo, deep in his heart, even Chase knows it’s rhabdo. Isn’t it annoying when everybody in the room knows something you don’t?
I’ve got a legitimate medical reason.
(leering) I forgot. I guess it’s no big deal. I was only using it as an excuse to come check out Patty and Selma.
Word on the street is, you set a new personal best for low-cut.
It’s a compliment. They’re always smokin. Oh, I remember. I need you to authorize the medical discharge of a minor. (holding up a file) That’s why I’m holding this in my hand.
(unashamedly looking at her derriere) Haven’t finished testing yet, but it rha- (he notices the full outbox on her desk) Your outbox is three times normal size. It’s not a metaphor.
You take papers home with you. (He sits down on Cuddy’s desk) Unless, you’re not going to be home. Unless you were, for example, going to a medical conference.
Me too.
I love that you checked.
That I have a case, yeah. You’re authorizing the discharge right now. (He turns to leave) That was a metaphor. (House leaves her office)
Is he dying?
In the next ten minutes?
I’ve thought about it. You’re right. I should go to the conference.
Oh, God no. She’ll ruin everything.
(holding up his ball) Two days away, you think I should pack ball-y? (He throws the ball in the air and catches it with his open backpack)
The bomb was going to go off on its own, if you’d kept quiet. So now you have to either come up with a convincing lie, or tell her the truth. Your choice. (House holds out his hand for the file Chase is carrying)
Of course.
Hi. I'm your doctor. (He puts the open laptop down on the bed table. A music video of Metallica’s Fuel is playing on the screen) This is Lars Ulrich, the greatest metal drummer of all-time. You know the song?
Good. (He hands her his cane) Drumstick. (He pulls a funduscope out of Chase’s pocket and hands it to her also) Another drumstick. I want you to rock out to the music the way you did last night.
Go on. This is a classic medical test. Hippocrates used it. Let's go.
(air drumming in time to the music) Come on, you've gotta keep time! Cross over on the high hat. Let's head bang!
(still playing the air drums) The chart said her potassium's low. Rhabdo elevates the potassium. (to Jordan) And monkey drums. (to Foreman) Ergo... The levels must've been really low last night. Which causes...
temporary muscle paralysis. Given this rate of muscle fatigue, there's no way she could've climbed stairs and then a fence to the pool. Low potassium means no jump, means no trauma. Tests mean "yes rhabdo.” Ergo, something else caused both the rhabdo and the low potassium. This time start by getting an accurate history. (House gets up and picks up his computer) Be careful. Our patient's a big fat liar. (He leaves the room)
I like to know how much boredom I'm missing. (reading from the program) "Patient perceptions of complications in end-stage chemotherapy." You didn't tell me you were giving a paper.
Last time you presented a paper, you gave me an advance copy and asked for feedback.
(still reading) Oh, look! An '80s party. Just when you think you left a flock of seagulls behind in your rearview mirror, suddenly it's up ahead like an undead hitchhiker.
(He stands up and closes the car door) Did you pack my leg warmers?
My God, man! She's not some floozy in a bar. She's the floozy I work for. There's gotta be no radical steps here. Gotta be subtle. We happen to attend the same party, the chat happens to turn personal –.
Exactly. She'll be red and delicious before she knows it.
Did her blood pressure drop during the barium swallow?
Rules out chronic conditions.
Talk to our little gossip girl. You need to know exactly where she's been and what she's done in the last 24 hours. Oh, I think – (He pretends to be losing the connection and ends the call)
(taking the bag) It's my 25th consecutive year.
Perlmutter loves the '80s.
You sure? They weren't specific.
It was in Wilson's bag.
Wait, you didn't really take that seriously, did you? I just wrote that for the money.
Sorry, we were just about to hit the floor.
I'm okay. As long as you don't expect rhythm.
You remember the last time we danced? Med school, the week we met.
I saw you in endocrinology. Tracked you down to the hoedown.
Ah.
(chuckling) I'd forgotten you knew how to party.
Because Professor Siegal covered the same ground and was the easier grader.
And one thing led to another.
I was gonna call you.
I was gonna come see you. Figure out where things would go from there. That was the morning I got the call from the Dean and I was expelled
(waking up) It’s 7:00 in the morning. Somebody better be dead.
Oh. (sitting up ) Under the circumstances, that's the best thing that could have happened, right?
(He takes a bottle of water off the nightstand and gets out of bed) Yes, and it was almost 9:30.
We've moved on to a new phase. I tell Cuddy that I've always
Interesting reflex of guilt just now. Your patient's been dying for six weeks. You couldn't have predicted he'd go this weekend. Or could you?
(reading from Wilson’s computer) "Euthanasia: let's tell the truth. We all do it." That's a great opening line. Are you insane?
Whoa... I was just thinking of your career. But yeah, if you're one of the doctors occasionally indicted, I guess it could affect that.
Someone should say that... in an unsigned letter
Who cares? The oncology department is subsidized by drug companies. They don't want it run by a murderer.
And once again, who cares? You won't be hirable anywhere.
Yeah, it's worked out great for me.
(holding out a bag of pretzels) Pretzel?
Studies show that $10 wine tastes better if you're told that it costs $90. I'm sure the same thing must be true of grape soda. (He pours grape soda into two glasses) Have one. We can toast your pending unemployment.
I didn't know Angela Merkel was attending the conference.
I can't convince her that I've changed my entire personality in a weekend.
What does she need?
Fjords.
You tell me that I've gotta show her I've changed, and yet you act like
Words can hurt, you know.
It's quiet in there. Is Rachel asleep? I thought maybe, you could use a babysitter.
Oh. Great. Maybe later.
Hey, Lucas.
A bit. That awkwardness would probably go away if I left. (He turns and leaves the room)
Dr. Wilson has asked me to tender his apologies for his absence. You'll be hearing my paper instead. Unfortunately, there wasn't time to correct the program schedule.
(reading Wilson’s paper) "Euthanasia: "let's tell the truth. We all do it. We just don't talk about it. We play the game. We use other words or we don't use any words at all.”
Hmm. Nice phrasing.
“Patient S, a 55-year-old man. End-stage lung cancer. His pain was beyond the point where we could even pretend to treat it. I showed him how to use the morphine pump. I told him too much morphine would kill him, but not to worry. The machine only gives out so much. To override it you need to enter a special code. I went to the door and told the nurse, 'the code is 328.' I said it loudly. (He pauses and looks up at the audience. He looks down again and does not see Wilson enter the room) When he first came to my office, I told him I would be with him every step of the way. But I left him alone at the end. I broke that promise. To cover my ass, I failed –"
I was wrong when I wrote that. I've never given any less than my best. I am incapable of turning away from a responsibility. My friends take advantage
(reading again from Wilson’s paper) "This is a burden no one should have to carry alone. And this is a decision no one should make alone."
Because frankly, I don't trust all of you.
Thanks for the message. Continue.
(taking off his tie) You wanted the paper out there, it's out there. And your job is safe.
I'm waiting for you to name something new to our relationship. You've got no good reason to be angry with me.
If this was about getting the story out there, then yeah. Of course, if this is actually about something else... Maybe you feeling impotent because patients keep dying and you think you need to make some grand, stupid gesture – You need to be a hero – Well, then, yeah, sorry. I did screw it up.
My God, there are 10,000 oncologists in this country. Every one of them loses patients. But only you would feel guilty enough...
(speaking into his phone) It's House. Take down the bags.
It's not the meds. It's the blood that's killing her. What's everybody doing? You're stunned, right? I mean, blood?
Is that the mom? I've got a good comeback if it's the mom.
Sure, she needs blood, if you want to kill her. Then you'd have nobody left to neglect – great plan. Your daughter has vibrio vulnificus, courtesy of a few scrumptious oysters on the half shell.
Thus proving that she did. Boy, that's neat.
Is that the dad? I've got a good comeback –
Oh, I thought the dad might've been Australian too. There was nothing wrong with the oysters. All oysters have vibrio. But almost no one has hemochromatosis. It'd give her a unique susceptibility to vibrio, cause the swollen joints. But it got attributed to bulimia, so she got supplements—
Which overcooked the liver, which caused bleeding. More blood, more iron, more bleeding, more blood.
Only if we give her high-dose ceftazidime for the vibrio and chelate for the hemochromatosis. Now, Cameron, pick up the phone and give me a dramatic exit. (Cameron picks up the phone and disconnects the call)
So...how'd you two crazy kids hook up?
And one thing leads to another. (long pause) Why keep it a secret? You protecting me in my fragile state? You think I was an unhinged looney who was about to go off the rails at a badly timed bit of news?
A ginger ale would be good. With lemon.
He looks like a guy who'd be there every day. Minibar is restocked. I say we grab some pretzels for the road –
Yeah, you should let her know that I drugged you so you wouldn't confess to murder. Let's get out of here. (They turn and begin walking toward the steps)
First U.S. conference I've attended in 15 years.
Toronto, all weekend. Airtight alibi.
Or... porn actor Hank Hardwick, born Henry Lefkowitz, totally clean workup, collapsed on the job with extreme photophobia.
Yeah. Let's wait till Chase and Cameron get here. I have a feeling they'll have the good sense to side with me.
Oh, good. You paged the limpness specialist. [She hands him a plain, white envelope.] This envelope is oddly medical license-shaped.
That's kind of sudden. Unless you've been circulating your resumes for a while.
Moving too. Interesting.
Run an STD panel and a tox screen. Send a C-reactive protein to look for inflammation and an A.N.A. to screen for autoimmune. The rest of you take a history and do an LP to rule out viral encephalitis. [He turns and sees Foreman sitting alone.] Oh, it's just you. Here's hoping you're good at multitasking. [He takes his license and coffee and heads for his office.]
Jew with megalophallus, photophobia, and muscle spasm. You tell me which is the most unusual. [He starts taking pictures with a camera just out of sight. He’s in Taub’s office. The camera is set up to take “before” pictures of plastic surgery patients.] Four candidates, three slots on the team. Need to know if you've still got your diagnostic chops.
Yeah, I agree. Does sound pretty dull. No wonder you want to work for me. Tox screen was clean, We ruled out viral encephalitis. [Taub smiles pleasantly and says nothing.] The only obstacle to you coming back is your wife. Which has never been that much of an obstacle to you.
Taub seems to think the link has to be the brain, but eye and muscle are governed by different parts of the patient's second-favorite organ. [Thirteen is leaning against her open door, keeping him in the hallway.] Which means it's...
Of course. Yes. It has to be multifocal.
Back-up plan's fine. But Taub's swinging for the fences. I suggest you don't divide your attention.
Taub thinks it's a brain issue, Thirteen thinks it's multifocal.
Don't take their word for it. Taub's problem is his wife, Thirteen's problem is you. Chase and Cameron's problem is the dead African dictator. None of them has a problem with the work.
[nods] Steroids to treat, brain angiogram to confirm, EMG and nerve biopsy while you're at it. I'll be at lunch.
[to Wilson] I'd hire all four, but a five-person team seems unwieldy. Who would you turn down? [to cashier] I'll have whatever he's buying.
They don't because their lives are irrelevantly and annoyingly complicated, which makes them confused, which makes them make poor decisions.
So I had an attraction of sorts.
And I got help. And she got Lucas, who bought me a ginger ale. It's all fine. Which won't be true of my department unless I can figure out which doctor I’m not hiring.
[interested] What is the worst thing I could do?
And you're back in my office. So much for playing hard to get.
He's not without talent.
But isn't. No sign of shock. No drop in blood pressure.
Right, 'cause Cameron thinks pornography is evil.
The ball and chain smacked you down.
Start the patient on heparin for the D.I.C. broad-spectrum antibiotics for the meningococcemia. [Chase and Foreman leave, followed by Cameron.] Dr. Cameron. [She stops.] Chase is relaxed, at ease, in lockstep with you again. I guess he finally told you that he iced Idi Amin Junior. Does that mean he can break the other nine commandments too? Taking the Lord's name in vain, sure, but coveting thy neighbor's wife? Is she hot?
Not for murder. Not you. Doesn't matter how evil Dibala was. By every conscience-hugging, Mother Teresa-loving bone in your body, you should be leaving him, not leaving with him.
We're not talking about my position, we're talking about yours, which doesn't add up.
I don't want that. But we'd be foolish not to plan ahead. A: my firing Chase was the only reason you left two years ago, B: when the full horror of his homicide hits you, your marriage will blow up. And Z... The only obstacle to you working here will be gone. Or maybe I skipped a couple of letters.
[dropping the magazine he had his nose buried in] Yes. I'm really happy with what the last guy did with my eyes. But why would broad-spectrum antibiotics fail to work on meningococcemia?
Had to do something to amuse myself while your receptionist fought with her boyfriend.
A guy who needs two decades' worth of corn chips Hoovered out of his neck, or a guy who can't stand daylight, and whose blood won't clot. You do the triage.
But you're not content with content. That's why you got sucked into those stock scams, why you cheated on the wife you love.
Why you worked on a case last time I was here.
But you'd knock over three other doctors to give it to him. Metaphorically speaking, you're a Heimlich addict.
You have a tight schedule of nose jobs and tummy tucks.
Nice. Tell me that didn't feel good. [leaving] See you tomorrow.
I owe you an apology. I was wr-rr-r... I was wrr-r-rr...
You spent weeks elaborately concealing the fact that you... [decides to use a euphemism for the others present] crashed daddy's car. And then you just confessed. Seemed idiotic. Certain to end in disaster. Instead you're riding off into the sunset together. Any theories on why?
Well, it's possible. It would require the presupposition that everything she's done for the last six years has been completely inconsistent with her character, but yeah, it's possible.
Or there's another explanation. Since you don't have one, I’m gonna keep looking for you. [He turns the intercom off with his cane.]
[at the window by the coffee maker] No matter how much you finish each other's sentences, don't count on being a diagnostic package deal.
[loudly, overacting] Enough! Enough! Stop pummeling Thirteen and Taub. [normally] It fits. Prep the patient for an ERCP. See if there's any hope of opening his blocked bile channels. And tell him to start looking for a liver donor. [Chase starts to follow the other two out] Dr. Chase. Your turn. So what'd she say?
That works too.
Only if you're interested. Only if you have doubts about her answer. [Chase turns to leave.] She thinks that you don't have anything to feel guilty about, because you didn't kill anybody. I did. She blames me for Dibala's murder, not you.
But I created the big, bad, evil climate that allowed it to happen.
Powerful counter-argument.
You got the tense wrong. Things are already screwed up. Which is why you don't just want to work for me, you need to. Cameron thinks you're my personal sock puppet. If you don't stay, it's gonna be hard to prove you're not. I have to go.
[to the guy on the next treadmill] Last week, my cane could only do ten minutes.
Waiting for you to take a nap so I can surge into the lead. [She walks away. He stops walking and slides off the end of the treadmill, both feet hitting the floor simultaneously. He follows her to a machine.] What's the best way to restore the liver in someone with sclerosing cholangitis?
You already are.
You're doing core training. Which improves balance, which staves off the most debilitating symptoms of Huntington's. You've ended your self-destructive streak. Want to do something significant, something that'll last longer than the few years you have left. My team is your first-best choice.
Absolutely, you should do that. Three hours a week. Every doctor should 'cause every doctor can. But you don't want to be every doctor. Plus, on my team, you get to screw with Foreman. Every way but literally.
See, this is why you'd be miserable wiping noses in a clinic.
Are you asking me to ask you?
No, neck veins are flat, precordial exam was normal.
Lymphoma it is. Prep him for chemo. Fax Taub and Thirteen the latest update on the case.
They have as much right to know as anyone on the team.
My strategy's not completely working. All four of them want to work for me, but all four of them have reasons why they don't want to work for me. How do I get them to take one from column A and none from column B? [Wilson is looking for something and not answering House.] Right. Right, by not saying anything, you're saying that the answer is inside me.
Then it's not technically the answer.
Because I know they're good. Other doctors fall into the "might be good" category.
Oh, my God, you're right. I don't need doctors at all. I just need a good friend. [He turns his head and “cries,” holding his hand to his mouth.]
Would've been more profound if you hadn't said anything.
Long passes, wild guesses, anything.
If his thyroid hormone wasn't completely normal.
Renal ultrasound was clean.
Ablate the patient's bone marrow. Find him a donor match.
Well, then come up with something better. [Cameron sighs.] He may as well die while we're treating him. [He heads to his office.] Okay with you if I bring the other candidates into the loop now?
Trust me, the case is almost over.
So do I.
You think that's gonna save your marriage?
Four candidates, three spots. I got a tough decision ahead of me.
'Cause I think we're wrong. Which means something's gonna go wrong. [His cell phone rings.] Or right. Takayama here.
Because?
So his life of filth wasn't the problem. Clean living was. Let's start him on methylprednisolone.
Worms. Cool, huh? [He hangs up the phone and gestures to Chase, Cameron and Foreman.] Best out of three?
Good news for your wife.
Or you love her more. This job gives you the thrill you used to find through philandering. Better to cheat with a beaker and an MRI than one of your platinum-blonde plastic surgery patients. I'll let you know.
[quietly] Four for four.
If almost not saving his life means –
Another one?
I taught you to think for yourselves.
As you celebrate their humanity, I'd rather solve those little puzzles and save their lives.
The patient is alive. That's what matters.
Your husband killed a patient and you're breaking up with me.
Any idea where I can get a great, big "Mission Accomplished" banner? Got my sanity back, my license back, and now...
Three out of four. Which is almost as good as four out of five.
Cameron.
Yeah, it is. She's broken up with Chase, and she's leaving the hospital. Still, three out of four ain't bad.
Put it on Dr. Wilson's tab.
Do you know who I am?
Good.
Thanks. Although I should make it clear that for two bucks all you get is top half, over the clothes. Any plans for turkey day?
Just making pleasant conversation. I've heard tell of folks doing such.
Great.
Sure. There's no point in putting a band together if we're not gonna play any gigs.
That was the old me. New me is static-guarded and friction-free. [He turns and walks away.] Enjoy your drumstick.
Ready to save some lives? [He throws the file on the table.] 32-year-old courier. Ataxia, anemia, mild cough. CT was clear. Tox screen negative.
Why wouldn't I be? Got all my starters back, plus a couple of first-class free agents. I feel like Mike Tomlin. [He looks at Foreman.] Probably not as much as you do, but you get the idea. [He takes a bite of his bagel.]
No fever, lymph glands were normal. Anybody seen Wilson?
[scoffing as he heads for his office] Yeah, like that's a real thing.
Anemia's a stretch. [picks up his phone] Page Dr. James Wilson at 558.
Come on. We get the tennis elbow and all the money. Let them have sickle cell.
You didn't agree with him. That's why he dumped you. Oh, sorry. It was mutual.
Sounds passionate.
One big, happy family. TTP it is. Confirm with a blood smear and adamts13 antibodies.
[ducking to look through a door then moving on] Good. Now what?
So?
Yes, it does.
Wilson?
Do you know where he is?
Is that what a "splenectomy" is? I thought it was an ice cream treat. Yuck.
Yeah, like I have time for games.
Isn't it obvious? I'm fishing for a dinner invite.
Missed you at breakfast this morning. And lunch.
[joining Wilson] You know where Cuddy's sister lives?
I've decided what I’m gonna do about Cuddy and Lucas. I'm going to break them up.
Ehhhhh. I think of it more as benevolent. There's only two possible outcomes for their relationship. They split, or they stay together forever. If it's split, then the sooner it happens the better for everyone. If it's stay, then my meddling won't matter. [elevator bell dings] In fact, if they survive it, it might even make their bond stronger.
And I’ve decided to do it at Thanksgiving dinner. Just 'cause I’m sentimental. Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's, which brings us back –
I fished for an invite. Cuddy wasn't biting, so I'll have to crash.
Ask and thou shalt receive.
Not help me, help Cuddy, remember? If you don't get it, I'll be forced to use more nefarious methods.
[spitting a pencil from his mouth into his hand] Good news is it turns out to be an exciting, action-packed thrill ride of a case after all.
[picks up the phone and dials] Thank God he's still got his appendix and tonsils. So what looks like TTP, acts like TTP, tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?
Hi, I’m Greg House, a friend of your sister, Lisa.
Lisa Cuddy. Sorry. Wrong number. [hangs up]
Can't be DIC. No hemorrhaging. And I’m calling all 12 Julia Cuddys within a 100-mile radius.
[on the phone again] Hey, Julia. You're, uh – you're Lisa's sister, right? You sure? 'Cause you are number 12.
[hanging up] Probably kept her first name.
Well, you two do an unstandard tox screen; you two search his home. Otis Campbell's got to be hiding somewhere.
As have you, Diana. Be well.
Figured you might be getting backed up. The holiday season and all.
I have always loved to travel. And paint. Lucky number seven.
Wow. Sexy and smart. Lucas is a lucky guy.
[pause. exaggerated curiosity] So which is it? I’m dying to know.
Peace in our time. It cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty. [He hands the paper to Wilson.]
You think she'd send me to a vacant lot for Thanksgiving dinner?
She is. That's why I ran it through motor vehicles. Good as gold.
I don't want it to end well. You should come as my date. You're not gonna want to miss this.
Makes me look adorably non-threatening. Party [brown and orange] or party hearty [white and tan]?
[tossing the white and tan tie and putting the other one on] So guy's a brainiac, and his secret drug of choice is booze? That's kind of pedestrian, don't you think?
Yes, assuming the biopsy's gonna tell us exactly what we expect it to tell us, it can wait till after New Year's. On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen can do the liver biopsy today.
Juniority. Welcome back.
Same as me. Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
Julia?
Key under the mat.
Oh, right. You need to replace one of your kitchen windows. I helped myself to your wine cellar. [He picks up an almost empty bottle of something.] I'll leave a buck on the way out. You're not right for her.
Less wrong.
Then I started thinking... [long pause while Lucas waits] What was I saying?
She invited me. She didn't know if she should. She was trying to figure out if I really have changed or... if I’m still the same old S.O.B. I've always been. But she always gave me a chance. 832 chances. And I used up every one of them. 832's her limit. Make a note.
I'm pathetic. I don't deserve her.
I love her.
I know there were a lot of consonants. [He winces slightly.] I don't remember how I got here, never mind what I said.
I was drunk. Whatever I said, he can't really –
It worked.
They split up this morning. You're the very first one I've told.
But her eyes say, "How will I ever pay you for that tennis lesson?"
They'll get over it.
I'll get over it faster than they do. [laughs slightly] Can't believe that Lucas fell for my "I never say this because it's so personal except that I’m drunk" profession of love. Second-oldest trick in the book.
[pause] He certainly is.
You're stupid.
He's not pedestrian, he's stupid. At least stupider than he should be. He's a DXM junkie.
He wasn't taking it for his cough. It's cheap, available at your corner drug store, and taken in high doses, it's a dumb drug.
He's smart compared to you. He's a moron compared to what he was. "Robotripping." Lowers the IQ. It also causes brain damage. Unless taken with the proper amount of ethanol. About one drink per day. He wasn't abusing the booze and taking the cough remedy medicinally. He was abusing the cough meds, and taking the booze medicinally. Bravo.
Long-term abuse of DXM explains all your symptoms. Even – oh, sweet irony – your cough. Whole bowel lavage, activated charcoal. We get all traces of it out of your system. You'll be the unhappiest little courier in no time. [He starts to leave.]
You'd be surprised what you can live without. Make him a genius.
Fainting, dizziness, shortness of breath?
Only on days that end in "day." Diarrhea, weight loss?
Yeah. once a week. How 'bout you? Stomach pain, tenderness?
Oh, yes! Don't think you're special. So we've got a lot of vague, unverifiable symptoms. Yet all the physical signs are perfectly normal.
I'm not sure, but I think it's... a lame job.
You're a rat. Insurance company sends you out to check on the quality of medical care.
Is it really? 'Cause you seem a lot more interested in asking questions than answering them. Handwriting on your medical records is obviously not a doctor's 'cause I can almost read it. And when you went out for a urine sample, I looked in your purse. Found the list of questions you were supposed to memorize before you came to the clinic. I was looking for gum.
Put it in your report. I tell you what. I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend that I’m not when we leave this room.
Remember, first ice, then heat. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to call me.
Wait a second. Where's Cuddy?
[He sees Ronnie leaving.] Hey, hey, hey! [She runs for the outer door.] Sorry. I can't remember if I've mocked you yet for being a male nurse.
Fair enough. [He leaves.]
Not a stroke.
Sorry to inconvenience you. Dying patients can be so thoughtless.
Great comeback. Is that Oscar Wilde? Come on, people.
Wouldn't produce schistocytes.
Gee, thanks for coming in. ANA was negative. [to Chase] What about you? Got any predictable drivel you'd like to add?
Well, at least they're trying. They're not just sitting there like roadkill. Give me something. Give me something, or I'll get your ex-smarter half on the phone and ask her.
Against the ottoman I tripped over?
I'm pretty sure the ottoman was acting alone. You free for dinner this weekend?
Mass hysteria. Either night?
Oh, my God, who got punched?
Chase couldn't have punched anyone. He was with me when I tripped over the ottoman. If you're not planning on eating this weekend, maybe a movie?
I need your help.
I was mowing the lawn when the phone rang. You're a computer. I’m gonna feed you data, and you analyze it.
I know. But I don't have anyone else to ask.
It's not that bad.
Not quickly.
Enjoy.
What's a conscience? [He starts to leave, then turns back.] Which ribs... did you break in the fall? They on the left side?
Gets absorbed by the spleen. Unless he doesn't have one. In which case it's absorbed by the liver, and fries that.
All organs do look kind of the same – red and squishy.
12 years, eight stories, and a dumpster ago, he broke three ribs, damaged his spleen. Bits of it split off, circulated through his bloodstream until they landed and attached somewhere else.
16 splenectomies. Pretty sure he gets a set of steak knives with that.
Guess I deserved it.
Your fist slipped?
So you busted my nose to keep people off your back.
Making people even more worried about you.
[slight nod] Fair enough.
Don't be so grateful. You'll be delivering packages for 70 years to pay for it.
So what're you gonna do?
[standing] Tell your brain I said good-bye.
Ignorance is bliss.
[rising] Dr. Cuddy. Can we at least be civil?
It's okay. Does your kid like animals? I got tickets to that holiday carnival. I hear they have a nice petting zoo.
I don't mean with me. Here. Take 'em. Enjoy.
They're not fake. I didn't steal them. One of the nurses was selling 'em for her kid's scout trip. I know it doesn't make things right between us, but I just wanted to do something nice.
Okay.
They didn't split up. She wouldn't take the tickets.
I wasn't gonna be there. She just felt guilty that I felt guilty, so she couldn't take them.
These weren't reparations. Just a simple gesture of remorse, and she slapped it down. They didn't break up. She just wanted me to think that so I’d back off.
Nothing. I said they'd either break up or they'd stay together. They didn't break up.
It is what it is.
[pulling the bandaid off] Aah.
 (singing) Well, I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body, I know not everybody has got a body like you.  Baaby.
 Got the urge to play last night.  Had to go all the way back to my apartment.  Thought I'd save on future trips.
 (looking at his watch) 6:33.  You should be flossing by now.
 Is it that time of year again?  He's a self-important jerk.
 He's a self-important jerk.
 Guy calls you Jim.  Doesn't even know your name.
 It's why I'm loved.  (to Chase and Thirteen) What am I doing here?
 Which means he's definitely not pregnant, right?
 Draw some blood.  (to Wilson, but not looking up from his phone) The self-important jerk does not have Transverse Myelitis.  He's got cancer.
 (closing his phone and finally looking up at Wilson) Okay.  Maybe I paid the redhead down in records a few bucks to CC me on all your cases.  A few patients die, you might get sad again.  Make a speech that would end your career.  Frankly, I'm stalking you for you.  (to Thirteen) How long does a simple blood draw take?
 Well, when you're finished almost finishing it, test it.
 Why rule out the hand of God so fast?
 (to Wilson) Your guy's low white count and right arm paralysis equals a recurrence of his leukemia.  Simple math.
 It's still cancer.  You know how I know?  He's got an oncologist for a doctor.
 I look for zebras because other doctors rule out all the horses.  In this case, you are those other doctors.  You haven't earned a zebra.  100 bucks.
 (standing up) Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer.  I get it.  Your problem is you're not objective.  Your caring is clouding your diagnosis.  Just cut that out and you could be a pretty decent doctor.
 (to Thirteen) Just give me the lactic acid level.
 (House nods and goes over to Juan) The fact that you can't speak English is not an excuse for you not being humiliated by what I'm about to say.  It's also not an excuse for you not telling us that you were a tennis pro.  If you had, we wouldn't have wasted our time.
 Hey.  Can a guy get a little privacy?
 Actually, it's perfect.  It allows me to hide from Cuddy and find you.  What did she want?
 That's it?
 No problem.  Just give me the 100 bucks you owe me and I'm gone.
 He doesn't have a ball of fungus in his lungs either.  Next time you want to use my team, I suggest you at least leave a tip.
 (pushing the intercom button with his cane and speaking to Chase) Why are you doing surgery when I need you finding me a new case?
 Oh, right.  Guess I'm here for Wilson.  Obviously you didn't tell me    that Cuddy was moving in with Lucas 'cause you were protecting me.  Which is odd since I told you that I'm fine with their relationship.  So obviously, you question one of those assumptions or you have an issue with logic.
 (scoffing) This is the 21st century, Wilson.  I realize that the logical course of any adult relationship could one day lead to fornication.  Although, the fact that she wants to buy a loft, could actually mean that their relationship is not as serious as I thought.
 If you bought into her diatribe about rediscovering her lost city girl roots.  And two bedrooms.  It just reeks of commitment issues.
 This is classic mid-life Cuddy crisis.  This is her version of a two-seat convertible.
 Hmm.  Obviously something is knocking out his immune system.  Three options.  HIV, acquired SCID, or my personal favorite, cancer.  I'm sure you'll test for all three. (House leaves.  Chase and Wilson look at each other)
 Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were in the middle of something.
 Your patient has cancer.  Not that guy.  Who probably also has cancer.  And he's probably also your buddy.  (handing Wilson a sheet of test results) Thought you'd want to know.  And you owe me 100 bucks.
 (stopping to hand Wilson a piece of paper) Revised OR schedule.  Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you.  It's not like your guy's bleeding out of his eyes.
 The nurse who books the OR thinks he is.
 (pushing through the doors of the surgical suite) Yeah, but you're way more patient.
 We just removed a screw from a guy's lung.  And the weird thing is he didn't get better.  Any idea what that means?
 No.  It means I'm ignoring you to make a point.  There is a difference.
 That your idea is implicitly not worth responding to.  Doubling your patient's chemo dose is stupid.  Damn, now it's explicit.
 The fact that it theoretically should work doesn't make it any less stupid.
 I'm me.  You're you.
 And chemo is poison.  And double chemo is double poison.  And I can handle it when things go wrong.  You can't.  And things could go very,
 Don't care.  I'm here because (looking at his watch) it's 1:15 and Wilson started testing at 12:45.  Which means...
 Look on the bright side.  You can publish the results of this case study.  No one will ever double the dose again.
 Hope he already told you that you're gonna die.  'Cause it's gonna make  what I'm about to say a lot more relevant.
 I was just in the ER, testing my patient for autonomic dysfunction.  It's the only department with a shower big enough for the whole team, plus the cardiac monitors, plus me.  Anyway, relevant part, we're just wheeling the guy out, trauma came in.  Motorcycle versus semi.
 Bad for the motorcycle.  Good for your liver.  Blood type's a match.
 Because there's a problem.  No organ donor card.  Dead guy's sister
 20 minutes away.  (House and Wilson rush out of the room)
 Did Cuddy buy the place?
 Just making conversation.  Yours was getting boring.
 I'm not planning anything.
 Okay, now this conversation is getting boring.
 (loudly) No!  I am not okay.  Not even close.
 No, it isn't.  It's just me accepting the fact that there's nothing I can do and moving on.
 Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun.
 Showtime.  (He gets out of the car and he and Wilson walk up the driveway)
 (approaching Aikoa) What if I told you that he wasn't dead?
 I'm saying you're being an idiot.  But I don't have time to talk you out of your religion so I'm stuck with giving you a technicality that will let you justify
 The last generous act of a living person.
 Well played.  Religion just killed another person.
 Late night with the Pigeon sisters?
 Someone's cranky.  (looking at his watch) And late.  Where were you?
 I needed room for my margarita jello shots.  I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.
 Why'd you go out drinking alone when you got such great company here?
 And you were out drinking.  So you're actually considering this?
 (standing up) Your mouth says no, but your pathetic attempt at a deflection has guilt written all over it.
 You cured his cancer.
 Quibbles.
 He's had a predictable complication.  Surprise.  Bad things happen to people who are sick.  Doesn't make you responsible.
 A table is a table.  Don't be a doormat, Wilson.
 (rising) Why?
 I'm your friend.  All the pain pills I've taken.  What if I need your liver?
 They're all dying.  They're all your friends.
 No, right, that's room 12A.  So why are you here?  Want to make sure that I’ve called the moving van?
 No.
 (looking Wilson right in the eye and sounding emotionally vulnerable) Because if you die, I'm alone. (He looks away and sits back down behind his desk, rubbing his leg)
 (taking off his glasses and putting them in his shirt pocket) You ready to admit that he's a self-important jerk?
 You don't feel angry?
 Disappointment is anger for wimps.  You don't have to be so gentle about everything.  It's okay to get angry once in a while.
 Actually, you can.  Just need a coat of paint and the guts to use it.
 You're gonna outbid her?
 You got mad.  I'm proud of you.  Cuddy won't share that sentiment.  How are you gonna explain it to her?
 (looking around at the fireplace and the large windows) She'll find out eventually.
 Baby steps.
Assuming you did this shaving your forehead... Okay, then. I'm ordering a head C.T.
Actually, stitching you up is really the E.R. doc's job.
Yeah. Also, a lot of cops in the E.R. [pause] Not that you care about that. So how did this happen? [looks from Mickey to Eddie] Yeah, you're right. That was a stupid question. 'Cause the answer's kind of obvious. No scrapes on your hands means you didn't try to break your fall. Means either out cold or totally disoriented when you went down. No sign of trauma other than the cut means no one hit you in the head. Powder burn on your jacket sleeve means someone shot a gun.
I don't care what you guys are into. If you don't get this checked out, it'll happen again.
This. [He slams his cane against the paper-covered exam table. It makes an explosively loud “crack” sound. Mickey and Eddie stare at House for a seconds then Mickey crumples to the floor. House peers over the exam table at him.] Cool.
32-year-old man, recent developed loud-noise-induced vertigo. C.T. was clean. No internal bleeding, no edema. Everything else is in the file. [He sits then leans toward Chase.] Cameron get your hair in the divorce?
Yes, he won't tell us anything. Understandable, since he's a drug dealer.
Not out loud. But he was wearing a solid gold Patek Philippe. His friend had a Rolex. But their phones were prepaid burners, so they can toss 'em as soon as they're done.
Acoustic neuroma fits. So does lidocaine toxicity. Or benzocaine – depends what he's cutting the coke with.
He seemed peppy. You test his ears. I'm gonna go test his cocaine.
I hope not.
I need the drugs.
[screams, his face furrowing down the center in a very good imitation of Sabretooth from X-men] I need the drugs! Hmm... works for Jack Bauer.
But way less genre-appropriate. Okay, here's the deal. I need information. You have reasons not to give me that information. So either I can force it out of you... [Eddie looks skeptical] or I can't.
Okay... Well, let's work with that. Forget the drugs. Let's talk about textiles. What's your major product? Is it "h"? And by that I mean "hosiery."
Is that with a "c" or a "k"?
Does your friend cut the fabric?
Well, he must cut a culotte here and there.
[walking over] I'm interrogating a suspect. Make it quick.
We're grown men over the age of 30 who moved in together. We're two tigers away from an act in Vegas. They'll figure out we're straight eventually.
If only there was some way to communicate that information to her. Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds. If only the larynx was capable of –
And a woman would only reject you because she's worried that you might not be interested in her.
When she thought you were gay. [to Eddie]You sure your friend isn't secretly tr – [turns back to Wilson] What is a culotte, anyway?
It's an ear test. Pretty sure he'll live.
[whining] But we're doctors all the time. It's so boring. [speaking normally] Fine.
Get an ultrasound of his carotids. See if his arteries are clogged.
Our patient sleeps in the building where they keep their stash. Eventually, he'll say something that gives away where that is. And we'll find out what's making him sick.
You ruled out environmental causes.
Carotid stenosis was a decent idea. But an even decent-er idea is that he's got toxins stored in his fat cells. Every calorie he burns makes him sicker.
Tell him it'll take weeks. It'll be faster.
3-B? You're Nora, right? My roommate tells me you're the one to thank for all the tips about the neighborhood. Greg.
I hear you thought that Wilson and I liked to polish each other's swords. And by swords, I mean pistols.
Oh, don't worry. Actually, I'm surprised that doesn't happen more often. We're both straight. [There’s a flat package, about 6 feet tall, wrapped in brown paper, leaning against the wall. House rips the paper off. It’s an enormous, framed poster from “A Chorus Line.” House steps back and clasps both hands and his mouth, admiring it.] Oh, my... God, that is beautiful. [to Nora] We finally have the room to display it the way it deserves. Would you – would you help me get this upstairs?
Nice shoes, by the way. Louboutin?
No, it doesn't. Where's Foreman?
True, amusing, and irrelevant. Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?
Mazel tov. Should be fun to watch.
Wherever he went, it wasn't for long enough. Add in the fever and infection's way more likely. And if it is an infection, his symptoms suggest it's moved to his brain. Which means...
The London and New York recordings are so different.
She didn't believe me, either.
Correction – I started doing this to mess with you. Now I'm honestly trying to hit that.
[standing] We're in a relationship and we're really unhappy. Communication's never been easy for us. Probably 'cause we're so closeted. I got it all figured out. Nora and I spend the next few weeks hanging out, become best girlfriends. I confide in her about our issues.
Then, one night, we get drunk... back rub turns into a front rub... The next morning, "I've never felt this way about a woman before."
I'd like to date her. In the sense that I'd like to jump her repeatedly.
Seriously? You're invoking the guy code?
You're only bringing this up 'cause you know you're gonna lose.
The hair is still bumping me. Did you get it cut because you're ready for the next chapter or –
That would be a mistake.
[over his shoulder] Well, then, you got nothing to worry about, sweetie.
You're a wuss.
What, are you gonna beat me up? That sounds stressful. Maybe you should pop one of your beta blockers first.
Medically, no. He would have told us about that. Metaphorically...
When was your last pill before we originally admitted you?
And we stuck you in here, and you went into beta blocker withdrawal. That's what caused the hypertension. When he got out of here, he took another pill, and the hypertension went away. Which means it was never a symptom. We take that off the table, we've got vertigo, fever...
Pheochromocytoma.
It's Greek for, "You'll be back doing bad things to good people in no time." [to Chase] M.R.I. his adrenal glands. You're okay with that, right? You're not gonna put a pillow over his face?
We're having a picnic... with wine.
He doesn't drink.
[to Thirteen] That receiver doesn't respond to manual stimulation. Maybe if you took off your shirt.
There's got to be at least one open frequency.
I need a few minutes with your friend. Or stay if you want. [He grabs a rubber glove and waves it around.] Rectal exam.
[dropping the glove on the bed] Why the beta blockers?
Valium and Xanax actually reduce stress. Beta blockers just control the symptoms of stress.
Keep the heart from racing, hands from shaking, and all those stage fright issues. That's why some people take them when they perform.
This is my bug. [He puts it in his pocket.] And this... [reaching between the pillows on the bed]
This... This is yours. [He pulls out another one.]
An informant would have sold his pals out to us at the first sign of a sniffle. This guy... is a cop.
In the land of no fun, you got a really sensible piece of property.
Good point. You know what they say. Information is not power. Wait...
And the moron still won't talk.
Pretty much.
I'm sure the dealers who take their places will be very grateful.
Got a better idea?
The jealousy is... killing me.
Why can't he show it in a – in a normal way? I'm so tired of... the whole silence and the resentment. I don't know if I can go back there tonight. [Dean Martin's "Sway" playing] [voice breaking] I need some time.
Really?
That would – that would be... It would be such a help. Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Nothing you can say is going to change anything.
Wow. This is unexpected.
No – no, no, no.
Looks like somebody missed something. Which is embarrassing for somebody.
Somebody's got a good point.
[staring at the scans] Do it.
Kind of a bad time.
Right. [He mumbles something as he gestures for her to have a seat.] This whole thing with Wilson... It's all my fault. We're not closeted, because we're not gay. [She smiles, disbelieving.] For real. [She stops smiling.] Wilson thought you were cute, and I was just yanking his chain. Maybe that's not the best phrasing.
God, no. I was spending time with you because I want to touch your boobs. [She puts her hand to her chest.] Enough to listen to Evita, twice. And I really hate Evita. That's how much I like your boobs. [She puts down her hand and stands to go.] Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. [He gets up and comes to her.] Wilson... he's a really good guy. And he really likes you.
Wilson's a jerk too.
He's been divorced three times. He slept with a dying patient. Sure, he looks like a boy scout, but then...
The aneurysms look mycotic, but they're not. They're inflammatory. Because this is not a fungal infection. The hypertension was a real symptom. You've been unwittingly treating it with beta blockers. You stopped taking them, and your blood pressure went up. It's Hughes-Stovin.
If you die in the next day or so, I will be.
He died a hero in his own mind. Guess it's better than nothing.
Mendacious dirt bag comes much more naturally to me. Least we can get rid of that. [He gestures at the A Chorus Line poster.]
It's 500 bucks. And... [he pulls a lever on the side] it reclines.
I will punch you in the face.
[glares at him] No chance.
 Tell her to stop lurking in the front row.  If she wants to hit on musicians that's what tour buses are for.  Next.
 Try it.  Try it.
 Tell him to masturbate, no more than 3 times daily.  With meals.  Next.
 Wild guess, he's rich.
 (holding out his hand) Gimme...
 No, that would be an accident of genetics.  It's because she's hot and her husband is ugly.  It's a fascinating window into the mysteries of human psychology.  Also, she's really hot.
 (reading the file) She loves something about him.
 It's not the ear, it's the heart.  Her protein is cheese, which can raise cholesterol.  Hers was already elevated.  Gave her arterial blockages.
 So, beauty and the beast.  (He hands the file back to Chase) Who wants to go see?  (House’s phone rings)
 (rolling over) Got to avoid my natural habitat.  Some idiot I went to med school with keeps leaving messages and wants to drop by for lunch.
 It's complicated.
 A few months ago he was... sort of part of my therapy.  My shrink told me to write a letter of apology to someone I hurt.
 We were in a seminar on flatworm genetics.  I switched my final paper with his.
 I was testing a theory.  I thought that our professor was biased against me.  I assumed he'd get a high grade with my paper and I'd get a low grade with his.  Interestingly, I was wrong.  I got an "A.”
 Yep.  Lorenzo Wibberly.
 Not everyone has a name that's so easy to find in the white pages.
 Yeah.  And yet, I picked him.  It's funny, isn't it?
 (loudly) We said we'd never go to sleep angry.
 Undisclosed location.
 (looking at two framed photos on the coffee table) Wilson.  And the lunch date that Wilson is, no doubt, right now trying to sic on me.  But in the great game of chess that is our relationship, Wilson sees only one move ahead.   (He sits up and picks up the photos) I see dozens.  That is why he will never mate me.  (When there is no response from the team, House clarifies) That's a chess term.
 So he's poisoning her.
 (riffling through Cuddy’s desk drawers) Does he have dry skin?  Thin eyebrows?  If you're sharing an amazed look, please do it louder.
 If he has hypothyroidism and he dumped his meds in her coffee, that would make her heart go boom.  (taking one of the photos out of the frame) In a bad way.
 (taking the other photo out of its frame) And she's hot.
 Yeah, Foreman.  Why did you break up with Thirteen?  Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual thing she was saying, why that?
 Great, start her on beta blockers.
 (to himself) Check, and mate.
 (looking uncomfortable) Thanks.  So where are you working these days?  You got your own practice or you at a hospital?
 As an in house doctor?
 Why didn't you graduate?
 (almost afraid to ask) Which credit?
 (hopefully) So I'm guessing you're the CEO of this supermarket chain?
 Psychopaths always fascinate me.  I think it's their cultural literacy and strong family values.  Or is that Jews?
 Hmm.  I got an idea.  (to Bill) Can you get out of here?  Thanks.  (Bill leaves.  House looks at Foreman) It was the "thanks" that did it.
 (to Valerie) Hi, I'm Dr. House.  How long have you been a psychopath?
 Psychopathy can get a bad rap.  It doesn't necessarily mean you're violent.  Just that you're completely without conscience, you lack any normal emotion, you manipulate everyone around you, you're promiscuous, you lie pathologically.  Any of this ringing bells?
 Yeah – though you have Darwin to thank for that.  She got the creeps around you.  Which oddly, is an actual medical phenomenon around psychopaths.  Probably an evolved response to predators.
 Relax.  We have a duty of confidentiality.  And you have an undiagnosed heart problem that could kill you at any moment.  We believe that your mental abnormality is related to your physical one.  So if you want to keep on predating...
 You sure you understand what the word "no" means?
 Told you he was rich.  She's not that weird.
 Tell me about it.  Some of my co-workers will insult people right to their faces.  How long have you been this way?
 So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia.  Go.
 Two rare conditions in one patient, it's a fair assumption they are.
 Her disease isn't gonna lie dormant that long.  Did her heart warp her brain?
 It'll be super awesome when we find it.  (He stops in front of the elevator and pushes the button)
 Fits best.  Start her on penicillin, and rule out Wilson's and Hashimoto's.  There's your handful.  Wasn't so hard, was it?
 Yes, and she got it right and you got it wrong.
 You're her boss.  In some vague, never to be usefully defined way.  You punish her.
 The fact that you also fired her takes it from a little complicated to a little moronic.
 It wasn't because you were too in love with her.  It was because you were too in love with your career.  We're almost at my floor so I'll summarize.  Your problem, not mine. (He gets off the elevator)
 That rare daguerreotype.  You can charge me for the effort it takes to search your hard drive for a new copy.
 Right.  I had forgotten your deep emotional attachment to lemurs.
 You got his tail?
 Well, I could stand here all day apologizing, but I'd rather expiate my sins with good clean work.
 You ignoring my texts?
 También de la medicina (Also of medicine.)  Doctor Wilson me llamó a una consulta (Dr. Wilson called me in on a consult.)
 Wibberly's got some agenda.  Probably trying to guilt me into getting him a better job.
 Not at all.  That's how I know he's got an agenda.
 Entonces no te lo hubieras golpeado (Then you shouldn’t have hit it.)
 No te preocupes. (Don’t worry.)  El Dr. Wilson es un muy buen médico.
 Quién tiene una enorme consideración por los pacientes por su propia batalla fatal con impotencia. (Dr. Wilson is a very good doctor.  Who has enormous empathy towards patients which stems from his own crippling battle with male sexual dysfunction.)
 All I'm responsible for is the foreseeable consequences of switching papers.  A bad grade or a sleepless night, worst case, a retest.  There was no way to know that one seminar paper was gonna destroy this idiot's life.
 Good point.  If he's happier, there's no harm done.  I'll go find out.
 (to Jose) Always with the modesty, this one.
 La siguiente vez que tu quieras drogarte secretamente y confundir tu dedo con un clavo, las gotas para los ojos son buen remedio, pero usa menos por eso es que estas llorando demasiado. (Next time you want to get secretly stoned at work and mistake your thumb for a nail?  Eyedrops are a good call, but use less, that’s why you’re tearing up so much.)
 I'm cool.  How's work?  You happy with it?
 Free time...  Wouldn't have any of that if you were a doctor.
 (looking out the sliding glass doors at the back of the house) Is that your yard?  That's nice.
 I don't have a yard, myself.  You got a good thing going.
 (looking around the living room) So what are the boxes for?
 From paradise?
 You're losing your home.
 How?
 (looking at a lab report and then putting it down on the table) Neither do I, but I know what happened after.  She called Cuddy and demanded that I kick you off the case.  I backed you up, because I trust you.  But you're gonna have to earn that trust now.
 There is that.  So, heart and kidneys.
 Nope, psychopathy is not a symptom.
 In the meantime, kidney failure ruled out syphilis and testing ruled out the other ideas that would've fit.
 Get her to radiotherapy.
 Those of you who haven't slept together, you can go.  Everyone else, stay behind.
 (to Foreman and Thirteen) Go have sex.
 Fine, I'll cover the Viagra and the lubricants.  Just get me a receipt.
 (rising from the chair) Well, that's too bad, 'cause things worked much better when you did.  Would it help if I slept with her?
 No, we were already at the diagnosis.  You were creating a fake argument about an irrelevant treatment issue, 'cause you can't stand to be around each other.  So have sex, fight or quit, I don't care.  Whatever you're doing now isn't working. (He picks up the file and goes to his office)
 Just checking in on your radiotherapy.
 I want to know how you like being a management consultant.  I'm thinking of getting into it.  That or psychopathy maybe.  Which pays better?
 I'm sure you understand what “joke” means.
 Of course I'm self-interested.  We all are.  We're born that way.  The rest of us are born with consciences.
 I'm not saying it's logical.  I'm just saying it's human.
 Great.  You be the clock.  Everyone else will be the doctors.  Heart, kidneys, now liver.
 That's our best guess.  Start her on steroids.
 Man, one false accusation from a psychopath, and you turned out to be a real bummer.  I'm gonna go see if Wilson has any liver left.
 Paying Wibberly's mortgage for a few months.  (He rips the check out of the book) Congratulations on another successful round of hectoring.
 No.  It's a giant novelty item for winning the lottery.  You're just standing really far away.
 (putting the check in an envelope) I don't know.  He just kinda smells good and makes me laugh.
 Maybe because I recognize that sending someone to the poorhouse is a little more serious than editing a snapshot.
 (addressing the envelope) Oy.  If it will make you shut up, I will tell her I'm sorry about the photo.
 She wasn't in love with me.
 (fed up, and leaning back in his chair) What do you want?  Helping the guy was your idea.
 You had me at "much easier."  I'm gonna pretend to go to work now.  (House bangs loudly on his keyboard, and pretends to return the carriage as if on an old typewriter)  Bing!  (Wilson, looking disgusted, leaves)
 So liver, heart, brain, can lie dormant, and, it starts at puberty.  (he pauses, thinking) The raw food diet made it go fulminant... Nuts are high in copper.  It's Wilson's Disease.
 There is one other sign.  I know there are lipstick lesbians.  Are there nail polish remover bisexuals?
 As a doctor.  You didn't say anything about her capacity as a beautician's assistant.
 Yep.  (to Thirteen) start her on chelation.
 Tax shelter.  I'll take some of that chili now.
 Fine.  Forget the chili.  Bye, Wibberly.  (House stands up to leave)
 Why are you telling me this now?
 (giving the check back to Wibberly) Keep it.
 Just take it.  I screwed you over.
 Take it.
 (yelling) Do I have to shove it down your throat?  (He pries open Wibberly’s hand and forces the check into it) Take the damn check!
Canoeing. But I seem to be taking on water.
No canoe in my bathroom. [deep breath] My leg hurts. Soaking it makes it feel better. You were the one who had to have this condo. Maybe next time you should consider amenities, like two full baths, instead of just the joy of outbidding Cuddy.
Well then, you owe me 35 bucks for the grab rail I installed.
Hit the kill screen. Boss is here.
Bummer.
Football player. Those are the ones that get hit in the head a lot, right?
So it's roid rage. You don't think they grow them that big naturally.
Only proving that our guy got his hands on the good stuff.
Why? He injects his sore ankles with lidocaine every game. You think he's above injecting steroids?
Fine. Bilateral venous sampling to find the elevated GnRH. MRI to find the pituitary damage. [The team starts to stand.] Unless, of course, there is no pituitary damage, in which case, our guy got his hands on the good stuff.
Foreman. Let the peasants handle the peasantry. Your brother needs to get picked up this afternoon... from prison. Your older brother, in case your confusion is related –
He left a message. Said he couldn't get you on your cell or at home. I get it. You're busy. You'll pick him up the next time he comes out of prison.
You're officially unbusy. Family is family. Take the rest of the day. Go see your brother.
There's nothing wrong with your eyes.
Or you enlisted, you got the cool haircut and the awesome pants, then you realized that your plane ticket to the Middle East was coach, and you decided to rethink your promise.
So our homeland should be unsafe because your private was unsafe.
I don't care about the fact that they don't care. [going to the door]
Why?
Viet?!? How old do you think I am?
Well, back in my day, the real dodgers had the stones to run up to Canada or shoot themselves in the foot. They didn't come to free clinics whining for doctors' notes. Go hug your wife. Tell her to get a babysitter. You'll be back in time to video the kid's first steps.
I don't need to see the scan. I can tell from your little puppy-dog eyes that his pituitary's fine. Are you gonna say it, or should I?
Next time with feeling. Put the cheater on a somatostatin analog to clear it out of his system. Send him back to his football game.
Oh, right. You two know each other.
Oh! Who are we kidding? Interview's over. You got the job.
My new assistant. Part of his parole – he needs a job. Just trying to do my part.
Family is family. [He nods for Marcus to go with Foreman.]
Well, if it was fine, it wouldn't go aflutter just 'cause you walked into the room.
Thank you, sir. [to Foreman] Judging by the look on your face, I assume you're upset that big bro didn't take your advice and skip town.
It was fun. [to Marcus] Put lunch in the books, just you and me.
Well, naturally, you jump right to a urinary issue.
It is? Hmm. Well, naturally, you think it's not a urinary issue, 'cause you're so embarrassed about your own past urinary issues, you don't dare broach the subject. [He takes a sip of his drink while Foreman stares at him, silently.] Oh, come on. You spending the night over at Bobby Samson's.
We're not buying it, Eric. We never bought it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let your brother speak. What happened to Hank Gathers?
Rage and tachycardia are warning signs.
Hey, I don't care where an idea comes from, as long as it makes sense and embarrasses someone.
As a former psychiatric patient, I take offense at that terminology.
Whatever happened to coherent conversation?
I have no idea. Everybody else thinks hypertrophic cardiomyopathy makes sense? [Foreman opens his mouth but doesn’t say anything.] Good. Stick the patient on a treadmill. Stress his heart until it stops.
Only real treatment is for the patient never to stress his heart again, which means we have to tell him to retire at the ripe old age of 21. Stopping his heart speaks louder than words. Go.
Because it's fun. Maybe you should give those bills to the guy who left his own bathroom window open.
I want to learn more about one of my employees so that I can manipulate him and destroy him if and when I choose. Information is power.
Okay. Why don't you tell me my real evil plan?
Oh, shut up. You can't accuse me of an opossum attack and underhanded kindness in the same visit.
Either we find a bigger treadmill... or... [grabs his jacket and leaves]
Did I miss the memo about you being released?
All excellent points. Give me your arm.
It's a vasodilator. Since we can't exercise your son's heart on the treadmill, I'm gonna have to do it chemically.
You're turning white.
It means he doesn't need football to get a good job anymore.
You really think a guy with stenosis could've aced that treadmill test?
[turning to look] And a nameplate. Man's got to have a place he can call his own.
Hang an ethanol drip.
If it's lymphoma, the ethanol will make him itchy, and Foreman can remove his spleen. If it's Takayasu's, he'll lose his radial pulse, and Chase can start him on steroids.
[hollers] Marcus!
He's busy spying on his little brother.
What?
You obviously have a theory as to why demeaning is not demeaning.
Do you even listen to yourself?
What's her cup size?
[exasperated] Oh! Seriously? I give you a choice between moving to Canada and shooting yourself in the foot, and you chose the bullet?
You think this is gonna get you discharged? We'll patch it up and send you right back.
Look… You got screwed over by your own government, and that sucks. But all you're gonna get out of this is a five-day vacation and a band-aid.
You got a girl pregnant. You're still just a guy.
Ahh.
Lying in wait. [He turns on the torchiere by his head.]
Right... Play innocent. Like you weren't looking for revenge for the prank that I didn't pull.
Of course you realize, this means war.
Wilson annexed the Sudetenland.
[hanging up his coat and taking the drink from Marcus] Kind of like the time you took your mom's birth control pills on a dare and ended up with swollen nipples.
Right, and your nickname all the way up through high school wasn't Erica.
It would also be accompanied by a significant decrease in muscle power. Marcus! A chance to redeem yourself. Does our patient look strong to you? [Marcus shrugs.] Sorry, Eric. Big brother disagrees with your diagnosis.
You said the liver was inflamed, not the spleen. Can you believe they let this guy perform surgery?
What are you doing?
Permission denied. Continue.
D’you think he's an idiot, Marcus?
Okay. Go test his blood. [The team packs up to leave. House turns to Marcus.] Come on. We have a lunch scheduled.
So, you jerked me around. Your allegiance lies with your brother. I get it. Admirable. But here's the problem. I hired you to tell me the truth. If you don't do that, you no longer have a job.
He was arrested for grand theft auto.
Try me.
Was it your idea?
So the problem is not in his blood, it's the blood itself.
I usually love breaking bad news. But in this case... start the patient on warfarin. [to Marcus, loudly as Foreman leaves, causing him to turn around and look] I'm so sorry about that. You were saying...
[listening intently] Wow. You got off easy.
Y–your mother's dead?
I had an epiphany.
[closes the door] Flathead screwdriver.
It's not a game. It's proof that you didn't rig the grab rail and make me fall.
I can't go on that. But I can go on the fact that I had to borrow a flathead screwdriver from Nora to install the thing, 'cause we only had a Phillips-head. And then, of course, I returned it late that night in a completely successful effort to see her braless...
Which means that you didn't have the tool to sabotage the grab rail.
Now I also have proof that I'm not responsible for the opossum, because I'm absolving you of responsibility instead of escalating, which you know is not my nature.
[ominously] The opossum... was meant for me.
Did you even go to college?
You see, that's just illogical, 'cause I'm staying up too.
I gave you empirical proof that I did not prank you.
I don't master-prank.
See, this is exactly what our nemesis wants – divide and conquer. Can't you see that?
I'm telling you, if you sleep now, you're gonna wake up next to severed horse heads. Or worse, the rest of it.
[smiling] Oh, this guy is good.
Zer is a reason for everything, mes amis. I am tro-bled to report that we have a criminal in our midst.
[still “French”] You each had motive. You each had opportunity.
Not so fast, Mademoiselle Cuddy. No one leaves here until they can account for their whereabouts on the evening last.
[normal voice] Okay, no one who is employed by me leaves here until they account for their whereabouts the evening last. What about you, Professor Chase?
Because you hold me responsible for breaking up your marriage.
Can either of you prove that?
For now. What about you, Colonel Taub?
Really? Your wife.
Good enough. [to Foreman who is smirking] 'Cause I had you pegged all along. You certainly had all the motive in the world.
Yesterday I confirmed that you are a liar.
Well, at least a liar by omission.
Get this, class. Foreman's mom died. He ever tell any of you?
And to top it off, you refused to say anything nice about her at the funeral.
You want to hit me, don't you?
Antibiotics aren't working. We're gonna switch you to different ones, but you're gonna lose your toe.
As a general rule, before you celebrate, do a little research. The army's medical evaluation board is perfectly fine with nine-toed infantrymen, as long as they can walk and run.
Well played. If only we could combine your medical chicanery with your brother's ability to fetch me mochas, you'd be the perfect Foreman. Where are you?
Actually, we do have a new symptom. Any of you take a look at his readmittance chart? Between the time he checked in and the time he rechecked in, our patient lost a single pound. Patient like that would usually shed over ten pounds.
We've eliminated lymphoma. What other cancers mimic growth hormone?
It was a rhetorical question. I don't really care. Go test him for all of them.
It's Foreman.
Well, that's the whole point –
Why don't you leave me out of this? Wilson was the one who bought the place.
Actually, I suffered more now that you just tripped me.
Why would you out yourself? You can't even imagine the retribution.
Maybe I was wrong about the weight loss.
What if it's not inside?
You know why you're black?
Hmm. What I was going for was melanin. You got lots of it. [He starts inspecting the palms of Daryl’s hands.] It makes your skin dark, protects you from the sun's harmful UV rays.
Unfortunately, it also prevents even those with advanced medical degrees from considering melanoma as a diagnosis. Other hand. [He examines Daryl’s left hand.] On the rare occasion that black people do get skin cancer, they usually get it on the white parts – palms and soles of the feet. [He pulls the blanket aside and starts checking Daryl’s feet.] But your hands and feet are so smashed up from football, my team are likely to have written off any skin blemish as a bruise. But now that I know that melanoma is the only thing that fits... Come take a look at this, Mom. [There’s a freckle between two of Daryl’s toes.] There's the thorn in the panther's paw. Paraneoplastic syndrome. Your body forms antibodies to fight the tumor. [CGI of the antibodies traveling through Daryl’s body.] Those tiny little proteins travel through your blood and wreak havoc. We remove the cancerous mole, everything should be fine. I'll tell Dr. Chase to schedule the surgery.
Did you study really, really hard? [Daryl gives him a “look.”] Then the same crappy life that the rest of the guys you'll be graduating with are gonna lead... minus the student loans.
That's nice for them.
I provoked Marcus to quit because he was no longer useful to me. I hired him to get information. I got information.
We're not.
 (approaching from behind) Hey, boss lady!  You don't answer emergency pages anymore?
 (following Cuddy toward her office) Turned out it wasn't a resistant staph, but I still say that if it had been, infecting him with malaria –
 (still following) You're lying.
 Not talking about your meeting.  I'm talking about the phone call.
 (catching the door with his cane and following her into the office) I was with your boytoy on a stakeout last night.
 He needed someone who could diagnose a soft tissue injury from across the street.  Apparently he doesn't know any good doctors.
 Things got a little slow, so we made some wagers.  One being whether I could get you to stop the miscegenation with an emergency page.
 He said you guys do it every morning.
 So you weren't actually –
 I'm gonna need a definitive answer before any money changes hands.
 Thought you had an important meeting.
 Go talk to Wilson about something completely unrelated and see what happens.  Mystery infection guy is now covered in boils and has an abscess big enough to put your fist in.  He needs to get into an OR tout suite.
 Good.  I'll have some hot chocolate waiting.  (House walks away)
 If you really wanted to make a deal, you should have ditched the push-up and gone with a demi.  Nothing makes a guy wanna close like high beams.
 Your meeting with the weasel lasted less than five minutes, which means you either agreed to a completely sensible 30-day extension or one of you issued a completely ridiculous ultimatum.
 (with a childish look on his face) Oh, goody.  You or him?
 Way to go, boss.
 Ridiculous to make, fun to watch.  As long as it's not just a bluff.  Please tell me it's not a bluff.
 Interesting.
 It's not.  It's not congestive heart failure.  It's gotta be...
 You ever noticed how many porn sites have "mom" in the domain name?  Hot moms, hungry moms, mature moms.  That ought to make you feel pretty good.
 Looks like boils, altered mental status, and heart failure was caused by renal cell carcinoma.  (handing her a form) I need your signature to start treating it with malaria.  Don't worry, I'm giving him chemo too.
 Just trying to play my part cutting costs.  Malaria is the simplest, cheapest method of delivering hypothermia.
 That doesn't sound like me.
 Okay, let me see if I've got this straight, a bet that puts one patient at minor risk is juvenile?
 But going all-in against Atlanticnet –
 (putting the form on her desk) I'm gonna put this in your inbox.  I just hope it doesn't get lost underneath all the other stuff you're carefully considering.  (He leaves.  Cuddy sits down at her desk and looks at her watch yet again)
 Hey.  (They talk as they walk toward Cuddy’s office) Know any good transplant surgeons?  Turns out his kidneys aren't the only thing failing.  And I know what you're thinking, but malaria wouldn't destroy his liver that fast, especially since we never infected him.
 Apparently Foreman now thinks that he has the authority to overrule my orders just because the FDA wouldn't approve.  Don't worry.  I'll deal with him.  If you could just talk to Hourani –
 (turning to face her) If you paged me during sex?
 It's all numbers.  Do the math, and nothing else.
 That's what they're supposed to do.
 (They continue walking) Putting your job on the line in an effort to stamp out stupidity isn't?
 Probably.  But then I also wanted to try to cure cancer by infecting a guy with malaria to win a $50 bet.  You really want to be like me?
 Would you rather I go back on vicodin?
 She will... Eventually.
 Its gonna take longer than a few days for a company the size of Atlanticnet to start feeling the squeeze of your PR Campaign.  If they ever do.
 I know they have a nascar team.  Despite what you may have learned at hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff, sometimes the bigger they are, The harder they kick your ass.
 I told them to use their words.
 The breast milk guy finally found a doctor to give him what he wanted.  If it works, it's way better than malaria.  It’s worth a shot.
 They're not gonna fire you.  And you're not gonna quit.
 Because you're an idiot.  (Cuddy looks over at him) This place needs you.  And that matters to you.
 She's a sociopath.
 No.  But have you seen the way she opens the mail?
 Figured it might come in handy one day.
Masturbating. I'd invite you, but people are already talking.
Right. Playing Dance Dance Revolution is a much better choice.
You can. But you can't get disc two with the director's commentary.
You mean you're dating on meth? Count me in.
Over a five-minute discussion of Proust? Speed dating's a meat market.
I thought I might do a little light doctoring in the afternoon.
Platelets look normal.
What does she blog? Politics? Dominatrix? Cooking? 'Cause I need recipes.
And knowing too much about each other is exactly why people leave small towns and move to the city.
Big red As for our tunics. Connections are for airports. For people, we have over 300 cable channels.
Eeny, meeny, miny, Thirteen and Tiny. [He goes back to his book.]
[to Wilson] You brought a date?
And he has to swim in ours? You go to a bar, you bring your ugly friends.
Life is a beauty pageant. Little girls who kiss frogs expect them to turn into you.
Yeah, you are.
The rest is your hair.
[smiling slightly] You wanna bet? [Chase cocks his head, listening] You can't tell anyone you're a doctor. You're unemployed. You're also a little slow, misunderstand everything they say. And lose the accent. A hundred bucks says you still walk out of here with a dozen names.
I'm a diagnostician. I find out what's wrong with people, and I fix it.
Yeah, but they can't dance like I can.
Check.
Quadruple check.
What, are you here at gunpoint? You need me to call 911?
[noticing the daily crossword puzzle she has on the table.] You like puzzles.
[looking around] Is there a fire alarm we could pull? Maybe get out of here.
Except... Maybe you're just too swoft.
Swoft. It's one of your crossword answers. I believe it means lying manipulator who tells men anything they want to hear. You brought a prop as a conversation starter. Folded the paper to make it look read, filled in some answers, but you couldn't be bothered to work at it, so you just put in random letters. You have some natural talent as a liar, but not enough brains to see it through. I'm gonna assume you're not a cop. [leans back in his chair] Are the five minutes up?
Coagulopathy plus kidney equals what?
Normal creatinine levels.
[shouting as Wilson walks past] Hey, Wilson! Can't find my pornos.
I assume you moved them while you were dusting. I checked the drawers, windowsill, DVD player in your room. [leans back into the office, stage whisper to the team] The quiet ones are always deeply repressed.
[following him] What? Why did you return them to the store?
I'm not thanking you. I'm asking you why.
You do realize things don't have to be socks to go into a sock drawer.
You completely ruined my morning. I had to pull out your old family photos. [Wilson turns back to look at him.] Your mom was pretty hot. [back in the office] Haff disease fits the timing best. Start her on saline and Mannitol.
Nope.
Too many. Be like doing a whole body scan. Send us up eight blind alleys. That's why Chase is doing it.
She's never met me.
He was a fraud. She couldn't have gone with Keyser Soze? Speaking of movies that don't make any sense, I stopped at the rental store to get those pornos back. I told the guy at the counter I was so grateful that you'd returned them, but I wanted them. Guess what. You only returned two. You lost the third. It's decent of you to pay for it, not let them put it on my bill.
I'm sure you could. But rather than listen to your lies, I thought it'd be more fun to drive all over town and get another copy. [smiles smugly]
Are you hyperventilating? Remember that covering your mouth and one nostril can help.
He's not a director. He's an artist. The way he plays with light and darkness and… [Young Wilson puts his arm around the girl] boobs.
Be not afraid, Wilson. You took risks for your art.
From this moment on, my lips are sealed.
[looking at the Echo] Her mitral valve is nearly gone. Which means she's nearly gone. [looks at Chase] God, you're pretty.
Book club. Oprah was going on and on... [He grabs an almost empty half-gallon of milk from the refrigerator.]
Patient wrote it. [He smells the milk.]
[finally serious.] It's an assignment from my therapist.
I'm all right. Trust me.
I said, "trust me."
Do you mind? I haven't finished it yet. [He takes the book and heads down the hall.]
Read chapter six, entitled "shut the hell up."
Chapter two, "bite me."
Where'd you get all these copies? It's out of print.
You called him? What'd you say?
Did you mention me?
Sure. Give up. Let her die on schedule.
Why was she sleeping? Who can sleep in a hospital during the daytime?
Is that what her blog says? She's a night owl?
In what tense? Is? Was? Will have been?
[checking the blog on Cuddy’s computer] Look at the time stamp on this post. 2:30 A.M. Here's one at 4:00 A.M.
Six months ago, she's posting in the daytime. Two years ago, daytime. That's her natural rhythm.
Which doesn't fit lymphoma.
We know she has the cell atypia that indicates lymphoma. Biopsy her liver. [The team leaves. House turns to Cuddy.] That was pretty cool what I did, right? You wanna make out?
Okay. So we add fever to cell atypia, coagulopathy, kidney, heart, liver...
There has to be something unique to this infection. Something about its transmission and the way it manifests. There has to be something she's not telling us.
Start her on broad-spectrum antibiotics. [They gape at him, unbelieving.] Since we know everything, we might as well treat for everything.
If you're gonna be this way, I'm not gonna invite you to my baptism.
Natural selection is not an infallible force.
"Hi, it's Greg. You slept with my mother."
I was mildly curious. Enough to read a book, not enough to make a phone call.
[As Wilson talks, House has his epiphany.] Crap. [He gets up and heads to the door.]
Do you poop? [Frankie looks at Thirteen who looks at House.] Come on. Everybody poops. I read the book in medical school. Sinkers or floaters?
Greasy and soft or hard and pellet-like?
You just had to be so swoft. You're a hypocrite. No lies, no secrets, but everything stops at your colon. 4,000 pages, not one word about BMs. And I bet yours don't smell at all.
Readers don't. People who don't really care about you don't. But doctors might. The icky stuff changed, right, a few months ago?
A lot of people misunderstand how a vegetarian diet works. You take in less unusable material, and your waste gets more efficient. Harder and rounder. Just look at the feces of rabbits. Seriously. I think I might have some… [He starts to look in his pocket.]
A G.I. Infection causes malabsorption, granulomatous buildup of cells. It's not contagious since no one around her got sick –
[looking from one to the other] Let's split the credit. Start her on co-trimoxazole. [to Frankie] We all need some secrets. As long as they don't kill us, they keep us safe and warm.
Can you write a book? So I can stop talking to you?
'Cause I'm fascinated with how ministers think.
The power to transform into any water-based object?
Underneath the God stuff... More God stuff.
 Get a table, and I won't eat it on the couch.
 But I won't have a good excuse.
 Not my condo.
 Then it would be a reflection of me, not you.  That wouldn't be right.
 (pausing) You've never furnished a home.
 No, you've married a bunch of women, who furnished a bunch of homes.
 You're afraid.
 You are what you sit in.  Your friends, your job, your furnishings — it all defines you.
 Buy some furniture, or admit that you're empty inside.
 And there's no sign of trauma.
 Because if there was, Cuddy wouldn't have needed me to take the case.
 Foreman's the only one with the balls to take a case without checking with me, and he's still working on breakfast.  Which means that the... (He takes up the patient file and puts it on his forehead as if he has the power of telepathy) 18... no, 17-year-old honor student —
 So either you think that smart women look out for each other, which means you're an idiot, or you think Cuddy's not smart, which means... well, I guess it's the same both ways.
 Picture fell out of the file.  She looks smart.  Where's Taub?
 Yeah, he's at home in a fight with his wife.  I'm just curious what he wanted me to know.
 (reading the file) Certainly not if you're an Aussie.  But when an American schoolgirl has two drinks before 10:00 am, it's a pretty sure bet that the plan is to have a lot more.  Probably wasn't the first time she had that plan.
 Someone call Taub.  Tell him to cut the ball and chain on his own time.
 You think she's been eating your wife's cooking?  Hey, I'm on your side, man.
 Don't need to.  Face tells me you're bluffing. (Taub looks at him questioningly)  Not yours — Chase's.
 So come up with a better idea or have a crash cart ready.
 And by "we" you mean "you."
 It's not my fault.  I was busy trying to judge Taub.
 Meaning?
 It's not syphilis. VDRL and enzyme immunoassays were negative.
 While she's on anticoagulants from the aortic surgery?
 Wouldn't cause the edema or dissection.
 Would you care to be a little more specific?
 We hate full-body scans.
 Do the scan.
 I think you work quickly.
 Nope.  It's not “bad” at all.
 If there was any sign of inflammation of the aorta, that would make sense.
 Trust me.  This is gonna help.
 (to Taub) Your texting does not prove you're faithful.  It just proves you know she thinks you're unfaithful.  Can't force trust.  (turning back to the case) What did she hallucinate?
 Not usually.
 We know nothing, brain knows all.  You get an ulcer, you don't know it, but the brain increases mucin secretions.  It knows what the problem is, knows where the problem is.
 Her subconscious is trying to tell her something.  We need to eavesdrop.
 We need the whole story.  The cognitive pattern recognition program might tell us what's going on in her head.
 Fine.  Do the MRA.  When it comes back negative, we can move on to the...  crazy but possible ideas.  (the team leaves)
 I returned it.
 But you didn't buy it.   You rented it.  You made one phone call to (reading from a business ad) Economy Furniture Supply — "we get it done so you don't have to."
 But no clue what any of it meant.
 Perfect.  Another woman to tell you who you are.
 Step inside one furniture store and find one thing you like.
 One.
 And the MRA?
 As predicted.  What did we say we'd move on to?
 Which just leaves us with the question of, what happened during the out-of-body experience?
 Sure.  If you then went on to answer the following —  Did she float above her body?  Did she see Jesus?  Did she bathe in the Ganges?
 No.
 Coincidentally, she could also have a stroke if we do nothing.
 It's not magical.  It's experimental.  Just like washing your hands after pooping once was.  And technically, it's not our best shot.  I'm pretty sure it's our only shot.
 Perfect.  So, Foreman, go get her consent.  The rest of you go down to the cog sci lab.  Equipment should already be there.
 Inspiration point doesn't open till after dark.  Got a real cool magic show about to start.  Also, I'm gonna need to check your spare.
 Anyone ever tell you you can be a real buzzkill?
 It's the sky.  She's thinking about the moon and the stars and the sky.
 Who's that?
 What did daddy die of?
 She likes school, and she has daddy issues — Neither of which helps us.
 (still examining the model of the brain) Not the aortic dissection.
 So that's one imperfect theory, plus a rare complication of a second theory, which gives us a complete explanation.  Don't polish the notion, Foreman.
 Get a better look at her pineal gland with three tesla fast spin echo MRI.  (The team leaves to do the test)
 Which we would expect to see if there was an allergic reaction happening.
 (angry because they have reached a dead end) How exactly do you want to be shot down?  On the basis of the fact that she's never been within 6,000 miles of the Middle East, or on the basis of the fact that all our scans and urine samples came back clean?  (sighing) And yet she’s still failing, system after system.  (sighing again) So, either we find the answer at autopsy or...
 I got nothin'.
 Are you having an affair?  Does it bother you that your wife doesn't have the guts to actually ask that question, and I do?
 Difference is, I'm not afraid of the answer.  And I might believe you.
 But you want to.
 Why?  What, you finally got to the point where half your age plus seven just isn't young enough?
 Or is it because you now really are old enough to be their — (He pauses as the answer suddenly comes to him)  The dad.  Does he travel for work?
 Not hers, her boyfriend's.  He's the one in her visions.
 I'm your son's girlfriend's doctor.
  It's a mouthful, but probably not as tricky as your title.
 Do you travel a lot?
 Where'd you go?
 I think you exposed her to a parasite.
 Because she doesn't have any.
 It's cool.  My theory is that her body was able to kill off the parasite, but what it couldn't do was get rid of the shell, which doesn't show up on the scans.  That little piece of microscopic garbage set off an allergic reaction called cerebellar schistosomiasis delayed hypersensitivity allergy, or cusdehaaa.  Risky, unpleasant treatment, but completely curable.
 You'd think so, wouldn't you?  Only thing is, did you ever have sex with your son's girlfriend?
 Shut up!  See, I can't treat this unless I can confirm it, and the only way she could have been exposed to this parasite is sexually, which means she's gonna die very soon unless you admit that you slept with her.
 (walking around behind Artie so that he is now facing his son) Gee, this is bad, because you now have to choose between her living and the truth becoming public.  And frankly, given what the truth is, it's a tough call.
 (to Nick) Your girlfriend is not allergic to your semen.  She's allergic to the Egyptian parasite swimming around in your dad's semen.
 No need to explain.  Technically, she was legal.
 Hey...  All things considered, it's actually great news.
 You wussed out, and used a decorator.
 'cause it's not.
 You have to.  You can't keep letting other people define you.
 Not another elephant.
 Decorator didn't pick this.
(turning to look at Wilson) I like what this says about you, Wilson.
 What'd you tell him?
 And he bought it?
 Your wife say yes?
 Monkey see, monkey do.  At least he has the young and stupid excuse.
 (sincerely) Good for you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, gotta clear the —
You're on two milligrams of morphine an hour. How the hell are you still awake? No, don't tell me. [He takes the chart from the foot of the bed and glances at it.] Ischemic cardiomyopathy. If the blood's not reaching your gut, you have intestinal hypoperfusion. That'd be stronger than the narcotics.
She was being kind.
Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date.
Yeah, well, you should have kept reading. Heart disease is kind of below my pay grade.
You talking with your mouth full? A little.
I take maybe 1 in 20 cases. A lot of the people I turn down end up dying. It's really a good argument for there being more than one me when you think about it.
No cards, no flowers, not even a phone call. Let me guess. Lighthouse keeper.
So your closest colleagues died 2,000 years ago. That must be it. Not that you have no friends because, say, you're a miserable bastard.
The next few hours are gonna be grim. There'll be nausea, pain, no company, as soon as I can get myself out of here. I can unlock the regulator. You can put yourself in a narcotic haze, sleep blissfully to the end.
Win-win.
Are you trying to guilt me for not taking your case?
You think Odysseus would lie whimpering like a loser in a hospital bed? [getting up and approaching Nash] Come on, take my offer. Take the drug holiday. Numb yourself out.
Bad pain month.
I was in rehab. I had a little problem with the something of my own. Now all I take is ibuprofen, and it's two flights up.
The pain's migrated. I think the arterial wall is damaged.
I haven't had an arteriogram yet.
Interesting... That you jump from physical pain to long-lost love. You're projecting. So what's her name?
What does it matter to you? It's "t" minus four hours. [Nash looks at him. House checks his watch.] 8:20. Now tell me who she is and what are the pathetically long odds that she's gonna visit or call. And why that's a reason not to take the morphine.
So this is what it comes down to in the final hours. Deifying some lost love. Hoping to get her on the phone and make everything perfect. It's pathetic. Either you left her for a reason or she left you for a reason. [He turns and walks toward Nash. He’s holding the emesis basin that he was washing.] A phone call is not —
So why isn't she here?
For sex or love?
And what time it is matters because?
Same thing. Pretty much.
I like being alone. At least I convince myself that I'm better off that way. And then I met someone… at a psychiatric hospital, of all places. She changed me. And then she left. We're better off alone. We suffer alone. We die alone. Doesn't matter if you're a model husband or father of the year. Tomorrow will be the same for you.
It's 9:00.
You don't seem that surprised. [Nash looks away from him.] That's what you expected to get. You waited until you knew she'd be out.
None. Just means you're a hypocrite. 'Cause apparently you do. [He picks up the phone, hits “redial” and hands Nash the phone.] Forget about rights. Just tell her what you need to tell her.
Yeah. I know. [to Nash] I'm sorry I didn't take your case.
 You're new.
 (looking down at himself) And, for the record, a little bit cold.
 (holding up a cereal box) Without breakfast?
 (holding out his hand) House.  Nice to meet you.
 (setting the box on the counter and putting on the apron) So you and Wilson...
 Sorry, must have missed the "if this trailer be a-rockin'" sign out front.
 (entering the room) Huzzah, my loyal peasants!
 (holding the sword up in front of him) Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl at the Goldstein bris.  (He starts swinging and twirling the sword) While I'm busy, you all can check out the Knight down in the E.R., who, instead of seizing the throne, just seized.
 Doesn't work there, he lives there as part of a wonderful little troupe, who spend their weekends reenacting a nobler age, when people crapped in the streets, and Thirteen would have been a grandmother.
 Try doing that with a pen.
 Better idea, why don't you give me something I can use so I won't feel the need to?
 You're forgetting to demonize.
 No.  Two demon eyes.  Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.
 Which is why we need to check out Middle-earth.  Foreman, take Frodo and break bread with the Hobbits.
 (to Taub) That's why you and Chase are gonna get an MRI.
 I said Frodo, not Gollum.
 Who's the chick, and why are you hiding her?
 (putting down the sword and closing the door) And this morning.  I bumped into your babe, naked.
 I was in the kitchen.
 I was naked.
 Uh, it's not important right now.  What is, is why you didn't want me to meet her in the first place.  Is she married?
 A patient?
 She used to be a man.
 She wants to be a man.  Sam — it's a man's name, short for...
 Samantha.  The soulless harpy you were married to before we met.
 (lowering the sword) Sure.  They get older, ovaries start drying up, and nice guys like you look attractive again.
 By this, you mean a sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach.  Fine.  I get it.  It's your life.  (He opens the door for Wilson) You go screw it up.  I can wait.
 To tell you, "I told you so."
 Fun stuff never is.
 Except it's not food poisoning.  If it was, the E.R. would look like Camelot right now.
 No one else was sick, because they weren't allergic like he was.
 That's what I sent you to Middle-earth to find out. (House tosses the cow eye to Foreman) Run scratch tests for the samples you brought back.
 (testily) So treat him with epinephrine too.
 (sitting on the nurse’s station counter and rubbing his leg) Unless he's allergic and allergic to the cure.  Sodium bisulfite — the preservative that keeps epi peppy — can cause tachycardia.
 Lord have MRSA.
 I'm sure you'll be fine. (pointing to Taub and Chase) You two get a sample to the lab to confirm, (to Thirteen) you get the Knight into isolation and on I.V. antibiotics.  (to Foreman) You... stay away from me.   (He leaves quickly)
 Need to talk.
 (sitting in a chair in front of the desk) MRSA, shmrsa.  Something important.
 Wilson.
 I don't believe it.
 No, that he's actually capable of keeping a secret from me.
 (chuckling and leaning forward in the chair) Would I?  Like — like how you slept with your father's best friend or...
 You need to break them up.
 So you'd rather sit back and watch while the evil blonde gorges on Wilson's tender flesh and then tosses out his bones like she did the last time?  You remember what he was like after that?
 Well, then do something.  (leaning back in the chair) God knows he's not gonna listen to me.  You, on the other hand, have decades of experience dating and being attracted to losers.  Obviously, I don't include myself.
 Of course.  I do it all the time.  Hmm, I see your point.
 (coming into the lab) Hope they bought you dinner first.
 I know, it's poison Ivy.
 They have bonfires every night.  The burning leaves aerosolizes the oil.  We've seen what it's done to the outside of his body.  Imagine what it's doing to his lungs and his sinuses.
 How about this?  Apparently, it's all over his sword.
 Which is true of anything that would compromise his immune system, which means it has to be some other environmental toxin.  Yesterday he was a healthy Knight, today he's Sleeping Beauty.  Nothing else fits.
 Then he ate the poison apple somewhere else.  Or maybe you just missed it.  Start treatment for trichinosis and confirm with a muscle biopsy.  (He leaves)
 Told you so.
 Damn it.  I never should have let her see me naked.
 Why?
 You were.
 So you're asking me to condone a relationship based on lies and mistrust.
 When and where?
 What am I gonna wear?  All my cereal boxes are at the cleaners.
 How could I say no?  (He smiles and heads for the exit)
 Sorry we're late.  But you know girls.  Always fiddling with the hair and the makeup.  James, Sam.... this is Sarah.
 (correcting her) House.
 (sarcastically) Yeah, delightful.
 Which one of you checked out the apartment?
 His symptoms fit an environmental—
 Search the apartment.
 (interrupting, and shouting at them as he walks away) Go!  Now!
 (holding up the toy soldier) Plumbum nigrum.
 Our Knight/Warlock apparently also dabbles in alchemy.
 Biopsy the cysts, and you'll find your lead.
 Wouldn't need a team if I did all the work, now, would I?  Plus, I had to make you dinner.
 I bet your plans don't taste like this.
 I'm trying to be nice.  What I did the other night was juvenile.  I'm sorry.
(He pours more wine for each of them)  It's my mom's recipe.  Everything else, I got off the Web.
 Where I found the lamb ragout, and you two found each other...  Again.
 And here we are.
 I think you're old enough, now.  But if you would like me to come along with you...
 Yeah, James, I cook in peace.
 You're a cold-hearted bitch, who ripped his heart out.  I watched him struggle for years to overcome the damage you did.  And there's no way I'm going to just let you reel him back in so you can do it all over again.
 Phase two of getting to know my enemy.
 Same here.  Only difference is, I'll outlast you.
 End scene.
 Absolutely.
 There's only one thing left to do.
 Actually, I've already gotten good value.
 No, you told me that you couldn't find anything here that could be causing the symptoms.
 Do you think he's making a mistake?
 Wilson's not like us.  He cares too much about people and their feelings.
 The code that our Knight claims to live by, all that crap about honor and chivalry.  Wilson's naturally like that, which is why he's—
 A sucker and a target.  So we gotta look out for him.  Do you smell that?
 (picking a bottle off a shelf) You know what this is?
 Try rose hips.  (He puts it back)
 It could be cyanide as far as he knows.  (He picks up another bottle) How about this?
 Wrong again.  Black cohash.
 (holding up a tuberous plant) You know what this is?
 It's hemlock, you embossed carbuncle.
 Did you sell it to anyone?
 You sold it to Sir William?
 (He looks at Thirteen) It's the only part of the environment you didn't check.  The people living in it.
 Because you poisoned him.  Your royal anus.  (He holds up the hemlock) With this.
 Hemlock.  I need to know how much you used and how you prepared it.
 The apothecary's willing to testify that you're the only one he gave it to.
 If it was for the challenge, then why is wee Willie the only Knight who's dying?
 Well, the good news is we now know what's wrong with you.  The bad news is that your King's precious ideals were just pretend after all.  At least, when it comes to guys who get too close to his Queen.
 I guess you've never heard the expression, "gas chromatography machines don't lie."
 Miles is a jealous idiot.  And you're just an idiot.
 Well, it's been in his system two days.  We're lucky he's lasted this long.
 It was just sitting in a stone.
 Anything good?  And by good, I, of course, mean bad.
 (getting up from the chair) Well, there's gotta be something I can use.
 But stealing them did.
 Careful.  I have a sword.
 I'm sorry, is that the statutory period for soul sucking?
 So prove it.  And dump him... again.
 Sorry, go on.  And, yes.
 We did it.  Well, I did it.
 These aren't focal hepatic lesions on his liver, they're peliosis hepatis lesions.  Which in combination with an erratic heart rate, usually indicates—
 Two major symptoms of anabolic steroid abuse.
 Our patient's a juicer.  Ancient poison accelerated the damage of the modern poison.  Start treatment; let the King out of the tower.
He's just trying to get into your skirts. And I don't mean metaphorically.
Have a nice day.
I said I'd stay out of it. (He gives Wilson a look).
Nothing.
Nope.
Okay, I may have seen something in the fridge. Like the end of your relationship. (Nodding to the fridge) She put the milk in the door and not on the shelf.
You hate that she did that, but you didn't say anything. (Wilson laughs)
No, I'm trying to help. If you got an issue, let her know.
Fine. Stew in your irritation. And sure, last time it bubbled over into resentment and rage, leading ultimately to a painful divorce that neither of you ever really recovered from, but I'm sure this time it'll be great.
Says the guy whose opposable thumbs have been all over how many women who aren't his wife?
Boring. Then we have to find a reason to rule it out.
But it would show up on a barium enema. (He drops the file on the table and grabs his cane)
Barium coats the inner lining of your colon. Lets us get a good look at it on the X-ray.
Okay, roll onto your side. It's fill 'er up time. So is Evelyn his new squeeze?
Must be interesting growing up in a production of Oh! Calcutta!
You can explain that she's the reason the two of you stayed married.
But you just don't want to be young together.
Tank's full. I'll page the radiology elves.
Absolutely. There's no need to find any underlying cause 'cause these things never happen twice. Take her digestive system for a test drive. Give her a radio-opaque milkshake. X-ray every 15 minutes to see if it makes any unscheduled stops on the way through.
No, Taub will be here all night. Talk to the unicorn and then tell me you don't believe. (He puts his glasses on and grabs something to read).
That's not the lie. The lie is that he gives a crap about how his wife feels. If they're both screwing around, that's one thing. But if she has a piece on the side and he doesn't, the only way he'd be okay with that is if he's betraying her in some other way that, in his mind, makes them even. My unicorn isn't a unicorn. It's a donkey with a plunger stuck to its face. (He looks sad, somehow.)
What I believe is that men are genetically engineered to be jealous. Doesn't matter if I think there's a score. I guarantee you he does. Any of the wife's partners pan out?
So we're back to the husband.
He's doing something behind her back. What better cover than a business trip to Nebraska? Like that's really a place.
And he nicked himself shaving. Sorry. That was Taub. But it was easier to solve. Means he used the crappy razor in his locker, which means he slept here.
On the medical front, we've knocked out sex and foreign travel. Could be an electrolyte imbalance.
Figured it would either blow up your marriage or make it more honest. Either way, you win.
Just because everybody in this room wishes that all women were horny all the time doesn't make it so. (Chase looks amused.) Get an MRI of her adrenal glands.
Clotting disorder would explain everything. (We hear the office door opening.) Question is, which one?
Only the ones labeled, "n-s-f-w."
Sorry, that's "n-n-s-f-w."
Oh, I'm long past the number of procedures that'll bankrupt them.
By "we," she means "she." (Thirteen sighs and stays).
Wilson's been teaching me how to care. Try me.
You're right. I don't care. (Heavy rubber band shaking). Clotting disorder: DIC. Factor five leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome.
Go test our patient's blood…
… for everything we discussed. (Thirteen leaves. House turns to Wilson.) I'm sorry.
As long as you're free, you want to grab some dinner? (Wilson looks like he wants to strangle House, but leaves anyway.)
Which means we need to come up with a better idea. So what causes problems in the stomach, heart, nerves? (Taub is waving pages of the file, looking somewhat smug. House stops, takes a deep breath, gets his trademark epiphany look).
Oh, my God.
Thank God someone's keeping us focused on what's really important. (He sits next to Taub and watches him closely.)
Imaging showed normal diameter in her pulmonary artery. Here's a thought — (They all pay attention.) Taub's wife is now totally on the market. Mind hitting me with her digits?
Pain, pain went away, came back another day. Question is, what brought it back?
Yeah, he's right. Let's get this wrapped up before 6. Taub turns back into a faithful pumpkin at midnight.
PNS also controls digestion, which she's been doing without screaming her head off since she's been here.
Foam?
Nothing. That's the beauty. I genuinely tried to help Wilson. I told him to stand up for himself, which you know is legitimate advice. And his relationship blew up.
If this should somehow lead to Lucas dying or oral sex, so be it. (Cuddy looks somewhat entertained.)
Actually, IBD does make sense, 'cause it could trigger ankylosing spondylitis, which would explain the heart and the kidneys. Start her on sulfasalazine and TNF inhibitors. (They follow him in the corridor. House enters the elevator.) Oh, and Taub, I'm not gonna see you before you head off for Gomorrah. Just remember, if you get disoriented… breathe through your nose and look for the horizon.
Why the lack of afterglow? Physio girl not as freaky as you'd hoped?
Seriously, you'd think it'd kill her if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?
I don't care what it's not. I want to know what it could be.
Good. Treat for those three.
Glad the husband's back. After missing so many little deaths, he should be here for the big one. Top six, anyone?
We'd have seen some improvement on prednisone. (Looking at flowers in the room.) Guy's wife's dying, and he stops to buy flowers.
Those are lilacs. My mom used to grow lilacs. My dad made her get rid of them, 'cause there were too many bees. We ruled out HSP 'cause there was no inciting respiratory infection. But in rare cases, it can also be triggered by a bee sting.
Maybe we just didn't see it.
Have you been stung by a bee recently?
Not that you know of. Okay, I'm gonna have to check your holes. I'll start with the mouth. If there's nothing there, then things might have to get kinky. Say aah. (He gets a light.)
I was kinda hoping for kinky.
That is adorable. Other than you still wanting to have sex with other dudes, and him bankrupting your family, I think you kids are pretty much home free.
You two made up?
You can thank me later.
 I met the neighbors.
 Good morning.
 (checking his own message slips) That's nothing.  I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.
 (looking at Jeffrey over the top of his sunglasses) That’s not what your mama said.  (snapping his fingers in the air)  Oh! Snap.
 He started it.  It was the neighbor's kid's bed.  Luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy.
 About yea drunk.
 You sound just like Esteban's mom.
 Sorry, I'm busy.
 (to Chase) Tell me you have a case.  You know, even if you don't.
 Sounds interesting.  I'll take it.  (They walk away from Cuddy)  I owe you one.  Now tell me you don't have a case.
 We're even.
 You guys know how to honeymoon.  (He tosses his cane and then his backpack to Chase)
 "Aphasia" is Greek for loss of voice.
 (looking at Nicole) A lot of guys syncope at the altar.  It's Greek for "having the vapors."
 Don't say "ah."
 (tossing the tongue depressor in the trash) Roll on your side and lift up your gown.
 There's one thing they didn't test for.
 Faking.
 Test was positive.
 Hey, I'm not the one you have to convince.
 Well, if she's buying that, she might just be a keeper.
 Well, the—  (House pretends to faint and collapses onto Ted’s bed)
 Is she buying this too?
 (getting up off the bed) Kryo podia.  It's Greek for "duh."  (taking his cane and backpack from Chase)  Still, you get to keep the engagement ring.
 That's because you're more gullible than I am.  (they stop at the elevator) For instance, I don't believe that you called off your open marriage.  I believe your wife called it off, and you called off telling her that you weren't calling it off.  A guy doesn't just throw a golden ticket in the trash.
 That's exactly why you dabble.  You're compensating for your professional conquests with sexual ones.
 No, thanks.
 I did, just very quickly.
 Okay.  If you bring your wife.
 You're lying.
 Then I'm not going.
 There's gotta be a better way to call off a wedding.  A Tweet, for example.
 (turning around to look at the team) Okay, let's say all his symptoms are real.  Explain how one of them suddenly went away without using the words "virgin" or "Mary."
 A medication he's not telling us about.
 I don't even trust the ER.  Let's rule out infections ourselves.  Tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure.
 This time, talk about nuptials while you do it.  Check his home for everything else.
 (to Foreman) You check his love nest.  (to Taub and Thirteen) You two check his swinging bachelor pad.
 I assume so.
 Really?  'Cause it would certainly explain the cold feet.  Oh, and the boyfriend.
 Well, it's possible.  It doesn't mean you're gay just 'cause the guy you're sleeping with is.
 So we got to wondering, how does a 27-year-old get mono?  You're a little old for the kissing disease, unless your immune system is compromised.
 Okay.  I'll go test your fiancee for HIV.  Is she the curious sort?
 Sodomy, one of the top ten most common household accidents.
 To zap the fabulous right out of him.
 Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's he-man quackery camp.  Run an EEG.  See if they straightened him or just scrambled him.
 No need.  I already texted her.  And here she is now.
 (leaning in close) I think you're still seeing the physio.  (Taub turns back to House) You've got a backup suit in your car.  Don't want to be bringing home da stank.
 Hi, Rachel.
 (looking very pleased with himself) I'm just leaving.  I've got a ceramics class.
 I love it.  Even managed to talk Chris into signing up for one.  Of course, he's in the beginners' class.
 Friday nights, right?
 You should join Chris'.
 Well, gotta go.  Making a tea service.  (He pats Taub on the shoulder as he leaves)
 Four ways to stop a heart.  (He walks toward Taub) Electrical problems, restricted blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be, shocks, blocks, or bleeds.
 (looking at Taub) And cheating.  (he guffaws) Oh, no. Sorry.  That's how you break a heart.
 Now you just have to find some pottery by Taub.  The lamer it looks, the better.
 You should be a doctor.
 Your life is awesome.
 No, you weren't.
 Because if you were, you'd need to see the pain in her eyes so she could see the concern in yours.  Why are you setting me up on dates with my team?  (Wilson shakes his head)  Taub asking me out was quirky, but Thirteen doing it is a barking cat.
 By setting me up with a hottie that I can't sleep with?  And Thirteen?
 I don't need your help.
 I gave him a dollar.  How much did you have to pay?
 Racking you with guilt.  So I do something really stupid and you reward me.  Read any parenting manual.  That's not helping me.  That's helping you.
 Okay.
 For you.
 It's not gonna work, though.
 P.O.T.S. - Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  BP plummets when he's upright, reverts to normal when he's lying down.
 So load him up with fludrocortisone.
 (to Taub) You didn't read your ceramics course description, did you?
 As I'm sure your wife did.  So we all know they're doing a fourth of July theme.  She'll be expecting something star-spangled.
 So do I.  Should I call or raise with a double gutshot draw?
 No.  What about infection?
 I was talking about you.  Has the little gent been wearing a tent?
 A distracted person makes a distracted professional.
 Probably.  Do a spinal tap.  Run the CSF.  (Taub starts to leave) Still talking about you.  (Taub stops and turns back to House) But you can do it on the patient, too, if you want.  (Taub leaves)
 (nodding) What about her?
 She's the only one who's not here for fun.
 If your gaydar is so great, how come you didn't know about the patient till you met his boyfriend?
 You don't think he loves her?
 Taub loves his wife, but he needs to have sex with other women.
 (finishing her sentence) to resist a biological imperative.
 Says someone who's obviously never been on a diet.
 You're successful, smart, and you attract everything that moves.  If you want to focus on the fact that you're not gonna see 50, that's your choice.
 (answering the phone) Yeah?
 We were just talking about you.
 (into the phone) Not quite.  You did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse.
 He sprung a leak.  He's losing CSF from the tap site.
 Just you, actually.
 The low pressure in his brain caused the P.O.T.S., not the other way around.  Patch the leak and top him up with artificial CSF. (He closes his phone)
 So what's masquerading as a stroke?  Voted the worst Halloween costume, by the way.
 Chest x-rays showed no hilar masses.  (to Taub) Any luck with the pottery?
 Skin's fine.  A.N.A. was negative.  So what did that set you back?
 EIA was clear.  Hey, could have gone a lot higher than $215.
 NILLAS.  No.  Idiot.  Lactate.  Levels.  Are.  Stable.  We're missing something.
 If history is written by the victor, how do we find out what really happened?
 Call the boyfriend.  Let's get them all in the same room.
 Or we could get them all in the same room and get the truth.
 Can't.  Pap smear.
 It's gonna suck.
 Where and when?
 The night just keeps getting better.
 To Wilson.
 If he can't tell his fiancee he's gay, how is he gonna tell her he's pregnant?
 Nope.  TSH was normal.
 Check his prolactin level, then MRI his pituitary.
 You believe Chase?
 I realized that they could be my friends.
 And then I sobered up.
 I think I sleep better in rocket ship sheets.
 And wisdom is knowing the difference between what you can change... (House pauses and reaches for his cane.  This is the medical epiphany moment)  And what you were born with.
 (finishing Taub’s sentence) was normal.
 How are the headaches?
 Give me your head.
 I know.  It's the first time you've heard that sentence with a possessive pronoun.
 How cool is that?  You have a Chiari malformation, a narrowing in the base of your skull that can cut off CSF flow.  But it wasn't a problem until the ECT at breeder boot camp caused your brain to swell just enough to plug the opening.  And when your brain pressed up against your pituitary, it signed you up for La Leche League.  You still won't be pitching a tent for your lady, but that's just because, you know, she's a lady.
 It also does an uncanny Christopher Walken.  Unfortunately, if you treat it like P.O.T.S., it gets worse.  So, as far as that goes, oops.
 Overbearing mother.  Kidding.  CM's congenital.  Like so many other things, you were born that way.
 It's Friday night.
 Frees you up for the next one.
 (taking the box) For trying to wreck your marriage?
 And I get napkin rings?
 Good work.
 He doesn't have a home.
 So Wilson got to you too?
 Lucas?
 I'm not that hungry.
 (very seriously) Funny.  That's the last thing I want us to be.
Okay. "Therafy" me.
You're fat.
You know how far the parking lot is? My leg's been hurting.
No. Probably just gonna rain. [He grips his right thigh and looks off to his right, avoiding Nolan’s gaze.]
I was late. I wasn't focusing on the decor, but it sounds appropriately bland and calming.
I'm not stressed… Beyond the stress induced by you telling me how stressed I am.
I had a patient.
[removing his sunglasses] Beer?
We know she has money. [He picks up a sneaker.] Blaze Outriggers — 400 bucks a pair. People who have money don't just disappear. Sooner or later, someone's gonna show up looking for her.
You don't eat because you remember it's time to eat. You eat 'cause you're hungry. [He pulls the blanket off her legs and feels her calves.] Her metabolism is in high gear. She is an extreme long-distance runner—
[still looking at the patient] That's your question? [back in Nolan’s office, Nolan nods] You're a psychotherapist. You're hearing about a great amnesia case, and all you're asking me is geography.
[defiant for a moment, then he drops his eyes] I was avoiding Wilson. It's not something you couldn't have seen eight miles away.
[voice over] Wilson's a processor. I knew there were some things that he'd want to process with me… at length.
If it's before Friday, your assistant wins the pool. [He takes a bite of his muffin.]
Tonight?
But she wants me to move out.
By moving too quickly. Given your usual rate of commitment, I'm surprised you're not already re-divorced.
What's wrong with my old place?
[nodding] Where I didn't abuse drugs and hallucinate.
I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?
He couldn't foresee Sam coming back into his life.
Based on what?
Those aren't symptoms.
Case was interesting.
[slight smile] Or not.
Here. Loss of differentiation between gray and white matter. [He points to an area on the scan.]
Fine. I'll give you the Cliff Notes version. Chase – MS, Taub – physical trauma. I can tell you why we ruled them out.
Her heart rate monitor has a serial number. The distributor can match the number to the store that sold it. She's a serious athlete. She might have been there often enough to be remembered.
Subtextually.
Even if the store clerk doesn't know who she is, the store's probably close to where she lives. Just seeing those surroundings might spark a memory.
No. I'll take her.
Patients are boring… As people. This one I'm sure was no exception, but her situation was interesting. Besides, I was still avoiding Wilson. And no better way to avoid than leaving the hospital.
I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home…
[voice over] Before I came into work that day. I went straight there from Wilson's.
Not exactly.
Why are you here?
Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson. Why are you here?
And turn his apartment into a giant prison jumpsuit.
My stuff?
Coffee table — where'd you put it? In the bedroom?
You sold my table to pay for paint that I don't want?
Get out.
Look, I'm going to work now. And when I come back, the walls will be a less exciting color, and you will be gone. [He drops a duffle bag on the floor with a thud.]
Unlike me, Alvie didn't leave. I took my motorcycle to work that day. When I went home to get my car, he was painting the ceiling magenta. So I brought him with me to protect the apartment.
To protect the apartment. Whoa. Deja vu.
Obviously because he's a Wilson substitute. You can barely tell the difference between them, especially when Wilson raps about the hood.
From what?
Shut up, Alvie. Anything familiar… Church, grocery store?
You know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, right? Instead of working the case, why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?
So get a new one.
There's only one copy?
How'd that go?
Then someone will show up — a spouse, a friend — to tell you who you really are and what you should be feeling. They always do.
What did they say at the hearing?
Your mother is Puerto Rican, therefore, you are Puerto Rican. All you got to do is prove your mom's your mom, find some documentation—
Alvie, the hearing—
We're not here— [voice over] And then I realized… [to Alvie] You make a good point.
Your old friend, the fried carbohydrate. [to the cashier] She needed the calorically dense food to support the running habit. Do you know her name?
Do you know where they live?
Here, work, anywhere she could have been exposed. Why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro on your list?
Do you have any idea what would sound like you?
[voice over] That it was a strange position to be in. At that moment, she was more comfortable with me than with her husband. And he was picking up on it.
What about me how?
Those are my two choices? None of the above. She was just a patient. She was interesting.
Toxic exposure to methane could explain this.
We'll take her back to the hospital, test her blood and urine and start treatment.
What happened?
Urinary incontinence. [He checks Sidney’s eyes.] She's having complex partial seizures. This isn't methane. And you can leave the bucket. We need to get her to—
I'm choosing my diagnoses based on personal issues? You think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?
Chase had the toxin idea. Maybe he's obsessed with my past.
Which is also not a toxin.
Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.
There's a ding mark.
Sure, the–the cup marks and the scuffs and the paint and those three chips. This fourth one’s new.
You said you pawned five books. There's only four.
Where's “Approach to the Acute Abdomen”?
To?
How much for the pile?
[stunned] You said it was junk.
Unlike the rest of humanity… Who's okay when their belongings are taken. Everyone wants their stuff. That's why it's their stuff.
I like my stuff. I hate it when Wilson moves it—
This is not about Wilson! [He slams his fist on the table, causing the carafe and glasses to jump. Nolan tilts his head and looks at House. House sits for a minute then taps on the table, breaking his mood.] Say it.
31, 31! Hike!
One more, you get a touchdown.
Hike!
And… hike!
Because I thought you were a smart guy who didn't need the obvious spelled out to him. Wilson noticed that I didn't come to my office all day. He came to find me, wanted to make sure I'm okay — boring, boring, boring.
You okay?
That's very sad, Alvie. Listen, I set up an immigration hearing.
I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.
Yeah.
Try a strobe light, add more stress.
Seems she had a wake-up call while she was at college. Her brother died in a car accident. She decided to make her life mean something. Went to law school. Now that's all gone.
Yeah. I knew the psychological aspects of this case would interest you. Bet you got a theory already. What is it?
[deliberately] What is it?
I think he just… bores her. She's at an earlier stage of development. She's looking at her grown-up future, and it puts her to sleep.
He almost did lose his wife.
[pointing to the image on the monitor] Hypothalamus here, hence the D.I. and incontinence. The amygdala here, hence the global amnesia. And the motor cortex —that's the foot paralysis. What do they all have in common?
It ends with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis. I convinced the team to cut out part of this woman's brain. That's not interesting to you?
Not even if it's the amygdala? She'll lose all her long-term memory.
[rubbing at his scalp with his fingertips as if he’s washing his hair] Aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?
Are you charging me for this time?
This is ridiculous.
It's just a bruise. And I fell.
No. I was drunk… Hence the balance issues. [He reaches for his jacket.]
I said something that someone objected to.
It's usually the way it is when someone hits me. People who kick when you're down are jerks, but they're generally not irrational jerks.
I don't know.
[puzzled] What?
[thinks, then shakes his head. speaks quietly] I don't know. [long pause] Okay, there may be a problem.
What prompted this?
[grabbing the address] God's sake, Wilson. You really span the chasm from wishy to washy. If you're gonna be an ass, be an ass. Stick with it.
Come on. Cuddy played on his guilt. She put him up to this.
Two reasons — first, he wants to create the perfect environment to be with Sam. He's been thinking about asking me to leave for a while. Finally he does it and immediately turns around and changes his mind? No. He talked to somebody.
[voice over] Yeah, that's a possibility.
Because they've been talking about me. She called me to check on the patient, which she never does without a reason. I asked why, and she said…
Right now the patient's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence.
Touching base. Wilson used exactly the same phrase. Colluding about me is their favorite pastime.
Yeah, he is.
Your version needed to be ended, 'cause it's crap. It's all sweetness and light and… faith that I'm gonna choose the right path. Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.
And I know that he and Cuddy have gone behind my back before to strategize about the House problem.
Wilson is not a consolation prize.
[glowering] He's my friend.
[thinks] I can say whatever I want to him, and he'll never leave.
For now. After the divorce, he'll probably ask me to move in again. I take the long view.
Are you kidding? That's the kind of remark that leads people to hit you.
You say that now that I finally agree with you? Do you just argue the opposite of whatever I say?
[thinking] I told you, I don't know.
Well, yeah. That's why I called it an ordinary week.
Without the surgery, she'll lose everything. The prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain.
Well, you can stop arguing, 'cause it doesn't matter anymore. Look at the variability in the heart rate. The S.E. has spread into the brain stem.
This thing's moving too quickly. Surgery's no longer an option, which I guess means you've won. Congratulations. [to Taub] Put in a pacer and start her on chemo and radiation. It won't cure her, but it'll buy a couple weeks so she can find out who she is before she dies.
Husband was being an idiot.
He'd rather risk his wife's life than their marriage. People's brains stop working when they think they're gonna lose someone they love.
It's all right.
50 bucks for the book.
You paid $25. That's 100% return.
$2,000. I'll write you a check.
Anyone see you?
It's very, very tiny.
Brain, heart, and rapidly progressing.
[voice over] Or allows an old infection to reactivate it — TB. [cut to courtroom] Start her on a multidrug regimen.
Give her the first dose directly into the lungs in the O.R.
Put her in an isolation room with U.V. light. And get yourselves tested. You've all been exposed.
I am Mr. Alvarez's doctor. [He hands her a sheet of paper, which she unfolds and reads.]
It could be.
I'm better at it than you are.
Wait, wait.
There's something on her ankle. [He touches her leg]
She tried to get it removed, but they only took off the top layers of skin. The ink is still in the deeper layers. [cut to Nolan’s office] Set off an allergic reaction. She was fine until she started the long-distance running. The ultra-marathoning modified her immune system, set off the allergic reaction. We did a full thickness skin graft, and she'll be okay.
[voice over] Not yet.
No way to know.
Taub thought it might—
Not exactly.
Alvie?
[putting the note down] Alvie was very grateful that I'd gotten him out of trouble. It allowed him to go stay with his cousin in Phoenix without worrying about immigration looking for him there.
No.
[voice over] Nothing happened next.
That's all I got.
Bergman. [shrugs] What do you want me to say?
They're happy. Why should I screw that up? Everyone's happy. Everyone's moving in together — Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas. Even Alvie's—
They talked about moving in together before. It's not big news.
Her great-grandfather. I've had it for years… Always meant to give it to her for a special occasion.
It's just a gift.
I'm not gonna go out and get hammered because a woman I'm not even with is moving in with someone. That'd be pathetic. To hell with this. When I first came to you, I told you that I wanted to be happy, and I followed your advice. And instead, I'm just miserable. How is this working for me?
For a year, I've done everything you've asked, and everybody else is happy. I run on my treadmill. You just sit there and watch. You're a faith healer. You take advantage of people who want to believe. But there's nothing in your bag of tricks.
Whatever the answer is, you don't have it.
 (looking down and sideways, but not at Cuddy)  Don't care.
 No, it's just a book he wrote.  Open it up.
 It's a big step you're taking.  I wanted to congratulate you.  I understand that's the adult thing to do.
 I've known for a while.  The fact that you decided to cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler.  Unless my intel is wrong.
 Trouble in paradise?
 (shining a light into the eyes of a young woman with blood running down her face) Can you hear me?
 (to Cuddy) That sound like a yes?
 (to the worker recording the decisions of the triage doctors) Skull fracture.  Glasgow coma score of 11.  She's immediate.
 Move on.  This guy's dead.
 (pulling off his latex gloves) Forget the wound.  Look at his toes.  Atherosclerotic emboli.  He'll never survive the surgery.
 It's not the shoes.  Skin shows smoker's facies.  He's not gonna make it till morning.  He'll just take up an ambulance ride, surgeon's time, and an ICU bed.
 (to Jay) Tell me when something hurts.
 Something other than your conscience.  Is that a pill in your pocket, or are you just happy to have a tiny pill-shaped penis?
 Caffeine pills.  You fell asleep taking these?
 Is that normal for you?
 (to Foreman) This much caffeine for a coffee virgin.  There's no way he fell asleep.  He passed out.  Which means a neurological disorder caused the crash, not fatigue.  (yelling to Cuddy) Hey.  We're taking the crane operator back to Princeton.
 (to Foreman) Steal an ambulance.  And call the team.  Tell 'em we got a case.
 Well he needs me there.  And he moans louder than you do.
 Lots!  Every time Cuddy leans over a patient, it's another opportunity for a down blouse nip slip.  What's going on between her and Lucas?
 I gave her the housewarming gift earlier.  And she paused for a split second, like she was hiding something.
 Or maybe she didn't want to accept a gift for something she wasn't gonna do.
 (reaching into the machine and pulling out a drink) Yeah. Vending machine collapsed.
 She still using your ex-wife as a realtor?
 Well, know a little farther, will you?  Look into it.
 Hey!  There's somebody down here!
 (who has acquired a flashlight) I heard something — there's gotta be a void down there.
 There's smashed cars down there.  The gasoline throw off their scent?
 Anybody hear me?  Hey!  Anybody hear me?
 Aah!  Oh...
 (brushing her free of debris) What's your name?
 Well, you should have told me earlier.  I could have picked it up on the way.  What's your name?
 I'm not asking your name because I wanna become friends.  I'm trying to gauge your mental state.
 Okay, that's a start.  What day of the week is it?
 Better still.
 You know that giant construction crane next door?  It's kind of on top of you right now.  Okay, I'm gonna try to pull you out.
 Okay, okay.
 Whew…  I'm gonna need to get help.
 No one knows I'm down here.
 I'll be right back.
 Perfect!  Let's start right now.  Put me on speaker.  (shouting, to be heard over the noise of the saw) What causes syncope?
 Who don't need to be diagnosed.  They just need to be bandaged.  What causes syncope?
 How's he gonna sleep with 50 cups of coffee going through his veins?
 I hear ten, eleven, and twelve.  Where's Thirteen?
 Do you have the answer to my question after that?  Space-occupying lesion in his brain is most likely.  MRI will prove I'm right.
 Which we'd wanna find anyway.  Two birds with one scan.  Do it.
 She getting weaker?  Paler?
 That means her blood loss in minimal.  Buys us some time.  Get the IV into her tibia.  It's almost hollow, feeds into the venous system.  (The EMT stares at him blankly) Which, they obviously don't teach you in EMT school.
 Told ya I'd be back.
 (unzipping the medical kit) Heard you might be thirsty.
 (to the Captain) I assume that bodes well for the rescue?
 You testing my mental state?
 Look, the guy who just left is the one who's gonna be holding your hand through all this.  You talk to him.
 Little pinch.
 Okay.  Big pinch.
 Uh, no bars down here.  L'chaim.
 Don't worry.  Fire marshal Bill will be back soon.
 So I hope I didn't weird you out giving you that gift.
 Of course.  (He pauses briefly) Is now later?  Maybe things aren't going so well with Lucas.  If so, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to step into anything.
 So why the weirdness?
 No wonder you wanna hide this from me...  Since I'm such a delicate flower.
 That might make sense, 'cept you're not wearing the ring.  (The camera cuts back to a closeup shot) So...You are hiding it, which begs the question—
 (Interrupting) We are not cutting off her leg.  (to Hanna) You don't have to rush through this to make his job easier.  (He motions toward the captain)
 So could cheeseburgers.  (to Captain McCreaney) Let's get your lazy friends to start moving that pile.  She's got two more hours before crush syndrome could possibly set in.
 You think chopping off someone's limb inside a pile of dirty rocks is safe?  Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage.
 House.  You don't need to thank me.  It just makes sense.
 (crossing his fingers) I promise.  Does that make you feel better?
 (flipping open his phone) Switched carriers.  Better rollover minutes.  (into the phone) Talk.
 So there was something wrong before the collapse.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah — you don't think he was sick before.  We get it!  You're wrong.
 (to Thirteen) Where were you?
 Good theory.  Except for the part that there's no fever.  Get an X-ray venogram.  See if you can find a reason for your existence.  Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.
 Not if you were too busy not looking for it.
 Just do what I tell you.  Be back in ten minutes.  (He disconnects the call)
 There's a dozen people here who can save you.  I'm apparently the only one who can save this other guy.
 (zipping up his jacket) So calm her down.
 I'm flattered.  Give her oxygen.  (He starts up the bike engine)
 Not at all.  I just realized how...  big and scary the world is and how cozy and safe this little place is.  (He takes off his leather jacket)
 Here.  Call your husband.
 See?  This is why I lied about the phone.  Your BP is spiking, so you're bleeding faster from your leg wound.  I'm gonna have less time to save it.  Hang up.
 That was stupid of me.
 I don't see that as a contradiction.
 What did I tell you about not raising your blood pressure?
 Crane fell on it.  (Hanna laughs)  Small world.
 I'll remember that for my next human contact.
 No.  I'm not in the habit of encouraging my patients' superstitions.
 I don't believe in God.
 I didn't use to.  Then recently I tried...  Now I don't know.
 Yeah.  We'll catch a ball game or...  group sex show or something.
 Okay, now when the beam starts lifting, you're gonna feel pain.  It's gonna be like your foot's gone to sleep times a billion.  You'll notice that I'm waiting till now to tell you.
 That's good.  That means the pressure's coming off.  Much closer to getting out of here.
 Come on.  Pull her out.
 Come on!
 Hanna!  Hanna!  What the hell happened?
 One, two, three—
 Kit.  Gimme the kit.
 No breath sounds on the left side.  Tension pneumothorax.  Okay, Hanna.
 (holding Hanna’s hand for a second) I'm gonna have to go.
 You know who's even luckier?  You and just about every other human being (His cell phone rings) who wasn't down there.
 (answering the phone) What did the venogram say?
 That's 'cause everything's sore.  He just took a 15-story swan dive into concrete.  Do an LP.
 So you're suggesting we do an LP.
 Genius.
 No.
 Crush syndrome is basically a buildup of potassium.  If we remove potassium—
 But not with glucose and Insulin.  We have glucose in the kit.  There's gotta be a diabetic here somewhere.
 (still rubbing his leg) Really?  'Cause I think I'm the only one here who knows what a leg is worth.  And fortunately, you're not the one in charge — he is.  And he knows that I'd testify against him if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg without exhausting every option.
 Really?  (standing up and towering over her) Wow.  So this is all about you now.
 Yeah.  That must be it.  It's not that you're a pathetic narcissist.
 That's great.  A life lesson from a middle-age single mom who's dating a man-child.
 (calling after her) Fantastic.  Just stay away from my patient.
 Hanna...  We have to amputate your leg. (Cuddy looks up at him, surprised)
 There was.  And it's run out.
 You asked me how I'd hurt my leg.  I had a blood clot, and the muscle was dying.  And I had all these doctors telling me I should amputate, and I said no, and they did this... very risky operation.  I almost died.
 I wish I hadn't.
 They cut out a chunk of muscle about the size of my fist, and they left me with this, mutilated, useless thing.  I'm in pain...  Every day.  It changed me.  Made me a harder person, a worse person.  And now...  Now I'm alone.  You don't want to be like me.  You’ve got a husband who loves you.  You have friends.  You can start a family.  You have a life.  And this... This is just a leg.
 I got it.  (He picks up the amputation kit, taking responsibility for the amputation upon himself)
 I can't put you out.  It could depress your respiration too much.  This should take away some of the pain.  (He pushes a drug into her IV)
 I'll use a scalpel to slice through the skin, muscle, and fat.  That should go pretty fast.  Then I'll switch over to the electric saw when I get to the bone.  It's two bones... About as thick as a broomstick.  Takes about as long to get through.  I'm gonna cut as close to the concrete, as I can, save as much of your limb as possible.  Then the orthopedic surgeons back at the hospital will clean you up, have you fitted for a prosthetic.  You'll be running circles around me in no time.
 Like nothing you've ever felt before.
 (into the phone) What?
 What are his vitals?
 What do you mean, officer?  How long has there been a cop there?
 Was anything else making him nervous or worried before his other symptoms?
 Was his BP spiking?
 Yeah, it did.  All the caffeine.  We thought the problem was in his toilet —  by that, of course, I mean his head.  Which distracted us from the fact that it could have been just a clog in his sewer pipe, and by that, of course, I mean his spinal cord.  And blah, blah, blah, blah.  You get the idea.
 Run a CT—
 Breath sounds bilaterally.  It's not another pneumothorax.  (He puts his hands on both sides of her neck and turns her head from side to side) Neck vein’s flat.  There's no tamponade.  (to himself) Damn it, I went in too high. (to Hanna) Hanna, you've got a clot in your lung.  I'm gonna fix this.  (to the EMT) IV streptokinase.
 Her body won't get any oxygen unless we can bust the clot.  This is a blood thinner.
 It's gonna make her bleed more.  We'll take care of that next.
 It's not busting the clot.
 It's not a clot.  It's a fat embolism.  From the amputation.
 (turning toward Foreman and shouting) That's the point!  I did everything right.  She died anyway.  Why the hell do you think that would make me feel any better?
 (standing up and sounding menacing) I'm gonna give you a task as an employee.  Get out of my way.
 (inhaling) You going to leap across the room and grab them out of my hand?
 Okay.  Just so you know, I'm finding it hard to see the downside.
 Is that why you're here?  Foreman sent you?
 You here to yell at me again?
 Well, I'm running out of ideas.
 Oh, great.  You're feeling uncomfortable again.  Probably means you just got back from some quickie wedding in Vegas or you're already pregnant.
 (shocked) What?
 You think I can fix myself?
 'Cause I'm the most screwed-up person in the world.
 How do I know I'm not hallucinating?
 Nope.
 (also smiling sweetly, yes, sweetly)  Yeah.
Being moronic? Mm. If I can only think of a harm-free medical treatment she turned down lately.
 (Holding up two stuffed animals) Which of these says "I want to sleep with you" more?  Penguin or beaver?  Beaver, beaver, beaver.  You're right, it's too high school.
 (putting the animals back)  I can't be romantic?
 We're fine.  Never seen her happier.
 I'm... worried.
 (walking past Wilson and out the door) No, because I am.
 (turning to face Wilson) Ironic?  Weird?  Crazy?
 For now.  We're in the honeymoon period.  Our brains are flooded with endorphins.  Once she snaps out of it, where does that leave us?
 Name one thing that Cuddy and I have in common besides work.
 Exactly.  Long-term relationships are based on compatibility, and right now we only have sex.
 Not right away.  We'll fight, makeup sex, fight, maybe sex, and then she'll dump me.  With possible goodbye sex.
 I need to find something that we both like doing besides each other.
 No, then she'll start pretending to like things that she really doesn't just to make me feel better, which will make her feel even worse, which won't be my fault, so I'll resent her, and that won't be her fault, so she'll resent me.  (stopping at an elevator, House pushes the call button)  At least with my plan I get my one a day with iron till the bitter end.  (The elevator door opens and House steps in, with Wilson right behind him)  Is there a reason why you're following me?
 Great.  (He pushes aside the curtain with his cane) This won't take long then.
 Huge Jack Cannon fan, by the way.  Love your books.
 (pulling a lightscope out of his breast pocket) I know.  All they care about is who's hotter, Jack or Deacon.  Like Sarah can't love both of them.  I may belong to one or two online fan clubs.  (He looks into her eyes with the lightscope) How's the new book coming along?
'Kay.  How about nodding your head to a few yes/no questions?
 About anything?
 (dropping both their hands) Deal.  I will have to go with, why'd you try to kill yourself?  Burn on the side of your face is caused by gunpowder, so, change your mind at the last second, or you just a lousy shot?
 Can't.  We had a deal.
 Okay.  (loudly to the whole room) This woman is on a 72-hour psychiatric hold.  If she tries to run, shoot her.  With a sedative, if that's more convenient.
 A seizure while trying to commit suicide.
 What is the matter with you people?  We're talking about a human being who's suffering.
 Look, the point is if she kills herself, millions of fans of all ages and genders will be very disappointed.
 No, that would be crazy and unprofessional.  You're taking this case 'cause I said so.  You and Taub do a full workup.  Observe her overnight.  See if she has another seizure.  (looking at Chase) You can go.
 Because he brought a “smokin'” hot babe.
 Yeah, nice try, but you hate your personal life.  (to Foreman before he can protest) And you obviously don't have one.
 Hey.   (He pulls a red flower out of his bouquet and hands it to Chase who takes it and turns to join the young woman)  I'd stay myself, but I just bought the flowers.  (House leaves Taub and Foreman to observe Alice overnight)
 Reservation for Dominica's isn't till 8:00, so we got plenty of time.
 This is a Gothic Revival masterpiece.  I hope one day to live in a house like this.
 One of the best.  She wants me to read her latest manuscript.
 I gave you a couple of her books a few years ago.
 Ever hear of multitasking?
 Think I'd take the Dean of Medicine on a “B” and “E”
 (to Cuddy) Well, I guess you have your answer.
 She's probably illegal.  Same reason she didn't report the suicide attempt.
 And if she whacks herself, what happens to your job?
 I need to see her latest manuscript.
 A writer with back and hand pain.  That's very helpful.  Let's go.
 (lifting up the top of the typewriter)  True.
 Before there were hard drives, there were... (he holds up the ribbon reels)
 How many of these does she eat a day?
You wet the bed.  Just not sure how yet.
 (just entering the room) Explains the seizures, hand and back pain, also the depression.
 Put some lipstick on Chase and start chelation therapy.  Confirm with another urine test.  (The team stares uncertainly at House) Okay.  I'll go talk to Cuddy.  Maybe she'll let us borrow a dress too.  (House leaves the conference room)
 Ahe–ahem.
 I'm not the one talking about our relationship at work.
 Peace penguin.
 243.  I need some help with Alice Tanner.  She wants a vagina.
 I've been busy.
 You.  So you'll talk her out of it?
 You think we just sit around talking sports and belching and farting when the chicks aren't around?  (he burps)  By when?
 Next week it is.  (He leaves)
 It's the new Jack Cannon novel.  Suggestions?
 People wonder why you've never cured cancer.
 Eh, probably would have been a wiser choice.
 I'm a horrible influence.
 And not finding them.  (Wilson sighs)
 What was she doing when it happened?
 When her BP spiked?
 Her first symptom was when she had a gun to her head.  (peeling off the gloves) Excess adrenaline could explain seizures and skyrocketing BP.
 Get an MRI and find it.
 Would you hold this?
 I meant now.
 Normally I'd say it.  Maybe this way it'll finally sink in.
 She wants to die.  You cannot trust anything she says.
 We need to make her cooperate.  We have to offer her something she wants.
 I can work with that.
 I want you to write more books.
 Now don't you say that, you dirty birdie.  (He places his cane on top of a cabinet) You know, there are easier ways to go than shooting yourself in the head or tearing apart a limb.  (He pulls a drug bottle and syringe out of his coat pocket) And this is one of them.  The best part, you'll feel so good, you won't even notice you're dead.
 (filling the syringe from the bottle) You're the perceptive one.  You tell me.
 We can't find your tumor in time without your cooperation.  So I'm giving you a choice.  Give us a chance to make you better, or stick this anywhere and push.  (House holds up the full syringe)
 No.  I know pain.  You think you can handle it, and one day you can't.  When that happens, you either find reasons to go on, or you don't.
 Now.  When you're pain free, you're gonna want to live and start writing again.  And if I'm wrong, got a backup plan to take home with you.
 Good choice.  If I were you, I'd hide that if you want to keep it.
 Morning, sunshine.
 You were supposed to choose life.
 Wasn't lying about the cure.  If we find and remove that pesky, adrenaline-secreting tumor, you'll get better.
 Yeah, about that, it seems that last night you found and self-administered what you thought was a potentially lethal narcotic.  Your psych hold has been extended an additional 24 hours.  I know.  Bummer, right?
 Sure.
 There might be a way to get her symptoms without asking her.  If writers write what they know.
 And his mentor, Aunt Helen, who happens to be around the same age as Alice.  Answers could be in the book.
 Look for the tumor with the ultrasound.
 That's why I prefer lying.  It makes things easier.
 (to Sam) You told him?
 It is.  Patient wants to kill herself.
 (excitedly) You're a "fannon" too?
 Oh, come on.  Why can't she love them both?
 Let's say yes.
 No.  Debbie Wright is his true love.
 Presumed!  All we really know is—
 You don't like double dates?
 You don't like surprises?
 Sam reprogrammed the MRI to read Alice's typewriter ribbon.
 Cool, right?
 As your boyfriend, I thank you.  As your employee, I resent you, because I need this for my case.
 Whatever you want.
 Yeah?  And what would that be exactly?
 (taking off his glasses and looking up at them) Jack Cannon is not dead.  It's worse.  Ten books leading up to a final confrontation.  She ends it on a cliffhanger.  Who does that?
 She was gonna kill herself.  This is the final Jack Cannon.  Nothing gets resolved.  Who's his father?  Who killed his brother?  How'd he get that damn scar on his cheek, and why is he obsessed with yo-yos?
 Yeah.  I know why she wanted to kill herself.
 His mentor, Helen Rutherford, has contracted a serious illness, which consists of joint pain, fatigue, sensitivity to light, and depression.
 Helen dies halfway through the book.  Shoots herself in the head... to save Jack from having to care for her.
 Can't be lupus.
 It isn't curable.
 We're not gonna be able to take her pain away.  She's still gonna kill herself as soon as she gets released tomorrow.  I can't let Jack Cannon end this way.
 Retest to confirm.  (He leaves his office)
 Your mom said you loved go-carts.
 (looking over at Cuddy) You having fun?
 Whoa.
 She hates Jews!
 That a girl!
Hoo hoo hah hah hah!
 Oh, yeah?
 Yes!
 I avenged my Lady.
 It's not my fault Wilson's attracted to psychos.
 (having the “ah-ha” moment about Alice) Oh... wow.
 It was a car crash.  Not a skiing accident.
 Screws in your leg.
 You damaged your thyroid gland in the crash when the shoulder strap cut into your neck.  You don't have lupus.  What you have is curable.
 I read your book.  Sucks, by the way.
 Helen Rutherford kills herself because she feels useless and doesn't want to be a burden.
 Just like you do now.  You have hypothyroidism.  That's why you feel so tired and worn out.  With medication, you'll feel 20 years younger.  Or whatever age you were the last time you didn't want to kill yourself.
 You can finish the story the right way... The way Jack Cannon deserves.
 I know that he deserves better than what you gave him.
 How can I be right and wrong?  I deduced the car accident because thyroid fit the symptoms.  But a damaged thyroid wouldn't explain the paralysis.  How can I be wrong about the thyroid but right about the accident?
 I like the way you think kid.
 Do it.
 Aw... that's sad.  You know what's even sadder?  Thirteen was the only man on my team.
 (to Foreman) Do it.  Cuddy wants it to be a girl.
 I was talking to Chase.  I was just looking at you to screw with you.
 I'm meditating.
 You woke me up for that?
 Why would she lie about the accident?
 Everybody has a reason.  (He picks up his cane and leaves the office)
 She'll be dead in a few days without it.
 As your boyfriend, I'm grateful for the effort.  As your employee, I'm disappointed at your ineffectiveness.
 (sighing) Why would she not tell us about the pins in her leg?
 By having her leg ripped off?  She wants to punish herself... for something that happened before she was famous, before she even started to write.  I think the answer's in her old medical records.  But dopey, sleazy, and uptighty can't find them.
 Your boyfriend is an idiot.
 Her first name could be Helen.
 Don't bother to get up.  You know, the way you write Jack always made him feel real to me.  (putting the file down on the foot of the bed) Now I know why.
 He's cool, but he's awkward.  He's brilliant.  He makes mistakes.  (propping his cane against the bed) He's funny, but sometimes he takes it too far.  Sounds like a great kid.
 You weren't alone in the car crash.  Your son was with you, Helen.
 The books are your way of keeping him alive.
 You haven't been at peace since it happened.
 No, you didn't.
 No, you don't.
 (taking something else out of the file) Well, that may be true, but I've been reviewing your muse's autopsy results.  It wasn't the crash that killed him.  Your son had a brain aneurism.  That's why he crashed.  He was dead before the impact.  There was nothing you could do to save him.
 They had no reason to dig any deeper.  It was a car accident.  I did.  (holding up a skull Xray) It's easy to miss.  (pointing) But you can see the blood buildup here.  Your son would have died that day, on a bus, in school, sitting on his bed.  The only thing the crash is killing is you.  We need to repair that syrinx in your neck.
 Nope.  She shouldn't have let him drive in the rain.  Jack was never very coordinated.
 I don't.  I just wanted to save Jack Cannon.
 I find that very hard to believe.
 Because I lied about giving you the books.
 Oh.  Wilson told you.
 He's such a gossip.
I know you believe that now... But the fact is—
 Great.  You can dedicate the next Jack Cannon to me.
 Are you still in pain?
 Move on where?
 What about Jack?  Your last book didn't answer anything.
 (sounding like a whiny child) You — but that's stupid!  That doesn't make any sense!
 This is a book.  Books have beginnings, middles, and ends.  You can't just leave it on a cliffhanger — who does that?
 Your son... (House looks back to see Cuddy standing in the doorway, and resists the urge to be an ass) Was very lucky to have you as his mother.  (Cuddy is visibly relieved)
 Oh, shut up.
I know what you're thinking. She looks like Cameron, and he's hired her solely to sleep with her.
Well, you should have. But you'd be foolishly wrong. Yes, he's been dating at a near-Clooney pace recently, but at this point, the only hole he's trying to fill is the one in his soul, which means it's the emotional connection with Cameron that he misses. Did you ever marry a dying man? And if so, did you freeze his sperm?
Then why'd you make her wear Cameron's clothes?
Uh, uh, uh! If I know Dr. Shameron — and I think I do — she'll want this chance for a little stuff-strutting.
Liver angiogram to check for fibrosis. Search the home for heavy metals. [to Kelly] What's your position on the legality of illegal break-ins?
True. Cameron had much smaller breasts. By which I mean she was smarter.
Great. We've gotten to fifth base. That's two home runs, and then she gives me back a triple.
Am I wearing a dashiki? [Wilson chuckles] Easy Rider auditions ended four decades ago.
Nope. She comes over, we hook up, she leaves.
Mine. But I let her think it's hers. That's the fun of a relationship. You get the sex, the dinners… video game partnership. I also get a full-night's sleep.
As little as possible. That is one boring child.
I know. I'm grading on a curve. It's that bad.
I wasn't trying to eat shoes. Cuddy could have adopted a golden retriever.
We'll get to it when we get to it. [House walks away and looks at a couple of bikes.]
Nah. [pointing with his cane] This one's too metrosexual. This one's too heterosexual.
No.
Who'd drive my car home if I buy a bike?
Come back. Just one more time. You'll love it.
[He’s in bed, playing a video game and not looking at her.] I can't defeat the new Decimator 98 all alone. Come on, we're a team.
Oops, you're right. Scram. I've got a massage coming by in five.
Head shot!
Dorothy. Dorothy. Dorothy, dear… It's Aunt Em, darling.
Well, on the one hand, you've got some mysterious heart and tummy problems. On the other, you look great for a 65-year-old. So who are you? And, no, that's not some weird Canadian pronunciation of "how."
Well, that falls in the obviously stupid lie category, which you're familiar with from the one you told us about your bike accident. You thought we'd never check?
Well, I've got another name you can tell us instead. Yours.
Now, some person seemed to think that I was not being fair to you in our last DDX because I made you nervous. So this time, I'm gonna put you at ease. It's just you and old doc House. A couple of pals chittin' the chat.
Wednesday is when I get my shark tank cleaned. Also because… I'm giving her a chance.
This whole job is a test. I'm giving her the chance to fail it sooner rather than later. Or pass. Arrhythmia and elevated LFTs rule out hepatic fibrosis. So heart and stomach.
Explains the stomach, not the heart.
Explains the heart, not the stomach.
Explains the… nothing.
I'm sure she's already starting to think how, if we put the symptoms together with the abusive ex, the fact that she'd just eaten, the open door… [she look blank] Rhymes with moison…
Exactly. The counterargument is woof!
Treat with pralidoxime. [He leans over to look at Chase.] "A" for effort?
Yes. And you would have even it you hadn't told me that.
Brandi.
She is a hooker. If she's not slutty, she's doing something wrong.
Well, it was a massage plus happy ending sort of thing. Now it's more of a sad ending. [overly cheerful] Because of you! [serious now] I've tried 15 different massage therapists over the last few years. I don't know why, but she's the best I've found. She makes my leg feel better.
You don't mind the massage part, you mind the sex part, which doesn't exist anymore.
Why would I give up one who definitely works for one who might work?
That's not really an argument, now, is it?
Well, that's an argument.
Let's say you had a really fantastic handyman…
Would Sam ask you to stop using him because you might have had a sexual relationship with him in the past?
This is not a point of pride. This is a point of principle.
The principle is she's being irrational. If I give in on this, it sets the stage for the whole relationship.
You finally made a good point.
[leaving] The kitchen's burning.
Just letting you all share in the joys of my last trip to Carlsbad Caverns. Which the husband probably would have beaten up if he'd found it in the address book. [to Kelly] Would you mind standing next to the screen?
She isn’t already?
Right, Dr. Kelly!
What's your point, Dr. Robert?
Snapilicious! But as I always like to say, it's better to be a helpful Helen than a negative Nelly. So while you're cooking up some ideas of your own, allow me to present theory 2.0 of why Chase hired you. Dr. Kelly, meet your doppelganger. [a picture of a diseased foot shows on the screen] Oh, no. Hold on a second.
Never mind the baby, peep the babe. Note the cheekbones and eye shape.
I know what you're thinking, Chase wants to sleep with his mom. But who wouldn't hit that if that looked like that? It's a classic case of what Freud called—
What do you mean he's wrong? It is about your mom?
So it's about…
Okay, forget the mom theory. Go water the patient, treat for Legionnaire's.
Well, you get major points for trying to trick me. Unfortunately, you lose 'em all for failing. Hold that. Hold that. See, now you're frowning. You can really see the resemblance.
He was? Huh. That doesn't bother me at all. I guess we both learned a valuable lesson.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a straight male hooker? [She starts to leave. He follows her.] Oh, come on. It's a massage. I don't care who gives it to you. Why not treat me the same way?
Why would I do that? We're doing fine.
How about you?
You won't let me sleep over. You basically haven't introduced me to your daughter.
Honestly… before this, I'd have said no. But… yeah. How are we ever gonna be a couple if you keep hiding her from me?
Call it what it is. I'm not the only one who's holding back.
It's hit her brain, whatever it is.
Which would get us nowhere. So let's assume it's something. What kind of something?
So her mind just happens to fall apart right after her body? Wow, I thought I was having a bad week.
You know what, I'm back to the Cameron theory. That you hired the dumb version of Cameron so that you could fire her and get revenge.
Oh, you've switched sides? Let me guess, Chase represents the dumb version of Thirteen…
You are a true leader of men. Get someone to cut into her head and get me a biopsy.
Why wasn't she frozen? This morning? Put a healthy person on a cooling blanket, they'd be chilled like a fine Chardonnay. She's a nice warm Merlot. 98.6 all day.
So you titrated the blanket. As her fever dropped, you lowered the power.
So it's been on the lowest setting since when?
Which means we could have known that her fever was gone yesterday afternoon.
When did she last puke?
Two down. Shooting for three.
Nope. But it might be. [He disconnects it. Nothing happens.] No tachycardia, there's only the delusions left. If they're even still there.
[epiphany] You couldn't be more wrong. You've got the cause and effect backwards. Start her on haloperidol and Lorazepam. Give it a few hours to take effect. Call me when she wakes.
Can you hear me? What are you looking at?
If it was, think I'd be able to do this… [places hand in “fire”] without screaming for my mommy? [The flames disappear.]
Don't be too impressed. It's mostly the happy pills you put her on. But she can talk to us now. The obviously stupid lie you told us about your hospital records, it turns out to have been un-obviously un-stupid. You thought you wouldn't get caught because you thought that you'd be cured and back home by the time we spoke to the other hospital. Because you knew what was wrong with you. Your doctor was treating you with Risperidone, right? That's why you were in Trenton. You got the stomach pain, you went to see him, he wanted you to taper off.
Not the one you know about. If you haven't figured it out by now, your wife has a secret.
The ex was not so much a secret, more of a lie.
She's sick. She's been sick for years. Maybe it put you on the streets. Maybe that's where you got the broken bones. She's only suffering from one condition. Everything else is side effects of the drug that was treating it. She stopped taking the drug, the side effects faded. But the underlying disease is still there. Why don't you tell your husband.
That's the kind of thing that a recent psychiatric resident might have figured out.
Nothing. Her physical symptoms are gone. We'll put her on a different anti-psychotic for the mental ones. You can take a nap.
Of course she is. You just didn't know it.
Sorry, as your marriage counselor, I'm not allowed to talk to you without your wife present.
Look, if you want me to give you a reason to leave her, fine. Apparently you haven't noticed, but she's got a serious mental illness.
It's always hard.
Up to you.
Nope. But she got me to the right answer, which none of the rest of you did. If you want to give her another shot, go for it.
Great. It'll make it easier for you to sleep with her. [He leaves the elevator, talking over his shoulder to Chase.] Come on, why else would you have hired her?
I got bored with the porn on my computer. You got any girl on girl on girl on vibrating object on girl stuff? I wouldn't have to do this if you gave me the name of that physical therapist you like.
Ehh… Knobby hands.
Will you get cable?
Then we'll have to have more sex.
This is meat? [She smiles.] Yes, please. [He hands her his plate and smiles.]
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, kid. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. [He gently pries the cane from her hands and mouth.] Hey, hey, hey.
[sourly] Aren't you adorable.
Cancel your dinner plans. [Taub, Foreman, and Chase open the files] Short on medical history. She's only eight hours old. What she's not short on is doctors. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to solve her breathing problems.
[brief pause] Silent reading time till I get back. [he follows Cuddy]
[shrugs] That's a problem.
Oh, you've really got a problem.
Love to, but I'm catching up on my back issues of Nudist Circus. You should see what the fat lady's got under her big top.
I got a sick baby here who needs me. Yours is healthy.
How about a little something extra when you get home?
For what?
Fine. Out of the goodness of my heart, which will make you happy, which will make you desire me more, which will turn into more sex.
What if her lung problems are not coming from her lungs?
When the liver fails, it stops producing proteins. Specifically the ones that keep your plasma inside your blood vessels and outside your lungs. Fix the liver, she'll have enough breath to keep the entire ward up all night. [the team begins to get up] Foreman... you need to stay after school. [the remainder of the team leaves the room] I apparently need to apologize. Last week, I should not have gone over your head and allowed Chase to hire a new team member. So go hire someone who liked The Bridges of Madison County.
Go find a woman, and wipe that self-satisfied grin off your face.
Well, narrow it down to one before Cuddy starts withholding sex.
I said, wipe the grin. [he leaves the room. Foreman looks after him almost affectionately.]
Your mommy says no, 'cause she's mean. [shrugs] If it was up to me...
No. Go back to bed. [she runs into the dining room instead.] I said bed! [she looks back at him mockingly and heads around the table]
Wilson! Hey. [smiles] You up for a boys' night in?
[sitting on Cuddy's couch with Rachel, attempting to calm her down] Just talking in a soothing voice. Not for your benefit. [cut back to team] Why? Is it turning you on? [Taub looks uncomfortable]
Nice to meet you. [high, squeaky voice] You're fired.
You had the misfortune to be the lesson that Foreman is learning. That whooshing sound is the air being let out of his ego.
No, I'm not sure I could have. [Chase looks tired, and Taub and Foreman dispirited] I think you give me far too much credit. Taub... [cut back to House and Rachel] it's your turn to find a young doctor who's actually excited to have this job.
Not until you or she earns it. [cut back to team] Dilated bile ducts could be congenital.
So, open her up.
And you were dumb enough to believe me. [Wilson walks into the house and sees Rachel. House picks up his jacket] Cuddy'll be back in an hour and ten minutes... I'll be back in an hour and five.
Oh, yes, I do.
Yes, I am. [he begins putting on his coat] 'Cause unlike you, I don't have a conscience.
Sure. I'm leaving her with you. A responsible adult. [he opens the door and leaves]
It's kind of bugging you, isn't it?
[they descend the steps to the sidewalk] Well, since, objectively, you care more about leaving a child alone than I do, it kind of is.
[mounts his motorcycle] True, and yet it is. Because you're you.
I'm leaving.
[confidently] You're not gonna leave. You can't. [Wilson struggles with that for a minute]
[he considers that, then turn off his engine as well.] I'll stay if you stay. [Wilson stands there for a long moment.]
[still appearing rather shellshocked] What have you got there, sweetie? [Rachel looks amused. Wilson kneels cautiously in front of her.]
[coaxingly] Come on now, spit it out.
[now in the foreground] Rachel... how many coins did you eat? [Wilson nods encouragingly in the background. Rachel looks from one to the other and doesn't answer. House and Wilson look at each other.]
Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?
[shrugs] Well, he could have shortchanged you. Fridge magnet's not getting anything.
Really? [Wilson nods] I mean, kids swallow things all the time, right? [Wilson shrugs] I mean, she swallowed a dime, she poops it out. She'll be fine.
[hissing] Yeah? What are you gonna tell her? Are you gonna tell her that... you left coins out? [he advances on Wilson, who backs away] And you left her child unsupervised?!
...One time.
She's fine. [Cuddy smiles and kisses him] How about I stay the night? Then you can really thank me.
I'm a deep sleeper. [Cuddy smiles and heads into her bedroom. House starts to follow her, but stops to look guiltily at Rachel's door.]
[leans over her for a split-second, then leaves the room at a run] Relax, I got this.
[cringes at the smell] Pfft! [Rachel laughs. House puts a small light in his mouth and begins examining the contents of Rachel's diaper. Cuddy wanders in, still looking half-awake.]
[snatches the light out of his mouth] Yeah, sorry, I'm just... new to all this.
[opens one eye] God, no. Case is under control. I'm sleeping in.
I assume, since you're calling so early, that the surgery was a rousing success.
I believe this is what your people term a "poopy call".
Well, I don't know what you're doing, but this is a poopy call.
[confusedly] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?! I know about the Jew, the black, and the croc-hunter, but when did we get our Asian persuasion on?
Well, then I just wasted a perfectly good racial epithet.
Good call... Except for everything you just said. There's no way that our patient has a vascular malformation. [stands up from Cuddy's bed.]
Don't need to be there to remember that the patient's A.L.T.s were three times normal. The baby's liver damage is far too extensive. Dr. Cheng's an idiot.
Well, then you're an even bigger idiot for trying to cover for her.
[pause] No, she didn't. Call me when she crashes again. [hangs up]
[cautiously pushing the cart inside] You see a double-wide tuchus coming this way, you scream like a girl.
She's two! Last night, she was whining about the giant moose that lives outside her window. [they hurry through the lobby. Cuddy can be seen emerging from the clinic in the background.]
[annoyed] She hates that moose.
[to Taub over the phone] Make it short. And do not pardon the pun. [Wilson gestures for the ultrasound wand, and House hands it to him.]
[backs into the door, where a "no cell phones' sign is visible] Is it actually important that I understand what you say?
Yeah?
I'm shocked! Oh, no, wait a minute — that's you.
Hold that thought. [he presses the phone into his shoulder and goes to stand next to Wilson.]
[worried] It's nothing. It's just an irregularity.
Or a pocket of air.
That's not a face. It's a shadow.
Well, move the wand to the side.
[shakes his head] We need an X-ray to be sure.
Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad.
He also has an outstanding bedside manner. [Taub still looks suspicious]
The interesting question is not why she's worse now, but why she got better in the first place.
What'd you put her on again?
But not the multiple dilated ducts.
Cancer kid trumps liver kid. [he enters the room and Taub tries to follow him.] Sorry. Confidentiality. There are rules, you know. [he slams the door in Taub's face]
[looks at the monitor] It looks mobile. And it's right in the middle of the colon. Prime location for pooping out. We'll give her some laxatives to help it on its way.
[looks at Wilson and takes the ultrasound wand back from him] You're gonna make a great mommy one day. [He gets his epiphany-face and rushes to the door. Taub is still outside.] Thanks for waiting. Hook the mom up to the baby. Direct blood transfusion.
Nothing else. [He retreats into the exam room, and Taub gapes at the door.]
Mother's touch.
Or a miracle.
I have no idea.
Our patient can either go through life with the world's longest umbilical cord, or we can discuss the differential for magic blood. [The door slides open, and Dr. Cheng walks out. Taub beckons to her.]
Either you're Dr. Cheng, or you're early for my mani-pedi.
Could tell us the O2-stats. [speaks to Cheng] I hope you come with some original ideas. [Chase does a double-take.]
Given the liver failure, a deficiency of clotting factors, enzymes, or vitamins are the most likely.
Find a donor.
Hook yourself up. Dr. Cheng, hook me up. Walk with me. [they head down the hall.] My team seems to have taken a shine to you.
I assume you're hanging around because you want a job.
Well, I'm gonna have to test you. Let's say, two-year-old... swallowed a coin twenty hours ago. She's gonna be fine, right?
For the purposes of this quiz, let's say "not yet".
[look uncomfortable] Define "too long."
And then what do I do? [hastily] I mean, what do you do? It's your test.
[enters the men's bathroom] It's not up to me. Talk to Taub.
[to Wilson, who's giving Rachel laxative candies] Men's room?
Oh, Cuddy's been in here.
[leers at Wilson] Is there such a place? [brings himself back to the situation at hand.] Okay, six more hours, then we're going in with a scope and pulling it out.
And as you keep pointing out, so is a dime ripping through her intestines.
I could offer to baby-sit again, let her have the night out.
I wish I was nicer. [something catches his eye] Hey. Give me your radiation dosimeter.
Because it matches my eyes. [Wilson gives up and hands him the dosimeter. House leaves.]
[looks confused] That had to be intentional. I mean, why would anyone—
[overly dramatic] Nooo...
[whiny] Two nights in a row?
I have a life, you know.
I am not going to bargain babysitting for sex. [is distracted by said cleavage] Who the hell said that? Of course I will.
That's it? [is distracted by the team's take-out meal] How come no one got me food?
Boring. Since the baby has the melanoma, we kind of already knew the mom had it.
Great. So treat her. Also boring. What's interesting is that mom's melanoma spread to the baby in-utero, which means it's metastatic, which means it's late stage. How many people with a late stage melanoma are as healthy as she is?
Antibodies.
Exactly, which means it's fighting something else, and the melanoma cells are getting caught in the crossfire. So what's mom's immune system really shooting at?
See, Dr. Cheng? This is not boring. [she smiles] Start with auto-immune. Go test her blood. [to Taub] And leave your food. [Taub picks up his meal and stalks out of the room. House looks disgruntled.]
I'm aware that this is a delicate procedure. I'm also aware that my hands are shaking from low blood sugar 'cause I haven't eaten all day. So while this may seem insensitive, this crucial, lifesaving moo shoo — [he looks in the paper bag and is pulled up short] where are my extra pancakes? Damn it, they forgot the extra pancakes for my moo shoo pork. Every time that new girl with the blue streak in her hair answers the phone, they screw up.
Was she there when you picked up the food?!
[points to the paper] 55 cents. And there were two.
Was—
[together] $18.42.
Was obviously just a pocket of air, like I said all along. But you saw the worst case scenario... [sits next to Wilson] ...like every irrational, worried parent. [leans forward and snags the bag of food from the table, then settles back down.] You'd make a terrible mommy. [digs in the bag.]
[eyes still closed] This one's all yours.
...I did.
Sausagefest implies multiples. Now, if you're talking about yardage, I'd have to agree.
It's coming along.
I've found plenty of someones. Just haven't kept them.
She'll be incredibly useful if my next patient is an Escher drawing. Those things are seriously screwed up.
Just because my sausage has been filling your bun, it doesn't mean you get to decide what flavor chips I nosh on during the day.
Otherwise known as rash and liver damage. Fascinating.
Black guy campaigning for the opposition? Does Obama know about this?
Martha M. Masters? I'm Dr. House. This is the rest of the team. Boring, Bimbo, and Bite-size. Martha enjoys quadratic equations, Italian frescoes, and her turn-ons include learning to be a doctor. Take a seat.
Cuddy thinks she's some kind of genius. Say something brilliant.
Capital of Azerbaijan?
Year Beethoven died?
20th decimal of Euler's number?
She's like the Internet with breasts. Oh, no, wait… the Internet has breasts. (He sits down.)
Now all we've gotta do is figure out which one is bimbo and which one is bite-size. Also, which monster truck won the 2004 thunder nationals?
The answer we were looking for is Virginia Giant. Feel free to chime in on either conversation. (she nods.)
Go to his house, get me some chemicals. (addressing Masters) You wanna stay on this team, have an opinion. (she leaves the room with the team.)
E coli is found in animals. So unless he's drinking pork cider… (Having a fake epiphany) Pork cider! (Points at Taub) I need the number of the patent office.
Interesting. Which raises the question, (looking suspiciously at Taub) what is your problem with her?
Why would that bother Taub? He's been working with people smarter than him for a long time. I think perky new girl makes him feel old.
Yeah, but she's a student. Makes you contemplate your med school days. Back when you had hair, muscle tone, and no need for a regular prostate exam.
Which would mean our esteemed patient is literally full of B.S. Cool. Go get the ingenue, start the patient on aztreonam and plasmapheresis.
So, what causes rash, liver failure, clots, and the uncontrollable urge to rat out your coworkers? Oh, no, wait… (He leans close to Masters.) That last one was you, not the patient.
Hooray! (He throws his cup full of confetti at her to celebrate her first diagnosis) You popped your cherry, diagnostically speaking. Unfortunately, the first time always sucks. Pitch doesn't make any sense. Dugan's cornea was normal. You're obviously brilliant. So why would you hide your mind?
I'm not talking about your stupid ideas about the patient. I mean your stupid ideas about morality.
Rules are just helpful guidelines for stupid people who can't make up their own mind. You obviously don't fit into that category, so why put yourself there?
And honesty's a great idea until your patient asks if her distended abdomen makes her looks fat.
CT from his neck to his abdomen for neuroendocrine tumors. Run a D-dimer and fibrinogen for D.I.C.
Masters. If lying to a patient saved their life, would you do it?
That's a lie. If your grandma gave you a really crappy tea cozy for Christmas, would you tell her you liked it?
So, you lie when it doesn't matter but you won't when it does. How'd you get so screwed up? (He leaves the room.)
How mad would you be if I fired Masters?
Never mind, then. She's got principles. She's like the love child of Einstein and Mary Poppins. Didn't even get Einstein's hair.
It is gray!
It does not… (sighs) You thought I'd get defensive, keep her out of pride.
So this guy spends his entire life campaigning against bleeding hearts. And it turns out he has one.
Yeah, if I say something inaccurate, assume it's for comic effect. Then laugh,
She can't diagnose a joke, but she's making progress on the patient.
We treat with chemotherapy.
Then you said, "or."
The road to dead patients is paved with "or"s. Chemo is the more effective treatment, which means it'll confirm our diagnosis more quickly.
There are lots of other options. There's bloodletting, crystals, prayer…
Which is both less effective and less scary. So the patient might just choose it. Unless, of course, we don't mention it to him.
Well, as long as you're sure.
Oh, my goodness! (He was standing behind Masters) If only someone could've predicted that you'd make that incredibly stupid decision. (Masters looks at House)
Would that I could, but ethics dictate that it's his decision. So all I can do now is return to my office knowing, even as my patient endangers himself, my integrity remains unblemished.
Good. The wrong medicine is the right medicine.
He wants to live.
No, you're not. (he takes off his glasses) I don't mind your morality in theory. But in practice, you're risking my patient's life. So you're fired.
If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school.
I know. But unlike you, I'm willing to lie.
You're incapable of noticing when I do something inappropriate?
Your opponent's out of the race. You can drop the smear campaign.
Masters was wrong. He doesn't have H.S.P. And Masters is gone.
That's a great idea if he was running a political campaign in Africa. The guy hasn't been out of the country in years.
Well, break into his home, get me some escargots. Unless you wanna ask the patient's permission as a tribute to the departed.
I did! She used that opportunity to endanger our patient's life.
That's what I just said!
No problem. Just find her a different department. (He leaves the office with one last glance at Masters.)
Yeah.
What'd you find?
There's gotta be something. Dugan's going completely downhill. Now fluid's collecting in his chest. Where the hell are you guys?
Uh… kinda busy. (He hangs up.)
There you are. (Masters turns to him) I was starting to think that my holier-than-thou-dar was malfunctioning. Our patient's liver, kidneys, and lungs are failing. I need you to help me figure out why. (he sits down in front of her.)
They're in jail.
Prostitution. So you're rehired.
Yeah, I don't need to hear your ideas. Just return the volley.
Nope. His vitamin A level is normal.
Cholecystitis?
Did you just shush me?
The technical term is speaking.
He screwed you.
No, I mean he actually screwed you. Taking weekend trips down to Bunbury. He's got a red blotch on his hand. That's palmar erythema. That, and the fact that he's got a permanent sheen of nixonian flop sweat. He's got hepatitis C, which explains all your symptoms.
Well, then the two of you shot up together.
Actually, quite a few. (he walks to a cupboard, opens it and picks up a syringe) Look, I know you've got hep C. So either you shared a bed together, you shared a needle, or you shared a straw. I'm talking about coke, not coke.
Don't care.
This is interferon. It delays the onset of rigor mortis. (He leaves.)
Great news. I've decided to rehire you.
Dugan's got hep C.
He's not responding to interferon.
Ethics and self-esteem? You really are a pain in the ass. What treats hep C besides interferon?
Yeah.
Come on, stop pretending you're not gonna do this. As much as you hate me, you hate failing more.
But if you walk away now, after I just rehired you, that's quitting.
There's one thing that mimics hep A… Hep A. Good work. (Heading off the elevator.) You're fired.
Hep A could cure him.
Tell the lab to release a hep A culture to me. We'll see who's right.
Listen to the genius.
I've given you…
I can't.
That's also true of five morons. (He leaves.)
Well, considering the fact that I'm about to do something unethical…
Missed you.
We need a false positive hep C test.
The world changes when you're on the inside. You just gotta roll with it once you get out.
Evidence, not proof.
Should be, but it won't be.
False false positive. That's the best we can do? Okay, go do it.
But it doesn't make any sense.
I wouldn't be lying as her boyfriend. I'd be lying as her employee.
My patient is gonna die.
No.
Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator who got hep C from doing cocaine? You didn't fill out any paperwork. I'm gonna run this test under an assumed name. Trust me… No one will ever know you were here. (He writes Dugan’s name on the blood vial.)
Blood test confirming hep C. He got sicker, his viral load came up, finally showed up on the test.
I've come a long way, baby.
I'm on it. (He leaves.)
How'd you like to come work for me?
We've had this conversation. You want this job.
Prove yourself to me, no more games. At least, the current game ends. Others may start. You have my deeply-flawed word.
Get Dugan to let us give him hep A. And while you're figuring out the best way to coax a patient into a treatment that has an 85% mortality rate, here's some advice: Don't.
You have a math degree. So let's see if you can follow along here. You lie to him, he definitely consents, he might live. You tell him the truth like last time, he might not consent, he definitely dies. Remind me what's so wrong about lying?
Oh, I'm sure some other people would suffer.
And you feel good about that?
So I'm hiring an idiot.
Or I want a front row seat when you wake up and realize how useless your principals are. I don't want you to just lie to a patient. I want you to want to lie to a patient.
See you tomorrow.
If I knew hiring her meant dealing with medical school paperwork, I might've reconsidered. You really got nothing better to do than watch me sign this?
She had me when she called you a coward. You gonna hang out?
Why aren't you guys in my office?
 What you got against chickens?  One got choked last night, thanks to you.
 Can't we even talk about it?
 I'm not apologizing for doing the right thing.
 I lied to save my patient's life.  I didn't lie to you.  I lied to my boss.  Either of those arguments working yet?  (Cuddy turns and walks back toward the clinic) I guess that means I don't have to go to the wedding on Saturday.
 I loathe weddings and their seven levels of hypocrisy.  But you do seem awfully hissy.  And there's an outside chance that I could get you drunk and score.  So as long as you don't take it as an admission of guilt, sure, count me in.  (The elevator arrives and the doors open)  A bit too much honesty?
 Housekeeping.  Either you're crazy or you're atoning for something naughty, and you're crazy.
 That answers that.  Thanks.
 With your health insurance carrier?
 Oh.
 So how did that negotiation go?  You lowballed with ear piercing and God countered?
 Pontius Pilate — misunderstood oncologist.
 Well, at least your daughter has one viable role model.
 I did.  Then I grew my curly hairs.
 Maybe you were misdiagnosed in the first place.
 Causal determinism.  We are hardwired to need answers.  (House gets down off the table and approaches the bed) The cave man who heard a rustle in the bushes checked out to see what it was lived longer than the guy who assumed it was just a breeze.  The problem is, when we don't find a logical answer, we settle for a stupid one.  Ritual is what happens when we run out of rational.
 Good.  Another hole in him should really make God's day.
 Why are you late?  Your next dental appointment isn't till January, and you just saw your GP eight days ago.  (House puts the file on the desk and scratches his chest) You think stage IV glioblastoma in an eight-year-old could disappear in three weeks?
 Your tires got less than 5,000 miles on them.  No, and neither does my patient's daughter.
 There's no construction site between here and your home.  I agree.  I think it was a misdiagnosed cyst.
 I don't know yet.  But you would have dropped off your tie.  It's got a mustard stain.
 (looking at the ring) That is the second stupidest thing I've heard today.  And I'm surprised how close you came.  (House closes the box and tosses it back to Wilson)  You don't need to buy her a new ring.  Isn't the first one good for all you can marry?
 Nothing to apologize for.
 You want me to lie?
 Everybody lies.  I'm sure Cuddy…
 (getting up and hurrying out the door) Just need to give her a chance.
 Fever, coughing up blood, coughing up teeth.  So either God sweetened the deal with a "no flossing" clause or…
 Heavy metal it is.  Do a home search and a peripheral smear.
 He stops and turns to Taub) Trying to catch your wife cheating?
 Missing mojo.  Posture's slumped.  Expression defeated.  Didn't try to back up
 Shopkeeper.  I need a patient file.
 Not one of our patients.  My patient's daughter.
 He thinks I only want it to debunk his faith.
 Because he's strangely perceptive for an idiot.
 You keep me happy, I return the favor.  Think of it as tat for tit.
 It's my dressy casual.  What do you think?
 If you prick me, do I not bleed?
 You sure?  'Cause that sounds so juvenile.  (Cuddy leaves)
 It's locked.
 I'll wait.
 Thought you could take a look at it for me.
 With what?
 And yet these files are not from this hospital.  These are from where-my-fiancee-works memorial.
 Which explains why Sam is too busy to look at my file.
 You don't want to propose at a wedding.  Emotions running high, people on edge.  You ought to try somewhere like a Buddhist temple or an aquarium.  Or a Buddhist aquarium.  That only took ten seconds.  You can spend the rest of the time on my file.
 Classic Neurohecatia.  Two days of anticholinergics, you'll be walking out of here.
 No.  I just made that up to see your reaction.  Diagnostic test.  This is awesome.  33-year-old carpenter presenting with narcissism, delusions of grandeur,
 I'm not talking about him.  I'm talking about "him" with a capital "o-m-g."
 I think you offended him.
 Get an MRI of his brain. Let's see if we can find God.
 I forged your signature.
 Think of it as a present.  See, somebody is about to turn the big 4-5 in several months, and somebody else wants to make a very big deal of it.
 4-3.  Are you sure?
 How could I make such a mistake?  In reading your HR file?  Oh, no, wait, I didn't.  And (loudly) boom goes the dynamite.  Scores are tied.  We are even-steven.
 You lied to make yourself older?  Are you lying about being a woman?
 My point is you already have.  I just need to prove it.
 How are you feeling?
 Obviously.  Where are your friends?  Still casting lots for your clothes?
 Always sacrificing.  Very inspirational.  The lesions are in your temporal lobes.  When those areas get messed with, people have strange experiences — like hauntings, alien abductions, past lives.
 I'd settle for agnostic.
 No, of course not.  On the other hand, it is communicable, and it kills a lot of people.
 You feel that?
 Your friends are not praying hard enough.
 Let's put it to the vote.  (holding one in each hand) Vest or cummerbund?
 You know me.  I can't say no to any of you guys.  You're all correct.  He has M.S.  But not the friendly Mr. Rogers M.S.  This is the weird guy in the panel van kind.
 What did I just say?
 That's unless we can get someone to nail themselves to a cross as soon as possible.  Or, stem cell treatment.
 I know that, and you know that.  He doesn't know that.  But now she knows that, he's gonna know that.  Way to go.
 Confirm Marburg.  Then see if he's a fair-weather flagellator.
 (imitating Sean Connery) You look smashing, Miss Moneypenny.
 So either God intervened, which is a lazy explanation, or we just don't know why.  Which is no explanation.
 Which annoys me to no end.
 Your woman is fudging the facts.  Five of those cases, the stated doses don't explain the radiation damage.
 Not that much.
 'Cause morally she didn't.  All five patients were terminal.  She exceeded the dosing protocols to try to save their life.  You would have done the same.  She's a sap, and she's perfect for you.  (House leaves the office)
 I hate rehearsal dinners almost as much as I hate weddings.
 Even though we know in two years their lawyers are gonna be fighting over the Bentleys.
 She's got looks. He's got money.  One of them is bound to run out.
 That's very specific.
 Oh. Thought I was supposed to be the dark one.
 (into the phone) Yeah.
 (to Cuddy) You're gonna have to go stag.  My patient is refusing treatment.
 No.  But it's an excuse you can't argue with.
 You already broke it.  Your blood test showed you were loaded with ibuprofen.
 The point is to suffer like your savior did, right?  Well, he didn't take myrrh, the Tylenol of ancient Rome.  And his nails went through his wrists, not through his palms.  Palms are for sissies.  And what about the 39 lashes and the beatings and the crown of thorns?  What you go through is closer to a bad manicure than a crucifixion.
 Don't make this about your daughter.  (House rolls the stool closer to the bed) You're just worried that if we find a cure, that it'll cost you your faith.  And then you'll be like the rest of us.
 Sticking by your convictions and damning the consequences.  You two have a lot in common.  You're both idiots.
 Just when they're applied indiscriminately to all circumstances.
 (nodding) Get her in here.
 Someone looks lovely tonight.
 I meant me.  Someone else looks simply stunning.  That was you.  And the blonde at the bar.
 It's not an act.  It's the wedding.
 I thought I did.  Then I realized I've never been to one.
 Turns out they're kind of fun.
 What would you wear?
 Traditionally for young, first-time brides.
 That is a lie.  (she looks at him in disbelief) You were married before.  1987 for six days.  (Cuddy looks at him questioningly) Your knowledge of New Jersey divorce law made me suspicious, so I looked it up.
 Uhh, a trap's primitive.  I prefer inveiglement.  Anyway, the point is, I lied to you, you lied to me, I forgive you.
 (talking about Chase) So how many do you think?
 Hat trick, Chase.  (He picks up a glass of champagne from the table and takes a sip) See?  The life of the bachelor.  All of the sex, none of the guilt.
 That makes a lot more sense.
 (grabbing his jacket and cane and leaving them) I have one more test to run.
 It won't be long now.  You'll be staring down the yawning void before you know it.
 Nope.  I came from a wedding to run a PET scan.
 I have.  PET scan was for your daughter.  I was wrong about her.  She did have glioblastoma.  And she still does.  The cancer never went away.
 Which misses all the tiny, little tumors that a PET scan doesn't.
 I ran it twice.  No mistake.  Looks like God broke your deal.  I'm sorry.  But I'm also right.
 Good call.
 Got something to show you.  Your daughter's PET scan.  It's clean.  She's fine.  My bad.  Got her mixed up with Marion Silver.  Marisa Silva.  That's believable, right?  Anyhow, good news for you, bad news for Mr. Silver.
 And God will punish you for that.
 Cause if he didn't, well, that would make you wonder, wouldn't it?
 Well, that's why I'm so confused by this.  (He holds up a MRI scan film) This is your MRI.  Shows incremental improvement.  You're getting better.  I double-checked the name on this one.  But it's not all good news.  This patient is screwed.  (He holds up a third film) Technical term is dead as a doornail.
 God.  You broke your deal with him, your daughter's fine, you're getting better.  Nothing bad happened.  Which can only mean one thing.  There is no God.  Of course, if your daughter gets hit by a meteorite today, I would have some serious egg on my face.
 You're smiling.  I assume that means you're miserable.
 Punishment is proof of God, and no punishment is proof of God?  Ingenious argument.
 Everyone I could trust.  So yes.
 Either you're naïve or you have scruples.  I'm not sure which is worse.
 I can.
 I've been an idiot.  I got this argument stuck in my head.  If everybody lies, then trust is not only unfounded and pointless, it's fictional.  But trust is not an argument that can be won or lost.  Maybe I just have to suspend my cynicism and believe.  Maybe it's time I took a leap of faith.  (pause)  I'm sorry.  I won't lie to you again.
 What a moron.
 I meant you.
 Cuddy's coming over.
 I apologized to her.
 Not really.  I lied.  (He turns to face Wilson) I just took your advice.  Too bad you didn't.
You are adorable. Heroism does exist.
News flash — that guy was already on the plane. For all we know, he would have killed everyone else on board if it increased his chances. Faced with almost certain death, a normal person rides the pine.
The guys who undergo months of training to deny their own instincts for self-preservation?
Waldenwood. Is that by any chance a boarding school? Or a work camp?
Blocks made of gold… Kids don't have to pick their own noses…
You sure that's the right place for her? Sounds a little snobby.
[without taking his eyes off the screen] Shh-shh-shh.
Yes, just not me. Your mom is a 65-year-old woman with high blood pressure.
Borderline, which is the lab equivalent of imaginary, which, by the way, matches the rest of her medical history.
So get her a cardiologist. You don't want me involved. You don't want you involved. All that ethics stuff that I don't give a crap about suddenly makes sense. If you're emotionally invested, you cannot make rational decisions. You know this would be a disaster.
[smiling “pleasantly”] Treadmill test went well — no chest discomfort or ischemia. The abnormal rhythm will probably resolve itself, and if not, a daily pill will keep it under control. I will follow up later today.
There are 15 years of clinic visits in this file.
[opening the file] So… we're looking for a disease that can last a decade and a half, causes constipation, diarrhea, flu, cold, dizziness, rashes, back and joint pain, "heart feeling weird," "kishkes feeling wobbly," one actual hip replacement. And which has eluded detection by years of blood work, X-rays, and MRIs. Well, one thing does pop to mind.
Mexican herbal medication for stomach problems, but only in the sense that lead chromate is an herb and poison is a medication.
You know… that's not the only thing they found in her home.
Nope. Just some stuff that could cause severe nausea and permanent erectile dysfunction… and which proves that your mom is doing the help. According to her diary, it's some contractor named Jesus… which, granted, was originally a Jewish name, but…
You know, texts, calls, and emails all go to the same magic device these days. You only got to send one.
[playing nice] Yeah, that's a crazy mystery. It's not like I got a department to run.
True. But it could cause the 5% that are real.
Well, let me answer this way— maybe you're imagining that I think you're a hypochondriac.
I did… when I was typing it up, right before I slapped it on a bottle of sugar pills.
Did it work?
My God, a woman getting better wants to leave the hospital?
It couldn't be more because. If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed herself with six new forms of cancer. She'd never leave.
Wait. I'm sorry she's sick. I'm not sorry I'm off the case.
You don't think you can convince her—
Top of the morning, Dr. Kaufman. Here's the deal. You copy me
I thought you spoke to Cuddy.
Listen, Kauffy, you are perfectly competent, bordering on good, even. But you know I'm better. If you want, we can pretend it's 'cause I got a team and more resources. Either way, it'd be crazy to ignore my advice.
I absolutely, without apology, will admit that someone may have allegedly done so.
Not according to the recent Supreme Court case of bite versus me.
This is completely unethical. Why are we listening to this?
Fine, fine! Instead of a live stream, I'll get a recap from Cuddy 20 minutes later — thank you for saving America.
Yeah. I was really hoping for a different diagnosis — one that Kaufman hadn't already come up with. He just started a bone-marrow biopsy.
I don't. You do. Go to admitting. Find us a new case. [House takes his backpack and goes to his office. As soon as Masters leaves, he leans back into the conference room and whispers to get the guys’ attention.] Whff! Psst, psst! Whaa! Phfffft!
DDX.
No, we just did the fake one. Why do you think I let the truth fairy know about the bug? I was testing her. She failed. She's still a narc. Thiamine deficiency fits better than leukemia.
I had dinner with Arlene. I mixed her a gin and tonic. And I'd run out of the tonic, so I substituted sleeping pills. Next morning, she assumed the blackout was from the drinking. How many old ladies are used to passing out from boozing? The answer is the boozers. We're gonna have to slip her the thiamine pills.
[nods] Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood?
Treatment's very easy, safe. It's literally a few vitamin pills. It'll fix her heart, and it won't interfere with the biopsy Kaufman's running. [He places a bottle of pills on her desk.] Put 'em in an antacid bottle. Just tell her it's for stomach problems.
Of course. Absolutely. You'll ask. She'll deny. You'll push it. She'll get offended. You'll be exactly where you are now, except it'll be harder to treat. You've absolutely got to do that.
She just spent the last five years going south of the border down Mexico way.
Addicts lie.
And keep you out of it?
That means I was wrong about the thiamine deficiency.
True dat. It's actually looking more and more like leukemia.
So there's a bright side… Kaufman was wrong too.
DDX.
Lupus? We got fired from that case. We're moving on.
By the patient. This time by Cuddy, so it's real. She somehow realized that her completely unworkable system was completely unworkable. Okay, pop quiz, hot shots — I chose vegetable Stew for a reason. You got 60 seconds, no "hintsies." [He taps his wristwatch then mimes zipping his lip.]
Exactly. You're gonna have to— [Oops. He talked] Hey! [scoffs] You're good.
Really? You thought that case was interesting?
Not according to my sexual harassment seminar.
Congratulations, you can think exactly like a semi-competent internist. Kaufman's starting her on prednisone. But the heart problems were first.
It's usually a late sign.
Below the resolving threshold.
Check the wiretap. His I.D. guy's been putting the same argument to him. He can't convince him. You think I got a better shot?
We switch her meds. [Taub and Foreman are really shocked.] We get a solution of broad-spectrum antibiotics, stick it in an I.V. bag marked for prednisone. Kaufman can only be there a few times a day. Tell Arlene you're from the pharmacy, switch 'em out.
[loudly] It's hanging an I.V. bag!
[louder still] What risk? We know how he's treating her. We bugged the room.
[shouting] She's dying!
No. She said to keep her out of it, do what we need to do. Look, I know what I'm suggesting is completely screwed up. That's because this situation is completely screwed up. Do it, or you're fired.
Another pop quiz. How many idiot doctors does it take to switch an I.V.? The longer we wait, the more the prednisone is gonna kill her immune system. Forget playing pharmacist. Mom naps every afternoon. Wait by the room. When she falls asleep, get the sister out somehow.
You told me to keep you out of it, do what I needed to do. What the hell did you think that meant?
Only because you intentionally weren't thinking about it 'cause you don't want to make any tough decisions.
That's not a real question. Endocarditis fits better than the alternatives. [deep breath] We're having a little trouble hanging the right I.V. The fastest way is with you help.
Does Kaufman know what we did? That's good.
We push through this. It started in the heart. Endocarditis still fits. It's just got to be fungal. We have to switch Kaufman's antibiotics for amphotericin B.
I don't care about confusing the attending! I want this woman—
Which she already has, which will help us hide it.
[shouts] Well, then you shouldn't have let her fire me! [calmer] Look, all you have to do is switch the I.V.s again.
I'm right.
I'm kicking you out of your office. Yes, you. This is not her office yet. [Cuddy leaves. Masters looks scared. House crosses to sit behind the desk, looming over Masters in the process.] If you tell anyone, I will get you thrown out of med school, and I will destroy your career.
True… but I won't have to lie. Buried in your coma patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives.
You drew blood. And that's not just a screw-up. It's a criminal assault.
No. As you may recall… [He mimes zipping his lip again.]
[very quiet, very serious] Because this patient is the highest priority.
[to Masters] I think he's talking to you.
[to Masters] Happy?
You just killed her.
Actually, my mistakes started a little after that, when I agreed to your brilliant scheme to keep me on the case after she'd fired me off it.
Only 'cause you would have let her, like you did just now.
I don't know. I've never seen you try.
Here's what I've seen. She insults you, you complain to me. I drug her at dinner, you never let her know. We slip her medicine, happens behind her back. You never confront her… and it pisses me off.
She leaves, she dies. One day… maybe a week from now, maybe a year from now, you're gonna decide that the man sleeping next to you killed your mother. [He looms in] Get me my patient back.
Your heart's still weak from the infection. We'll hang an antifungal I.V. [He starts getting the I.V. bag ready]
Two days ago? I said that I didn't have a department to run, I was being sarcastic.
Right, because people who are talking can't tell if they're being sarcastic.
Deficit in the right parahippocampal gyrus, which means CNS involvement before the fever. [puts the I.V. bag down] I was wrong about the endocarditis.
I am.
The fever was hypothalamic. That means brain, heart, anemia, allergy. You hear that, what do you think?
You think heavy-metal toxicity.
She got better, then she got worse. She never stopped being poisoned.
You really want me to stop and explain? [He snaps on a glove, unsheathes a scalpel and makes an incision in Arlene’s hip. Arlene, who is still out of it, moans slightly.] There it is. Look at that.
Metallosis. Her artificial hip "weared and teared" way too much. It's cobalt poisoning. We need Chase to get an O.R. I'm gonna start chelation again.
Once again, you are unfired.
You sold me out even though you knew that you were gonna get thrown out of med school. That's just… kind of impressive.
When Cuddy was protecting me before, she was protecting a doctor. She's now protecting a boyfriend. The hospital's not gonna put up with that for long. So I need you to protect me from doing something Cuddy will regret. See you bright and late tomorrow.
 Picture a door.  Unlocked with the key of the mind.  Two medical cases, both more fascinating than the last.
 This is not a door to logical sense.  Also, shut up. (shining the light back onto his own face) Case number one.  33-year-old woman named…
 Something I can't remember.  You'll see the irony in a second.  Presenting with temporary paralysis, high CK levels, and a perfect memory.
 Perfectly perfect.  Hyperthymesia.  Complete recall of every moment of every day since puberty.  All 7,600,049 of them.  It's cool, huh?  One of only a handful of recorded cases.
 Obviously you're not suffering from the same condition 'cause you've already forgotten my dramatic voiceover.  There's a third symptom.
 Yeah, in the whole five documented cases.
 Or you could search her brain.  You know, where her memory lives.  Save the gas.  (to Taub and Foreman) You two check her home.  (to Chase and Masters) You two get a complete patient history.  We'll see who gets an answer first.
 Oh!  Yeah.  Thanks.
 The case of the 45-year-old doctor who just failed his pathology recertification exam and is going to lose his board certification and get fired.
 Normally, I'd let Darwinism run its course.  But Cuddy's in a big tizzy about her poster boy getting canned.  So, how are we gonna get the short guy off the short bus?
 Tutor it is.  Choose your poison.  Chase, if you prefer pounding Aussie beers and commiserating over the suckiness of divorce.  Masters, if you want nervous energy, flash cards, and obnoxious pieces of arcane trivia.  Foreman, if you need to be berated by a humorless hard-ass.
 Interesting.  You must be more worried than you look.
 I need a consult, Dr. Wilson.
 Who's Sarah?
 I need your medical opinion on what bar we're gonna hit for happy hour tonight to kick off the official end to your three-month pity party over Sam.
 Because of Sarah?
 Who's Sarah?  Wilson's friend.
 Or you're both lying to me.
 Nooo.
 Hello?
 In the parking garage, searching Wilson's car.
 I admit that's… impressively outside-the-box thinking.  (spotting something in the trunk) Hmm.
 No.  For a second I thought Wilson might have a drug problem.  Turns out it's much, much worse.
 You'll be waiting a long time since that's not what she has.  Her BP and respiratory rate are normal.  While you two were so busy being impressively outside the box, you missed the actual box.  Chase and Masters done yet?
 Hi.  I'm Dr. House.  You are not pooping.  Question is, are you also a klutz?
 What are you guessing for?  You've got a perfect memory.  I was told there'd be numbers, dates, fireworks.
 Let's go back to 2008.  How many trips, stumbles, falls did you have?
 This really works.  Cool.  How 'bout 2009?
 Even cooler.  Last year?
 If you add the constipation, it's early onset Parkinson's.  Give her a full neuro exam, and start her on levodopa.  (House leaves)
 An intervention.  (holding up the baggie he found in Wilson’s trunk) Exhibit A.  A baggie filled with nepeta cataria, also known as…
 If you mean your new junkie girlfriend, then yes.
 I don't think you appreciate the severity of your situation.  You are rapidly approaching an end-stage male spinsterism.
 That cat, that diabetic cat that you're shooting up with Insulin and buying dime bags of catnip for, that means you've given up on ever finding anyone.
 If I'm completely overreacting, why'd you lie to me?
 Its name's Sarah.  Cats aren't named that, women are.  What the Freud is that about?
 Masters, when you finally blossom into a woman, would you ever sleep with a man who had a cat?
 Wrong, the answer is no.  Slut.  Any of you ever had a cat? (they all nod “no”)    Any of you ever had sex? (they all nod “yes”)  I think, as your people say, quod erat demonstrandum.
 Curiosity.  (tossing the string on the table) Can we focus here?
 Run a stress test to confirm long QT.
 Drugs are never the answer.  If we want her heart to go crazy, there's something simpler and safer.  Use the sister.
 You lied to me.
 That's not the kind of putty tat he needs to be getting it from.  He needs a putty tat he can tap.
 After divorce number two, he fell into a committed relationship with a three-legged Siamese.  He stopped answering his phone, redecorated his place like Grey Gardens.  He wasn't able to come back to humanity until a window was left suspiciously and heroically open.  How that cat opened the window, I will never know.
 (as he leaves her office) I won't if you will.
 Because, while they're off running all these tests, you will be submitting the insurance forms.
 Exactly.  The Foreman department.  Of which you are the foreman, Foreman.  I know you got the time.  A little Wallaby told me that you recently vacated your post as Taub's savior.
 Consider the forms incentive.  Taub doesn't pass, he'll become a permanent part of your life.
 Don't think you can disgust me into pulling Foreman off you.  Pulse the patient with steroids for the autoimmune.  Start her on dialysis for the kidney failure.  Treat the Taub with insults and small slaps for the obstinacy, and start him on studying for the brain failure.  (House gets up and goes into his office)
 (removing his glasses) Paranoia is the first sign of toxoplasma gondii, the parasite linked to crazy cat lady disease.
 Maybe your subconscious is afraid that you're gonna die alone.  And it just comes out as gibberish and sneezing.  Prove that I'm overreacting.  Boys' night out.  Good Time Charlie's.  They just changed their slogan to, "where the trashiest ladies
But I never had a cat.  Why don't you pick me up at 8:00?  (Wilson leaves)
 Pulmonary edema doesn't give you hives.
 It can be.  If it was a really, really bad one.
 I have good news and bad news.  The good news is I was right about you having some autoimmune disease.  You're just allergic to the dialysis.
 Well, you figured out the bad news.
 I'm sure she's right.  Unlike everybody else in the world, her memory seems to let her keep a pure and objective view of people in relationships.  There's no petty
 Not necessarily.  Nadia's sister's not like her.  I'm sure she's got plenty of subjective emotions we can exploit.  Why don't you go channel your guilt, see if you can get her to cough up a kidney?
 Someone else didn't screw this up.
 You were just obeying orders.  Right?  Go fix this.
 Did the patient thank her sister?
 See if she will.
 If she's telling the truth.  She claims she objectively sees reality.  Weighing the good and bad in people.  If that's true, I don't care how many times her sister borrowed her scrunchie without asking, a free kidney ought to trump all the bad stuff.
 That means she sucks like the rest of us.
 Factor 5 leiden.  Easiest to treat if we're right.  Start her on heparin.  And ask for the thank you. (Chase nods and he and Masters leave)
 Too fat.  Too thin.  Too desperate.  Not desperate enough.  (to Wilson) Come on, you can insult them too.
 If you objectify them now, you'll feel more comfortable when you… tie them to a table in your basement later.  Or whatever.
 Whoa!  Too hot.
 Brains and boobs.  The mother lode.
 Girlfriend, that means she's into you.
 Hi, there.  Wilson, James Wilson.  I'm a doctor.  I'm hoping that's enough to close, because I'm also a social moron.  And I have a cat.
 Yeah, but is she interested?
 Bartender!  Champagne for everyone!
 Do you know if that… O.R. nurse that Wilson liked ever broke up with her boyfriend?
 I'm putting together a second string in case things don't go well with the well-breasted barista.
 He's not supposed to be alone.
 Have you met me?
 (answering the phone) Yeah.
 So then the question becomes, will the sister show up at the funeral?
 Nobody's perfect.  What else?  (None of them answer) Come on, the woman has all the information we need.  She's a bottomless diagnostic library.
 Hey.  How many puzzles?
 Do a peripheral blood smear.  Look for acanthocytes.  I'll be right in.
 Remember me?  Just kidding. (He and Chase enter the room) So… jigsaw puzzles.
 You ever left one unfinished?
 Speaking of…
 More important question is, why are you?
 It's a habit that compels you in an obsessive way, that's so bad, it's a disorder.
 So what we thought was a gift… is just you literally obsessing over your own life.
 Memory was just a symptom of a symptom of a larger disease.  You have McLeod syndrome.  It's a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, the blood.  And can cause… (He reaches for her cup again, but she stops him before he can move it) OCD.
 If it's any solace, everybody dies alone.  (Nadia glares at him) It probably isn't.
 Hey.
 Those are for Sarah.
 Poi— you and your paranoia.  Now, if you'll excuse me…
 I really should find a better place to store my ragweed.
 So…  I wanna hear all the dirty, dairy-specific details of your night with java the slut.
 I'll give you ten days.
 Ooh!
Muahahahaaaaahhh [His head pops out from under the bed. He is grinning.] Gotcha.
Set an alarm and everything.
God, I hope not. [She smiles and joins him on the floor, draping across his chest as they kiss.] Now that we're down here…
Seriously?
I'll wait. I brought a book. [He reaches under the bed, pulls out a book and starts to read.] I didn't know what time your alarm was set for.
You know, you can rent this space out down here. In Japan, that would be like a deluxe—
You're my girlfriend. I'm being supportive.
Well, given that there's almost certainly nothing wrong with you, and my patient definitely has something wrong with him—
'Fraid not. He's… [House is stumped] Chase.
See? Serious.
But it is a good-time adjacent. [to the team] Feed the kid a camera. Check his gut for angiodysplasia.
[confidentially to the urologist] Hey, I'm, uh, I'm missing a watch. So can you keep your eyes open while—
You are very pleased with yourself, aren't you?
[to Taub] Run a lead level and push 5 liters IV fluid.
Cystoscopy was clean. Cytopathology was normal.
[tosses them on the desk] I don't. If I did, I'd know you were fine.
Come on. Your hypochondriac mom had a brush with mortality last month, and it's understandable that you're worrying more than usual, worrying that you might turn into her.
Meet me in the cafeteria in ten. There'll be a corn dog with your name on it. I mean an actual corn dog. They fixed the deep fryer.
Oh, don't do that!
I'm not talking to you. [He was talking to the computer.]
Damn!
Not talking to you!
She's fine. She's just too stupid to accept it. Start him on nafcillin for staph.
You're freaking out because of one ultrasound performed by an incompetent Bonobo monkey.
[shrill] Calling a lawyer, drafting a will! [She gives him a look.] Okay. I-I… hacked into your online schedule. Look, tests always show something. A mass in your kidney could be a complex cyst. It could be benign.
But you're doing it now because you think you're sick. The freaking out can at least wait until after the biopsy this afternoon.
For the Dean of Medicine, the first opening in the schedule is… Oh, look! Now. [He turns his arm as if he were showing her a watch even though he isn’t wearing one.]
Actually, it is.
[quietly] Good point. [He leaves.]
[from the other room] That better be her!
I don't know why you're here, but I didn't do it.
Nope. But since her mom died, she's my favorite tax write-off. Officer, you have my word it won't happen again. [The policeman walks out.] 'Cause next time… [House flips the door closed] she won't get caught!
Looks like peeing blood is the new black.
Probably some kinda mass.
Makes sense. But doesn't rule out a mass.
Mass doesn't have to be cancer. Could be renal hematoma.
It's probably just a complex cyst or angiomyolipoma.
If it were heroin, he'd be going through withdrawal. Antiphospholipid syndrome's a better fit. Start the patient on plasmapheresis.
Have I ever said no to that question?
What are you doing here?
Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour. You should be keeping her company.
Three — I hate the smell of death.
I'm talking about our relationship. She needs support and comfort, both things that I famously suck at. This will inevitably lead to—
I'm not gonna act like there's a crisis before we know there is one. There's no proof there's anything wrong with her.
[thinks this over and nods] You're right.
Chase? How'd it go with Cuddy? Chase?
Good thing I brought my ax cane.
I'm coming!
It looks like we got company.
[shouting] No!
Ah…
I was sleeping. What could go wrong?
And a complete absence of any record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy. She must have put it under a false name so I couldn't rush the results.
There's no patient file created in the last two days for anyone having that procedure.
Hands off. She's mine.
How sweet. I'm not worried. I just wanna get the results so she can stop worrying.
Do an angiogram. You two go to pathology and look at Cuddy's slides.
I guess you're gonna have to look at them all.
Pie-eating contest.
Yeah. I get it. She needs artificial support for an artificial problem. She's fine.
We don't know that. [Masters knocks on the open door and enters.] Hey! Eating pie in here.
He's referring to the pie.
Means they'll have to remove the mass to know if it's cancer or not.
[calling from the living room] Can we order pizza? There's nothing in the fridge. At least not anymore. What's happening with the patient?
You keep talking like Wilson, your face will freeze like that.
Just in time. Pot roast is ready.
I cured all my patients, so I came home to spend time with Rachel.
We've been studying together. [Fake aside, out of the corner of his mouth to Rachel] It was supposed to be a surprise.
I think Rachel deserves a treat. [He pulls a lollipop out of his apron pocket.]
Girl can dream.
Yeah. [Foreman sees the look on his face and stops shooting video monsters.] Okay. [He hangs up.]
Imaging shows enhancing masses across multiple lobes of Cuddy's lungs.
She's dead.
I got a great idea where we should go.
You're gonna love it. Australia's Finest. There's a great karaoke bar in Newark—
They got every — every song by every Aussie artist. Midnight Oil, Men at Work, Olivia Newton John.
And the barbecue shrimp is amazing.
Hot and salty and delicious. [He pulls a candy bar out of his pocket and starts to eat it. She stares at it.] Talking about food made me hungry.
Means you're stressed at work. All dream symbols mean you're stressed at work. Or castration anxiety.
I can do better. [They push themselves to stand, leaning against the wall.]
I should have been here. Sorry.
If you don't make it, I won't sleep with anyone for at least a month.
Bitch.
House:
Hi.
[puts down the journal] Guess who doesn't have cancer? Me. Also you. Actually, you for sure. Me…
Your tumor was benign. An oncocytoma. They cut it out. You'll be fine.
Once they ruled out cancer, I remembered that your mom was allergic to antibiotics. So I had them test your blood, and your IGE levels were through the roof. Because the lung masses were an allergic reaction. So now you're off the antibiotics, your lungs should clear right up. [she smiles] I brought you something. [He fishes a small, clear jar from his pocket.] Say hello to your tumor.
Take him off the meds. He's got a staph infection.
Bacteria already in his system responded. But once a door's been busted open, more just keep coming.
For the cheap seats, an abscess is a gooey little cream puff of infection. Probably burst when your little pride and homicidal joy took a hard foul.
[also ashamed. He can’t look her in the eyes.] How did you know?
It was a one-time thing.
I was scared because I thought my girlfriend might die.
As opposed to everyone else in the world who goes looking for pain like it's buried treasure?
I ca–I came to be with you.
I wanted to be.
[imploring] I can do better.
No. No, no, no. Don't. Don't.
Don't. Please don't.
I'm fine.
I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me.
And that I'm back on Vicodin.
Well, I'm not fine as in "fine," but I'm fine as in "you don't have to worry about me."
Because I'm going to be fine as in "fine" very soon.
My leg hurts.
It's gotten worse.
Worse is worse. Pain doesn't discriminate. Neither do the pills. The Vicodin and the five-star pampering that I'm gonna get over the next few days should be enough to get me through it.
Nothing is either as bad or as good as we think it is at the time. That's why T.O. mocks his opponents immediately after scoring. He doesn't wait till his friend shows up the next day to tell him to deal with it. [There’s a knock on the door.] Two weeks from now, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, my life will be back to its usual level of crappiness. Till then, the only real issue is how much I'm gonna spend on hotel charges.
Do I have to count the strawberries?
[points to Wilson] After he and I have sex, I'm gonna slit his throat and then disembowel him in the bathtub.
Why didn't I meet you six months ago? [He hands Carnell the money.]
[biting a strawberry] Eat fast. We're expecting company.
What do you think he meant by "anything"?
I know it's a figure of speech, to underline the "anything."
Already scheduled.
[looks at Wilson] I'm not an idiot. I know I need help.
I know.
Yeah. Baby steps.
Morons.
Whoa. Wait a second. The acoustics in here are beautiful. [loudly, echoing] Morons! [Cut to hotel bathroom. House sharing a bubble bath with a beautiful brunette who faces him in the tub.] You say it.
Something Carnell got me.
Great theory. It's a ridiculous test. You can't give a standard balance test to a champion bull rider. [While he is talking, he is holding the hooker’s foot, toes poised to enter his mouth.] If you're gonna test Superman's strength, you need a bigger barbell. Find one, make him lift it, then call me and tell me how high it got. [He leans to the side of the tub to talk directly into the phone.] And tell Cuddy that spying is for cowards.
Can you pass me the, um…
What took you so long?
Doesn't answer the question.
Apology accepted.
[indulgently] Oh, that's so cute. You're fighting over who's in charge.
Who's in charge?
Let me rephrase. Who's your daddy?
Those my only two choices? Or can I also point out the self-pity coming from you? You're just annoyed because when your relationship ended, no one gave a crap, including you.
And, Chase, stop screwing with Foreman. [Chase, whose hands are almost covering his mouth, grins broadly.] And, Foreman, no. Till the telephone gets uninvented, no one in that room needs more authority than I give them, and right now I give you the authority to scope his GI tract and biopsy his parotid. And you can pick up the phone.
I am not on Vicodin. [He swallows a Vicodin.] Do the tests. I have to see a man about a hurdy-gurdy.
Making it, as they say, as tough to find as a hooker who can play the hurdy-gurdy.
It's an expression. Means it's tough, but apparently it can be done.
You have eyes.
Obviously.
Only if you want to see what's wrong with him. [He hangs up.] Do you know Free Bird?
It's a mass… [He’s in bed.] And then it's not.
Team, meet Duke.
Anke? How'd I get Duke?
As in eaten? Ever? This year?
All but one. She did my taxes. On the other hand, tapeworm that burrowed
Detached cyst?
Okay, so how did you shoot down intermittently swollen lymph node?
Sounds good.
It's probably a push. I'm just trying to get you out of here, because underneath this sheet, [confidentially] stuff is going on.
Just pick a spot and stick a needle in it.
That is a nice bow.
Put it on my tab. Let's say we take it up a notch. [He tosses Carnell an apple.]
You don't trust me?
And we have a gamer.
I like you, Carnell. Don't ruin it. [He turns on the phone.] Stinky feet can point to diabetes, athlete's foot, or gangrene… Pick one.
Don't do that, Carnell. They might get the idea that I'm shooting at a hooker. [He takes aim. The hooker waits. He lowers the bow as he gets an idea.] Fungal infection can cause ulceration between the toes and bleeding could be from recurring abscesses that appear to be recurring masses.
[aiming and pulling back on the bowstring] No, it'll just feel like it's ripping him in two, which is much better.
Oops. [The team, listening, looks puzzled] Got to go.
Why?
She doesn't look hurt.
Yes, we did.
Okay. Go get me, uh, general Patton's colt 45. [The door opens] The one with the two notches.
I'm fine.
What an ego. You think you're some sort of emotional paragon? You're my rock?
At least I have the good sense not to marry every woman I fall into bed with. Maybe you should move in with me.
[getting annoyed] I prefer you to stop talking about this.
[loudly] Leave me alone!
So I have no choice? Fine. Unless… unless… [He has a revelation.] Yes, I do. I do have legs. [He stands.] I see you didn't factor those into your brilliant plan. [House takes his drink and leaves.]
If the infection's not in his heart, then it's in his brain. You're in my sun. Do a CT.
So get rid of them.
[sits up, supporting his leg] And not removing the plate will be like leaving the egg out to rot.
What if the one symptom that hasn't disappeared was never actually there? Any delays when he answers questions? [Masters nods] He doesn't have partial hearing loss. He's missing moments. He reported having something like a complex partial seizure during a bull ride. Said it hasn't happened since, but what if he's wrong? What if the infection in the brain is causing it to happen all the time?
I didn't say it was a seizure. I said it was something like a seizure.
It won't. It's just gonna prove that we need to cut into your skull, which is gonna be kind of dangerous. So you've got a real incentive to sing like an angel.
It can't compensate if there's a preset rhythm. [He sets a metronome on the bed tray.] One, two, three.
[unenthusiastically] Yeah.
I hate when you do that. You respond to what you think I'm thinking, because you think that I think like you do. It's insulting and annoying.
It's understandable. You're scared because you think I'm falling apart, and you're trying to convince yourself that you're overreacting.
[answering] Yeah.
Well, that sucks. Now we have to blow up his heart.
'Cause we're looking the wrong way. [Holds up the straw.] There's an imperfection. How do you find where?
You suck. Feel free to interpret that both ways. Suck on the straw, see where the drink leaks.
If we don't rip it, the damage from the infection will, probably not when he's got his chest open in an O.R. where it can be repaired inside the 60 seconds it'll take him to bleed to death.
Now if you don't mind… get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.
Hey. We think you have a Bartonella infection, which caused a mycotic aneurysm in your aortic wall. We need to find it, which means we need to blow up your heart. And, yes, I'm as serious as a heart attack. We're going to increase your blood pressure until the weak spot in your aortic wall explodes. Hopefully we'll be able to fix it before you bleed to death. Any questions?
Really? You don't even want to know if you'll be able to go back to bull riding?
[puzzled] Thought you loved those eight seconds.
[calm and deliberate] Since I didn't ask, I wasn't expecting you to say anything at all.
[mirthless laugh] Really? No reason? None at all? I'm just planning on cracking open his chest, blowing up his heart, what, to pad his bill? [scornful] Or you think that since you broke my heart I want to break his.
You're right. I am. But my damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment is still better than yours or any other doctor in this hospital, and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life. So you can either have security arrest me and my team, or you can get the hell out of my way.
[contemptuous] Annnnnd… she caves.
I take it you ratted me out to Cuddy.
No, you don't. [He hits the intercom button with his cane.] Come on. I got a squash game at 2:00. Let's give this cowboy a ride.
You're right. Let's make damn sure we don't damage his toes while we blow up his heart.
Not yet.
[over the intercom] I heard you.
Double scotch. Doubled.
No.
Cannonball!
[standing in the pool, surrounded] What do you do when you win?
What do you do when you lose?
 First person to offer me an interesting case gets to ride her… single or double-team.  (Masters looks uncomfortable) My scooter, which, now said out loud, sounds even more inappropriate. (He hands his sunglasses to Dominika)
 Let me guess… diagnosis was fire.
 Cool.  Dysosmia… could be anything from an environmental factor to an early sign of a degenerative brain disease.  (taking the patient file from Masters) Smells like a winner.  Okay, (speaking to Taub) you and Chase go check out the park where they found him.  (to Masters and Foreman) You two load him up with Prednisone, give him an odor I.D. test.  If he's still mistaking his body odors for candy, the problem's definitely in his brain.  Also, find out what else he's lying about… (throwing the file down onto the table) Since I'm assuming "Ferris Bueller" is not his real name. (he starts up the Segway again)
 Before I forget, I want you to meet Dominika.  She's about to become a permanent member of Team House.
 Me.  We're getting married on Friday.  (to Dominika) Mount up!
 Living on the edge, baby doll!
 Speaking of things, (He looks through the stack of invitations he is carrying) I'm having one on Friday.  If you want to drop by, we'd love to have you.  (He hands an invitation to Cuddy) No pressure.
 So I am.  Perhaps you're not familiar with New Jersey handicap ordinances.
 For some reason, my leg's been hurting a lot this week.
 Fine.  I'll return it.
 But I’ll have to walk it out of here.
 I hear a strange voice.
 I know we said no secrets, but I think I need to take this alone, honey bunny.
 Yeah, it's the classic "You dumped me, so I'm gonna get married a week later" ruse.  'Cause not only is she that stupid, but apparently I'm that stupid.
 It doesn't.  But you proved that yourself years ago.
 Only one theory left… I am.  Dominika needs a green card.
 (opening the folder) Have you seen me practice medicine?  You know how much it costs to have a live-in maid, personal assistant, cook, massage therapist, whore?  I do.  She's willing to work four days a week for free.  It's gonna save me about $33,000.
 All I have to do is say two stupid words… "I do."
 (putting his feet up on the desk) Iron-clad prenup… We go our separate ways.  Your stunned look, I take it, is your way of saying, "Brilliant idea, House."
 He also enjoys vitamin H.  The kid's a junkie.
 His hair wasn't.  I had it tested… (He eats one of the cucumber slices) 'Cause unlike Santa and the Easter Bunny, homeless, non-mentally ill 20-somethings without drug problems don't exist.  He was a heavy user sometime in the last five months.
 He really puts the "mani" in the "pedi."
 Not usually.  But this guy's been sleeping on a bed of dog poop.  I wouldn't be surprised if he's got six different symptoms for six different reasons.
 Vitamin O.D. makes sense, and it's easier to treat.  Give him Tocopherol and zinc supplements for the excess vitamin A.  If we're right… he could go homeless tomorrow.
 (to Dominika) See what happens when women don't have to serve men to stay in the country?  The get all uppity.  This is why we invented green cards.  (to Masters) Go X-ray the guy's abdomen, if it'll make you feel all equal.  (Masters leaves)
 I need a favor.  (tossing a folder on her desk) I want to add my fiancee's name to my health insurance a few days early.  She wants to get a tooth capped before the big day. (He spins around on the Segway)
 I agree. (spinning around again) I think she looks beautiful the way she is.  Oh, no, wait.  You're not signing that for moral reasons?
 You're declaring yourself the sole arbiter of true love?  'Cause you covered Taub's wife for years.
 (calling out to Dominika in Russian) Voydi moya malishka (“Come in my baby.”)
 She wanted me to bribe you, like they do back in the old country.  (to Dominika) Tell her what I said.
 Yeah, I just get teary-eyed every time I hear her say that.  She brought you a gift.
 Almond kulich… How can you say no to that?
 Yes.
 North, Miss Teschmacher!  (Eve Teschmacher was Lex Luthor’s assistant in the first two Superman movies)
 Which is kind of surprising for a homeless junkie living in a park.
 Once an addict, always an addict.
 Doubt it.  You're the main reason I'm on the stuff.  We could be looking at fungal masses hanging off the walls of his colon.  Start him on Amphotericin "B" tonight, and in the morning, run a scope up where the sun don't shine, see if you can find any truffles.
 I'll start when you decide what the symptoms are and give me some theories.
 But the patient doesn't… no fever.
 Negative reinforcement.
 Good.  MRI his head, find it.
 (to Dominika) Hey, hey.
 Except it's not.  I've seen MRI imagery like that in schizophrenics.  (back to the game) Three serving two.
 It's "face."
 Close enough.  The E.R. docs missed it, because he didn't present with major symptoms yet.  We're seeing it in its infancy.
 I'd love to, but I got four million other crazy people ahead of him on my to-do list, along with milk.
 No, I don't.
 She's dying of guilt and feels horrible for dumping me.  It's great.  I mean, not the dumping part, but the part where she'll now let me do whatever I want.
 That's not true.  I got plenty of goals. (taking off his glasses) One of them is a 60-inch flat screen right there.  (He nods toward the wall in front of his desk)
 Ahoy there, me hearties!  Permission to come aboard.
 It's not.  He's on Clozapine.  He'd be getting better, not worse.
 Don't make me take my shoe off!
 Or cortical-based ganglionic degeneration or Huntington's or any one of a dozen other genetic diseases.
 If we're gonna test for them all, it'll take weeks.  I'm not canceling my honeymoon to treat this kid.
 Most are.
 So we cheat.  Since it's genetic, daddy or mommy's got it too.  They're either sick or dead.
 He's a homeless ex-junkie.  Are you telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him?  Green light!  (House floors the accelerator, throwing everyone back against their seats)
 Cuddy got it for me.  And now I'm drafting a request for a study into the effects of caffeine involving an Italian espresso machine and a massage chair, so make it quick.
 Well done.
 The "well done" was for making it quick.  Now I'm gonna have to take that back.
 And the reason you're continuing to talk instead of driving there?
 You are genuinely upset at being mockingly snubbed by a mock wedding?
 She is.  (Dominika puts some tools on the desk) Oh, my God!  W-what did you think she was doing?  She's just installing the cable.  (Taub leaves as House calls out after him) That's not a euphemism!
 Shhh!
 Test.
 The important question is, who are you?  Danny Jennings is dead, which means that Danny Jennings has no pulse.  You, on the other hand… do.  Ergo, you are not Danny Jennings.  (House leans his cane against the bed) Or I did the test wrong.  So why don't you cut the crap and tell me your real name.
 Hiding your identity… Well, either you're a criminal or a superhero.
 Awesome.  What color is my underwear?
 No problem.  I just need your father's name.
 Care to tell me why?
 You're a big boy now.  You still think he can hurt you?
 Well, luckily for you, we don't need daddy to figure that one out.
 Cerebellar ataxia.
 (pushing the elevator button) The guy whiffed twice trying to pick up a cup right in front of him.  That plus everything else…
 Means that we have whittled our list of genetic diseases… (He swallows the pills) All the way down to one… Early-onset Parkinson's.
 You could lie.  I'm fine with that.  But you'll probably both feel better if you give him Levodopa and confirm with DNA tests.
 What, you want the fish instead of the chicken?
 Oh, so… you've decided to take a moral stand.
 You're right.  I think I saw Blue the janitor passed out in one of the pews last week.
 Well, where are we gonna go?  We got caterers staging everything downstairs as we speak.  We've got floral arrangements, place settings… Other wedding-y stuff.
 I sent out the invitations.  People are coming here.
 What are we missing?
 Why?
 Yeah, but why so fast?  He had dysosmia for a couple months, never even came here to get it treated.  He's just a random burn victim.  We get him, boom, he's got tunnel vision, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and now cardiomyopathy.  What's different here than, say, living in a filthy state park?
 Stop that man!  (the worker pauses) I need the meal card for the patient in 243.  (House hangs his cane on the cart and leafs through the list of Danny’s meals) He's eating healthy… because he can.  Most of the meals in here are vegetarian.  (He hands the meal record book back to the worker and takes his cane off of the cart)  Adult Refsum disease… Fits all the symptoms.  His body can't process the phytanic acid and chlorophyll.  It's his healthy diet of green vegetables that's killing him.
 Run him through a plasmapheresis treatment to remove the excess phytanic acid from his blood.  Confirm with gene testing.  Okay, I gotta go get married.
 Yep.
 I like you too.
 I can't.
 I never sleep with married women.  I'm going to bed.  You can take the couch.
[loudly, from his office] You'd lie too if you bottomed out, ended up in… drug rehab. [He takes some pills.]
Loved ones are always the last to know. Loved ones and robotic, estranged ex-boyfriends. Our patient is Kendall Pearson. 16-year-old aspiring pirate.
Collapsed yesterday during a practice run. Luckily for us, cameras were there. [He hits a button on the remote and an overhead shot of a sailboat with one person on deck comes on the TV.] Corporate sponsors want us to check that's she seaworthy before the clock strikes "you're too old to set a record." Gives us three days. [to Masters] You've still only got one, right?
Pulse and BP were normal at the time of the rescue. It's not dehydration. What about your internship? You sign up this morning?
Nice. Blood draws every 15 minutes for four hours. Let's track her cortisol. Masters, there's no hurry. There's no wrong choices. At least, that's what they tell people who make crappy choices.
[Sighs] You know, a blacksmith who spends this much time hammering out a new blade from raw Jell-O… gets curious about who ends up wielding it.
Thirteen, why don't you take Masters to do the blood draws. You can remind her about all the perks of working for me.
Save the attitude for someone who didn't just get you your medical license back. Price you pay.
No, there isn't.
Relax. She's completely honest, but also completely boring. Watch this. Don't tell anyone.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to do one of those? You should've spoken up. You want the job or not?
Great. My department has a slightly different procedure log.
Do you know how to do an LP?
Do you know how to do nine LPs and say it was ten? It's time to grow up. Turn that in, the job's yours. [Her pager beeps] Stop staring blankly and go. No doubt something horrible has just happened to our patient.
Down here! [House is by the elevators. He’s looking at the floor and taking baby steps.] Loss of consciousness plus she's slowly turning blue. Can we rule out magical gum?
That clever bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp.
Hello? The quietest and calmest of all the chickens.
Cerebral vasospasm makes sense. Take Thirteen. Give the patient a calcium channel blocker infusion in the basilar artery. [He sees the log in Masters’ hands.] Masters. I thought you were going to turn that in.
You're not busy now. [Standoff. She leaves.] Bawwwwwwk bawk.
On your way to do that, did you happen to stop and give Thirteen an LP? Thirteen's stiff gate, small pupils, and the raging headache she's hiding gave you away.
No. Not liking it is fine. Not doing what you don't like makes you an eight-year-old. Wastes your potential. [He sits at his computer and starts typing.]
That's the last thing I want. 'Cause then neither one of us would be exceptional.
Not anymore.
No, you can't. 'Cause I'm not gonna let you. Internship's gone. It's time for Masters to say good-bye. Enjoy being a surgeon. You'll be fine.
[from the observation deck.] Don't you have your own surgery?
You lied. Small one. But it's a gateway lie.
Another lie. You care about being exceptional.
A third lie. Welcome to the slippery slope.
When is a calcified pineal gland not a calcified pineal gland? I realize, technically, it's never, but—
You had me at "I had to pee." But Thirteen's right. Start her on three fold immunosuppressants. Masters, if you want to fight me on this, fill out a consult form so you can stick around. Welcome back.
You got really good at this lying thing.
You want yours extra crispy or original recipe?
No, you're not. Case is over. You're back to surgery. [He casts off. The lure lands at Masters’ feet.] And fetch. [The dog runs to grab it.] Oh, that's a good boy. Oh, that's a good boy. Hey, good boy.
[reeling the lure back in] Sign on the door says I'm a diagnostician. Cool diagnosis means I'm finished.
[casting off again] Pretty sure the law of the land states that everyone has the right to be an idiot. [The dog is staring intently at the lure. He starts to edge toward it.] Uh! [The dog stops.] I think it's the second amendment. Fetch! [The dog bounds after the lure.] Bring it here, boy. Who's a good boy?
[reeling the lure in] Yeah. 'Cause they faced the truth.
I'm fine with that. I wanted a diagnosis. I got it. What do you want?
Break the rules.
So coloring inside the lines is more important to you than saving this girl's life? I was wrong about one thing, you are not exceptional. [casts off again] And fetch! Ho ho ho. Oh, that's a good boy. Good boy. Good boy.
[unseen, from the hallway] Fetch!
Someone has got their pouty face on.
Good.
I don't want to know the specifics. Might be called to testify.
You were right.
And you're following me to ask how I break the rules and maintain my rosy demeanor.
Well, you can't always get what you want. [Wilson opens the door and House hands him a twenty.] To the victor of the spoils. Your bird recover okay?
Surgery?
Nothing will ever be simple again.
Thirsty. Side effect of a new antihistamine I'm on.
Hmm, intriguing.
Got some questions about whether Thirteen really believes in karma or just wants to. As for the patient, it's not gonna be easy to break into her office. Might want to start with her home.
Sure. Go ahead.
I am definitely interested. Could be a tumor. Could be a CNS bleed. What do you do when you got two interesting puzzles?
Bet's off. Fight was fixed. [Wilson opens his arms wide in “what are you talking about?” fashion.] That punch barely touched him.
Speed beats power… unless speed has been paid to speedily take a dive.
We bet on a sporting event. That was not sporting. Less than 30 seconds. That was barely even event-y.
Yeah, well, you can take that to your grave. You're not taking my 50 bucks.
So, two puzzles. Tie goes to the one that costs me money. [He grabs his cane and heads for the door.] Keep each other posted.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm not here to judge. You did what was best for you and I got no problem with that.
Or what? You're suddenly gonna fall down? Listen. I got a problem. A guy who knows absolutely nothing about boxing, because of you now thinks he does. You can imagine the potential ramifications. I need you to get on the phone with him and tell him you took a dive.
Take a picture of you to prove that it was really you and we're done. Just enough to convince him. Not enough to get you in any trouble.
Yeah. That story's getting boring. Look, I'm not from the commission. I'm not some bookie. I'm a doctor. This is my I.D.
But you were the better fighter. That last punch barely touched you.
Ha! [slams door] Proof.
Look at his pupils. He has anisocoria, which, given his age, the adrenaline surge of the fight, the fact that he's still alive means he was tachycardic. He has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
If he's physically unable to continue because of a preexisting illness, then it's technically a "no contest," which means all bets are off.
Actually, it would, if you were right.
Désolé, je ne parle pas anglais. [Sorry, I don’t speak English.]
Great. I'm a guy who doesn't care.
Oh, you thought I didn't know who Wendy Lee was? Yeah, makes sense. I'm not good at names. Did Dr. Fortune tell you that?
See, this is what I don't care about. [The elevator arrives. House gets in and pushes a button.] I don't care who cares about her. Used to care about her. Either one you falls down dead, you can drop me a note.
You screwed up in the lab and accidentally spilled some bomb on her?
Apparently our mad scientist is also a slutty scientist whose milkshakes got all the nerds in the yard fighting over her.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were still judging her.
You know what else wouldn't hurt? This case is getting interesting. Let's add a little danger.
One normal EKG does not a healthy person make.
Oh, you make me so sad. Don't talk like that.
Kill me for loving my patients. It's just what I do.
Hey, stop. Stop! [Foley turns around] Look, my–my leg hurts. Okay? Just talk to me for a moment. [House holds his leg as he sits on one of the benches in the hall. Foley stands in front of him.] You don't have to be a loser.
Whatever's wrong with you, it's real. Sick is good. Sick means it can get better. You cold get better. And I don't mean healthier. I mean… maybe you don't have to suck.
What looks like Wolff-Parkinson-White but isn't?
So was his. That's why I said "looks like." As in similar to, but not the same.
Who's the real bad guy here? The guy who doesn't care enough to help or the four guys who are not competent enough to help? He works out too much, gets pounded too much, and not in the romantic way. His pupils—
Your patient? No. Plenty of time to save her life after we save my money.
[lifting his head] Although…
Great news! You have an underlying neurological condition, which together with your heart—
Yeah, I also said I would get you your career back. But it doesn't seem to matter since you've so clearly been handed the golden spit bucket. [Foley glares slightly at him.] Sympathetic overdrive. It's a medical term. So is "great news." Of course, if you prefer wallowing… [Foley turns away from him. House follows.] All you need is a chin. And a heart, apparently. Then you can go back to being the guy who won 20 of his first 20 instead of the guy who lost 5 of his last 5. Although, technically, I count the last one as a "no contest."
I'm a doctor. I don't tell a fat guy to lay off bacon for less than 300. [Foley almost laughs.] This is about dignity for both of us. Give me your arm. [He hangs his cane on a piece of equipment and pulls something from his pocket.] Give me your arm.
Don't worry. It's just epinephrine.
In the wrong hands, very. So… yeah, sort of. This will only take a few seconds. [He checks the pulse in Foley’s neck.] And… you are tachycardic.
We combine the increased heart rate with chest trauma by applying a little sweet science to the science. Don't worry. I'll–I'll explain more when you wake up. Now, the punch that supposedly knocked you out looked like it was thrown by an old cripple. Kind of like this.
Three, two, one. [He waits but nothing happens.] Huh. Seem to be older and more crippled than I thought. [He punches Foley again.]
Doesn't make sense. Maybe if I—
How did you get in here?
Pain has been getting worse. I figured if I upped the Vicodin any more, I'd end up back in a rubber room, so this seemed like the smarter choice.
You drove all the way over here to break in and call me an idiot?
Oh, that makes more sense.
Even more logical.
There is another theory. [He picks up a report from a table and hands it to her.] Compound CS-804. It's an experimental drug that's supposed to regrow muscle.
It's groundbreaking. Huge success.
Well, they got four legs. Think how fast it should work on one.
"Great" is a little vague.
Have you done maximum tolerated dose studies?
But if it's worthy of the preface "obviously," then obviously it only needs to be explained to idiots. Do I look like an idiot? [Riggin looks offended.] Sorry. Cranky. What I meant to say was: Why don't scientists have groupies? 'Cause I'd do you right now if society wasn't telling me that you're just an underpaid dork.
Leg hurts. Would you mind getting me a coffee?
It will prevent me from walking to get the coffee.
[opening the door] That's unfair. 'Cause at one point, even Vicodin was an experimental drug. I have to go.
I'm going to do my job.
[turning back into the living room] I'll give you two minutes. But first, I'm gonna tell you that I'm off the drugs and you'll feel silly 'cause you've got nothing to say for two minutes.
Because they don't work.
Because they come in banana flavor. You know the answer.
I think that my life will be somewhat better if part of my life, specifically my leg, is somewhat better.
And you're here to tell me that no matter how depressed I may be, it's not enough.
[standing and walking past Wilson] I hate that word. I have to go now. Actually, I don't, but it would be rude to walk out without saying anything.
[leaning out the window] You need a drink.
That wasn't a question. You really do need a drink.
You're not going to explode. You're just gonna have a seizure, which will prove that your kidneys are not working, which will also prove that they weren't working Saturday night. That's why a glancing body blow sent your blood pressure into the toilet and you onto the canvas.
Six.
[looking in the trunk] Eight. It's not an exact science.
You're an idiot. [Foley looks understandably angry.] No, you're not gonna hit me… 'Cause somewhere deep in that way-too-thin skull of yours you know that you're full of crap. That's why you stopped jogging for me. That's why you drank eight bottles. Because even though you want to think that I'm wrong 'cause it's simpler, you also desperately want me to be right. I'm only an ass for building your hopes up if I'm wrong. [hands Foley another full bottle] Last one.
Anything else you want to say?
Anything else?
Nothing to talk about. That was my point.
Well, whose fault is that? Give me another scotch.
This 'cause I'm black? 'Cause I'm not, so…
Look, you can't get me drunk and then give me crap for being drunk. That's like dumping someone and then giving them crap for being upset. That's just not decent. Let me explain why people come here. [He lurches over to the bar.] They come here to drink. Which causes us to ask, why do people drink? Hmm? Is it sustenance? [He grabs a guy’s bottle of beer and reads the label.] No. Is it taste? [He takes a swig of the guy’s beer.] No.
Is it the company of stout-hearted men? I don't think so. Is it killing pain? Yes. [looks at the bottle again.] Seven and a half percent life duller. That's the business you're in. You're in the "screw the world" business. You're in the "reality sucks and fantasy temporarily appears to not suck" business.
No.
Have you no pride? Either serving me is a good idea or it's a bad idea. Shutting me up is a crappy reason for compromising what you believe.
Am I gonna have to hit him?
But what if it's the right thing to do? Compromise is never the answer. [He turns to Fellow Patron, who is sitting on the side of the bar, and gets into a boxing stance.] Stand up. I will allow you to throw the first punch.
Just as well, 'cause I was lying.
Training for my big fight. Just need you to—
That's your specialty.
Three, two… [Foley starts to demonstrate but falls over, unconscious.] What a lovely day.
Ahem! [Wilson looks up.] What's this? [House enters] A palm. Hmm, useful for many things. Slapping, greasing, probably some other applications too. Right now it's ready for $50 and humiliation.
He wasn't knocked out by the punch. He was knocked out by the clinch before the punch. Took a shot to the back of the neck. More specifically, to an abnormal growth of nerves caused by a glomus tumor. Kind of like a built-in taser. Sent a massive shock to his entire body, shut everything down.
Oh, you are not gonna be like that, 'cause you got a lot more posters here.
Oh, no. He needs surgery. He's never gonna fight again.
Better than okay.
 Look at how much fun she's having.
 So do I.
 I was going for the sympathy discount.  Been taking some experimental medicine.
 You want proof?
 Okay, this amp stack weighs way more than you do.
 See?  Now, even if those implants were made of adamantium, I'd still be able to…
 Sorry.  Cramp.
 (sighing) I'm not gonna be needing your services tonight after all.
 Dr. Riggin.  Figures you'd be wrapping up the trial by now.  I just wanted to give you a hearty mazel tov.
 What do you mean?  What happened?
 Any indication the rats were getting sick?
 Ugh!
 Ah!  Ugh!  Ugh!
 I tried calling everyone else.  You were the last one on the list.
 It's not an emergency.
 (gasping) I'm not attempting bypass surgery.  The tumors are small and they're close to the surface.  I thought it'd be like… removing a wart.
 Surgeons are idiots.  They'd just hack away at the muscle until they get worn out.
 I got one of the tumors.  The second one is close.  (nodding to the scan on the wall) You can use the CT to help you find the third.
 (pleading) Just–just excise the tumor.
 I was trying to make it better.
 Here we go.  Wish I had called 911.
 Well, you know, I've had a lot of setbacks lately.
 There are no cars coming.  Just go.
 (imitating the pirate Brownbeard from the cartoon) If you don't want Brownbeard to end up with two wooden legs, better get yer ma to move this ship, you mangy bilge rat.
 If you want to lecture me on my poor judgment, there would seem to be more relevant examples.
 I'm fine.
 No, it was so lame.  Got a boat full of guy pirates and they make the girl pirate walk the plank.
 That's 'cause she had big boobies.  That's why he should have kept her.
 2:00 a.m.  Nice of you to call me back.
 You've completely run out of ideas and you're calling me to bail you out.  I'm touched.  Hit me.
 She on any medication… besides crack?
 Can I guess stuff too?  'Cause that's gonna make the diagnosis really easy.
 Yeah, that would have been pre-coma.  But how could you have known that it would affect her that way?
 How about renal cancer throwing clots?
 That's too bad.  'Cause that was my one big idea.
 Tell me more about the patient.  What was she doing before prison?
 Way to bury the lead.  How long ago was the shooting?
 Again, you assumed she's had Hep-C for ten years.  Find out when she shot the kid, you'll find out when she started taking drugs, and when she actually contracted the Hep-C.
 It's more relevant than what you got now, which is squat.
 Three chicks just came into my bedroom.  I got to go.  (He disconnects)
 Wait.  I want you in there.
 Well, you can make sure that… idiot butcher doesn't cut more than he needs to.
 Yeah, and if that involves chopping off my leg… I want to be sure that that's damn well necessary. (He sighs)
 I don't trust him.  I trust you.
 What are you doing here?
 Hot nurse, candy striper…  Someone who doesn't speak English.  Someone who doesn't speak judgmental.
 I have to pee.
 (throwing back the blankets) I'm a big boy.
 What, for trying to walk on a freshly mangled leg?  Performing surgery on myself?  For thinking I could solve my emotional problems with rat medicine?  If you're gonna nag, at least have the decency to be specific.
 Can I pee first?
 I know.
Hey. We were just getting to the good part.
Nope. But I subscribe to her patient file.
Minor surgery, removing a drain.
My doctor says it's okay as long as I don't leave my hospital bed.
Nurse.
I do things like that now. I'm making some changes… like skipping ahead to minute 37.
Philistine.
Her assistant. He's been instructed not to intervene. Spoiler alert — he does. [Luca drops what he’s holding and wrestles the guy away from Afsoun who moves for the first time, turning her head to watch them. She looks worried.] For her, it is literally heartbreaking. [Afsoun falls off her stool and is stretched out on the floor.] Let the games begin.
And the pressing issue of shaving your entire body in public while wearing a monkey mask. [He pulls up a picture of that from an on-line article.]
She's not nuts.
What speaks to me is she's elevated being full of crap to a genuine art form and made a fortune doing it. People that pay 20 grand for one of her video stills, on the other hand, really do need their dorsal nexi checked.
[pulling up the picture of Afsoun lying on the floor] Carbon monoxide poisoning. It fits. Put her in a hyperbaric chamber.
Did I text you that? That was meant for my dream journal. I wanted to return your stuff. Don't worry. I didn't go AWOL. I had my wife-maid bring it over.
Given your thing for Owen Wilson, I thought you might want those last two back asap.
You masturbate to Owen Wilson.
Oh. It's a symbolic gesture. I want things to go back to the way they were before we started dating — no more bad feelings, no more issues, just work. [she nods, skeptically] Thanks for coming.
I was self-destructive. It won't happen again. I'm making changes. I'm gonna stop doing stupid things.
I think I could avoid putting another hole in my leg without talking about my mother.
I'm a big believer that the best way to get past the past is to shoot it in the head, bury it in a deep pit, and pour lye on it.
Bring me lunch tomorrow, and we can plumb my depths.
What's he been doing since she was admitted? Did he bring anything from the patient room to the treatment room?
Does she seem like the kind of woman who needs a stuffed animal?
[flirtatious, sleazy] What are you wearing? [fake “duh” expression] Oh, I can see what you're wearing. Go to her room.
[voice on the phone] Now go address the elephant in the room.
[voice on the phone] The reason Luca couldn't decide what to do in the treatment room is the same as in the gallery. He's been told not to intervene. Congratulations. We've become her latest work of art.
Our practice opens us up to malpractice.
Her being sick is a clue.
Thirteen's right — at least her conclusion was. Everything else was laughably wrong. If the patient induced pancreatitis and a heart attack, she'd be suicidal.
Exactly. If she wanted to be dead, she'd be dead a long time ago. Pretending to cheat death pays better than watercolors. Coxsackie B fits. But do a spiral C.T. of her biliary tree to rule out gallstones.
Sure. I'd be happy to come with you. Thanks for asking.
If you really cared about me, you wouldn't be so obvious when you scheme to prove me wrong. You volunteered because you want to C.T. her lungs, not her biliary tree. You want to find fibrosis and prove your "paint thinner" theory. If I don't come with, when you fail, you'll pretend you never tried. I don't really have a choice, now, do I?
Since I've seen your paycheck, I probably shouldn't. [He takes the money.] Canned beans aren't so bad… as long as they're cooked over an oil-drum fire under a bridge with the king of the hobos.
Get her out of here and scope her.
Sorry. Should have scheduled my patient's internal bleeding for Thursday.
Got you to go all the way to the second floor of a building you work in. Boy, did I screw with you.
Check the sign. It says you got to treat me with intensive care.
All we do is fight.
Dominika is a licensed aesthetician.
So all this was about you?
Wow, I hadn't realized the incredible healing power of lunch.
Lunch at 1:00, tomorrow in the cafeteria. You happy?
I don't know. Is "your mother" a number?
Shooting up heroin wouldn't explain—
It must have been a very distinctively shaped and awfully talkative puncture for you to get all of that.
She was researching me?
Now you're just pissing me off.
If you don't know anything, then why are you talking?
I'll take it out on whoever I think will irritate you the most.
I didn't realize that search engines could look within the soul.
What the hell was the point of this? What personal trauma are you exploiting. I’m… sorry — mining for its artistic potential?
Why me?
[annoyed] Why me?
You know, there's a lot of games I could play that don't involve dealing with narcissistic, manipulative poseurs.
[quietly] No.
You took an oath… an oath to be cool. At least that was the one I mumbled under my breath while everyone else was doing the boring one.
So what? I like the game. It's fun. Go get a blood culture. Check for parasites and bacteria.
The new House is about making my life healthier. Never said anything about yours. Go get her blood.
That was incredibly condescending. Did it work?
You think she actually is suicidal.
[reaching for his laptop] There is another explanation. The reason she didn't react isn't 'cause she wants to die. It's 'cause she knows she can't do anything about it. Whatever she has is fatal. [He turns the screen so Thirteen can see the picture House pulled up. Afsoun looks drawn and ashen.] That should narrow it down.
Testing a theory. It's based on some stuff you can't understand, like RR variability, and some stuff you can, like the fact that she shaved her head in an art piece four months ago.
It was a commentary on the fact that it was gonna fall out anyway, and she wanted to hide why.
See that tumor-ish thingamajig near her "brainamabob"?
Are you getting this? Game's over. I won. Primary CNS lymphoma with associated paraneoplastic syndrome.
And then you cleared it. Then you realized you could use your death to make your magnum opus. Maybe you wanted to show that no one can cheat death, even an entire team of doctors with unlimited resources. Or maybe your first doctors didn't treat you like a person — just a series of symptoms. You wanted to re-create that depersonalization. And I was the man to see.
No, I didn't. And I don't actually think your piece is about anything. I think you just figured out that you're mortal. You're just a bag of cells and waste with an expiration date. You wanted to act out. You wanted people to notice. [pause] Maybe you even prayed for a different answer this time. [He picks up the elephant cam and holds it at arms length.] I got a title for your piece — "It Doesn't Mean Anything."
No. [Wilson waits.] What you just said implies that I stopped at some point.
You have any idea how much extra work you've just given yourself? You're not gonna last a week.
You've chosen this moment to give me crap about my Vicodin use?
So is my leg.
Okay. So maybe I am trying to numb myself a little, because I'm trying to change, trying to stop being self-destructive.
What do you want from me?
No. You know what I feel right now? I don't feel miserable or angry. I don't feel good or bad. I feel… nothing… which feels great.
Moving on. In the direction of my house, where I got some more pills.
I'm a doctor. So, technically—
Why are you still here?
It's not eczema. And it's not cancer.
And it'll get worse. But, you know, dying can also do a number on your ability to think.
Good for you.
So.
Like the Lindbergh baby. You dating anyone?
Look, it's just standard lunch conversation.
Okay, well, if you've gone over to the "we don't talk about things" side, then I've got a pot roast in the oven. [checks his watch]
Well, you know what they say — once you go gimp…
[rubbing his face] You think I have unresolved issues, and you are the unresolved issues.
I did it to fix my life. No, wait. No, I did it because I'm a deeply unhappy person. [raises one finger in “hold on a sec” manner] No–no, I did it to get sympathy from you. I did it to piss you off. I did it because I'm not over you. Or I was over you, and I was moving on. I did it because I wanted to know what it's like not to be in pain. I did it because I want to feel more pain. [Cuddy watches but doesn’t react.] Whatever the reason, it was a bad reason and a bad idea. That's all that matters. [getting up, fake cheerful] Good lunch.
I already did.
Get out of my way.
[loud] You want to know how I feel? [two deep breaths then, quietly] I feel hurt.
It's not your fault.
Sorry. Just checking the stitches on my penis. [pulls his jeans up.]
It's healing.
What?
[to Luca] Get out. [He leaves and he turns to her.] You made a decision.
Why?
Than what — than your brain, your abilities? It's where everything comes from — any meaning in your life, any happiness.
He's already left once. He's gonna leave you again. You don't need to depend on people who are gonna let you down. If you do this, you're a pathetic hypocrite. You're saying that your whole life, all your work up until him was a pointless—
Yeah.
The pasta Arrabbiata was cold.
Cuddy's is on the way. I need to return this.
It was on my mind. I want to get it off.
If I get in trouble? I'm delivering a hair brush.
Get out.
[enunciating] Get out.
[cheerfully] You're right. I feel much better.
No, I think I've had enough. What do you think I should do today?
Not tonight. Cheers.
Yes.
Well, that's the correct answer, isn't it?
No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here.
Is that how our system works? Release the best actors? I shudder to think what that world would be like.
I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like every Friday, and I saw everyone else move into the living room.
Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them. [He just can’t stop himself from being a smart ass.]
Yes.
[quietly] Yeah.
Yeah, why would I wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?
He's on 80 mg of Propranolol. That's 40.
I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.
You really got a thing for swastikas… Mendelson. Like an ironic thing?
So’s "House." I'm Jewish. [Mendelson looks at him.] Nah, I'm a black, gay gypsy. [He walks away. Mendelson is not amused.]
Queen to King's Bishop seven.
You know what's weirder? It’s how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it. Although, to be fair, I am large.
Hi, Rollo. I realize this is probably a rhetorical question — Why are you stealing my stuff?
You heard about my parole, but not about my violent reactions when people steal my tuna. Put it back.
Really? You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds and who’s carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon.
[voice from the hall] Yep.
If you like tuna, you're a little late.
It's not gonorrhea.
Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fever, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription.
Not going back. And that look of shock is elitist and offensive. Doctors can be degenerates. This is America. [back to the case] There's subtle eyebrow loss. It's lupus.
Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.
"Usually"? Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work. [She gapes at him as he turns to leave. Sykes is amused. Then House turns back, a little worried.] You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?
You think one of Santa's reindeer was called Stomper?
I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.
Hey, Stomper.
I brought it to your cell.
I was just getting to that part. Rollo followed me in and took it.
Way. I don't wanna start any rumors, but—
Well, he was all, you know, "I can take Stomper." And I was all, "how come?" And he was all, "'cause of how Diaz kicked his ass last month." In fact, he actually called you "Stompee," with an "ee." I think his gist was…
[removes his earphones] Is that, like, a synonym for "clever"? By the time they get out of solitary, I'll be teaching physics at the University of Fiji.
This another pet? 'Cause it's gonna end badly. Again. Remember we talked about this? At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily. [Asofa stares eerily.] I think it was eerily. "Eerily" felt like the best-case scenario.
Hey. Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.
Well, if you can think of a better way to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears. Now, let's get this over with.
Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old.
Belief implies a level of giving a crap that I am never gonna achieve. Pull down your pants.
Hey. It's not that I was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning, and I noticed a rash on his left thigh.
Something very obvious and very boring.
Oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone. Name should've been a giveaway. I'll send him up.
Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting.
Your shoes — different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal. Antique locket — it's unpolished gold. Not some hipster thing. It's a family heirloom, which means old money. Osler scarf — only on Fridays, which means you did your residency at Hopkins, which means you're smarter than our interactions would so far indicate. And your eyes — the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis. So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.
I didn't want a big, emotional scene.
How many do you want?
Come on, Mendelson. I should be on six a day. I get four, and I give you two. [silence] Fine. Get one in my cell after lights-out. Plus Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, that's 11 in all.
They give out four a day, Max.
What if I just go into protective custody, spend the next three days in the hole?
Porter.
I was thinking of something more… Vicodin-y. At least 16, and I need them Friday at noon.
I am peep-less.
No. I mean, you ever see me chatting on the phone, taking visitors?
Just get 'em to me as soon as you can.
What happened?
[quietly] Who hit you?
It’s not lupus.
Does it feel good?
No, I'm just going through a bit of withdrawal. I'm trying to survive on one a day for the next few days.
It's not lupus. He broke his arm.
He was in a jostle.
That's why he'd lie to the guards. He's got no reason to lie to me.
See? There are those eyes again. [He moves toward the desk and Adams grabs Nick’s folder and holds it away from House.] How about a viral syndrome? Or MRSA? No, that wouldn't chew up the bone that fast. But reaction to meds could. [holds out his hand for the chart] May I?
How long can I assume that he's been smoking? Based on his yellow fingers.
I'm out of here on Friday.
Well, how about… if he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the x-ray to do the autopsy. Start him on blood thinners.
[leaving] To the proof store.
[lifts his head] About me not caring? I thought so. [He goes back to listening, tapping on Nick’s chest with a couple of fingers.]
Listen, I'm trying to listen to your lungs, not your self-pity. [He stops and gets up, grabbing his cane.] Cancer can wait. [joining Frankie who was walking past] Hey, heading out to the yard?
You mind trying to find me a cricket?
I'll dress 'em the same, like in Vertigo.
[thoughtfully] Good point. [He sees Porter and turns to follow him.] Hey. How's it coming?
[sitting on the next gurney] Now try an inch to the left. Hear the difference?
It's called an acoustical shadow. It means he's got a tumor.
Start the blood thinners.
[simultaneously] Yeah
[incredulous] Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right?
That's… that's a good idea.
Before I went to med school, I thought about getting a Ph.D. in physics. You ever heard of dark matter? The way galaxies rotate, the motion of the Universe… it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect. It's been theorized but no one's ever proved it exists.
It's the greatest mystery there is — the theory of everything.
Well, me and humanity, we got together too young.
Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.
Jiminy didn't chirp much last night. If it's a disease, then he's six inches under. [He taps some bicarb into the bottle.] But this could also be pesticide poisoning… [He shakes the bottle well] Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat. [He adds some to a postcard which he picks up and, blocking the view with his body, slips under an upturned half bottle with the new cricket in it. He steps to the side so Asofa can see the “cured” cricket.] See? Just so much and no more.
Mm… [silence] This is where you say "thank you." [nothing] Or I say thank you for not killing me. [long pause] Thank you.
I'm fine.
It’s not gonna help.
You trust me?
[reaching for the file] Not that much to the first, and not at all to the second. But if it'll get me the file…
This guy's the only one with symptoms. It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.
Can you get me an escort to gather samples?
You need to get cotton swabs—
You're a prisoner on tier time. By definition, you have nothing to do.
You're moving slower. You're getting weaker. This thing's attacking your bones, your joints, your blood.
[frustrated and annoyed] She's not your girl, you idiot. She was the girlfriend of a loser drug dealer. Think she's got the self-control to wait around for three years? You think she should? There's a reason we're locked away from nice, normal people. [relenting, nicer] Your life outside is over. Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with, they've moved on.
Where's Sykes?
Great. I'm gonna go through the laundry. Give me some swabs.
What? He yelled at you for letting me see the file? You'll get over it. A few years of therapy—
[enters and closes the door behind him] Okay, so I drove a car into a wall instead of stealing some pills. You obviously don't care what I did. You care that I lied to you. You feel jilted.
I had a bad lawyer.
Uhhh!
I-I-I can't get all 20, but once I get out—
I need your help. You have any matches?
What about a stick of gum?
I'm gonna need that too.
Why do I need the pen that you always carry around and never write with? [Frankie hands it over.] This is plan "B." [He clicks the pen, revealing a blade.]
What is it?
You're confusing me with the clinic again.
As soon as you leave, I am.
I'm just done. No you, no medicine, no fixing people. Done. Now get out.
[looks at Nick for the first time] Your lips are swelling. Open your mouth. Did you just eat something?
You allergic to anything? [Nick collapses. House lowers him to the floor while yelling for help.] Guard! You're going into anaphylactic shock. Guard! Dammit. I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.
He's having an allergic reaction. He can't breathe.
Alvarez, look at what I'm doing! It's a tracheotomy. Come on, man. You know I'm a doctor.
I have no idea.
Saving us both from contraband charges. It was great knowing you. [He knocks on his cell door. A guard arrives. House talks to him through the locked door.] I need to be taken into protective custody.
Wow. [The guard accompanying him waits impatiently.] That was great. I think I really dodged a bullet there.
[walking away, toward his cell] Uh, it's nothing personal. We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise.
It wasn't the food. It was the heat. It's mastocytosis. It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank.
No, no! It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work. Just give him five aspirin. [Adams looks very puzzled.]
You do understand the meaning of the word "confirm."
Well, what do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?
It's his risk to take. If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?
[quietly, choosing his words carefully] You're a moron and a coward. I'll do it myself.
I need 20. [She pulls a bottle of pills out of her pocket and gives him some.] And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.
You can't if you're not willing to do—
[looks around, worried; nods] You're absolutely right.
[pleasantly] Thanks for getting me to the clinic.
[off-screen] C.O.! We have a little problem here!
Alvarez!
Where's the aspirin?
Yeah, it's always a direct order. Eight months. Haven't heard an indirect order in here.
[putting some aspirin in a folded sheet of paper and smashing them] Sorry. Distracted. You were saying?
No.
'Cause I have a gift. [to Nick] Once you drink this, you should get an attack almost immediately. That is, if I'm right.
If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.
Just drink it! Drink it!
Come on, just a little more time.
 Must be some mistake.  I specifically requested my wakeup startle three hours from now.
 I've had dreams about this.  I'm going to assume this is another one.
 I can refuse to see any visitor I want.  Tell the Dean that I don't want to see her.
 (rolling back to look up at the guard) He?
 What's the hiring policy over there?  All ass based?
 Not unless that file has a file in it.
 I had eight months added to my sentence two months ago.  The math is pretty basic.
 No, thanks.  You think it's a good idea for me to go right back to my old life?  For either of us?
 I did pay for the room for the whole week, but…
 Nice painting.  Blues and greens.  Calming, but with a hint of nurturing.  Totally offsets the stench of suffering and death.  Where's my patient?  We need to not talk.
 Great.  (holding out the file) Take this.
 I completely understand and, almost respect your desire to appear to be Dean of Medicine, given that your title is Dean of Medicine.  On the other hand… Seriously?
 Yes, massa.
 When did Cuddy leave?
 Don't need the details.
 Where's my stuff?
 What about my team?
 No, it doesn't.
 I'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.
 3:00 a.m.  If Foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have
 Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now and unavailable to help.  Which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work.  Which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.
 Then go back to neurology.
 (loudly) Prison!  Sorry, I thought I heard everyone else think that.  I was in prison, you see.  It was a long time ago, but still, you're curious.  Never was raped, not raped-raped.  Well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped.  Well, now that we've got that completely behind us.
 Is there cake?  Any alveolar exudate?
 Well it's not ARDS.  It's the autumn.  Its tick borne disease season.  Ehrlichiosis causing bronchialitis.  You'll appreciate that I left the "idiots" subtextual.
 Cocaine.
 Dead men don't pee.  Tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine.  Coke never got past the lungs.  Also explains the motorcycle crash.  Idiots.
 Great idea.  Unless you're wrong.  And by you, I mean me.  Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs.  I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word.  (to Park) Kato, get Black Beauty and meet me out front.  (looking directly at Wilson) We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.
 Since an 18-year-old with organ donor on his license is not a cancer patient, I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the Wilson cares too much club.
 You're the reason I'm out of the big house.  Doesn't quite make up for never visiting—
 It amounts to the same thing.  You wanted me back.
 Strong, emotional reaction.  I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you.  How’s your wrist?
 I was wrong.  I went to prison.  I paid the price. (Wilson’s pager beeps)
 I said I was wrong.  I didn't say I changed.  I haven't.  Neither have you—
 Bright side — they're probably up weeping.  Hey, we both assaulted our bosses.  It's like we're twins.
 Okay, I'll go first.  My boss dumped me.  And yours what?  Called you his China doll?  Joked about what a crappy deal you got for Manhattan?  Assumed you have a huge penis?  I have no idea what flavor you are, so I thought I’d just cover the spread.
 Behind what?  Oh, yeah, your — grabbed your tushy.  So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.
 Your parents know your call schedule?
 Right.  No issues there.
 Druggies are not known for their honesty.  Trust me on this one.
 Sorry.  But we're on a clock.
 (looking up at Mr. Weathers) Nope.  His son is dead.  The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.  It doesn’t matter how much we piss him off as long as we find something.  So go back there, piss him off and find something.
 Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.
 Because he was having headaches?
 Answer the question before answering the door.
 You’re right.  He was not doing cocaine.  He had a brain tumor.
 Don't bother.  It's for me.  (propping his foot on the dresser, and pulling up his pant leg to reveal the monitor) Turns out they monitor these monitors.
 I thought the bracelet was decorative.  My aunt had one just like it.  Wait a minute.
 Dead kid's house was on the way to my apartment.  (He picks up his cane and stands) Assuming I got lost, twice.
 I knew you were very busy, being vaguely important.
 Yeah, it's the word "might" that bumps me, but I’ll run it by you next time.  (He turns to leave)
 Disciplinary hearing should be fun, and the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.
 (feeling the body’s upper right arm) There's a mass in the arm.  Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.
 So, where’s the next job?  You worry about what people think of you, and parental secrets.  The only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one.  The only way that happens is you leave Princeton Plainsboro.
 My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma.  (giving the jar to Park) Chicago has a great program, and you're a dumbass.
 Running away from home is a time-honored tradition, but you're not doing it to flee your parents.  You're doing it to protect them.  (He picks up his cane) That's an insult to everything teen prostitutes have worked for.  Time to grow up and come clean.
 This is so our song.
 Not worried.  My team is confirming the diagnosis as we speak.
 See?  I smell empathy.
 You should remember all the good times.  Like when I gave you that necklace that you just dumped n the ocean.  What were you thinking?
 Come in.
 Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.
 Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs.  They're reacting to something in the plasma.
 Still.  (picking up his cane and heading out the door) It's not as bad as a thousand people going down in a gigantic boat, right?  My heart will go on. (He leaves Wilson’s office)
 25 donors contributed to the plasma that the lung donor got.  My team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.
 You asked me to ask you.  Was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?
 Actually you have to.
 Fine, then give me a team I don't have to put in quotation marks.
 Give me Chase, Taub, Thirteen.
 Oh, yeah.  (looking around the newly decorated office) It went to interior designers, I understand.
 I am?
 What do you got?
 Boredom is not transmissible.
 Nice.
 Nothing.
 Start what?  I'm enjoying our conversation.  The repartee.
 That was repartee.
 It's just good to hear your voice.
 That's my whiteboard.  I need it.  And he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.
 I'll take this outside.
 (answering the phone) Yeah.
 Good.
 Yeah.
 He’d have to be pretty drunk for it to affect a pool of plasma.
 Who's painting?
 (speaking it at the same time as Park does) Lead.
 Reverend Moon started it about 20 minutes ago.  You missed lunch tracking down the plasma donors.  Got you a Reuben from the cafeteria.
 It will.
 Oh, no, she could die.  But technically it will still pay off.  Even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.
 (into the phone) Page Dr. Pinto stat to the cath lab.
 What?  Who?  One dead lobe means four alive ones.  It means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.
 You have unlimited texting.  Until your parents know, you will never see that punch for what it really was.  Your February 4th.  Sri Lankan Independence Day.
 And I told you I wasn't listening.  By my actions.
 You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew.  Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw.  Maybe it's your character.
 (acknowledging the doctor) Pinto!
 (to Park) Embrace your inner bitch.
 So why did chelation make the lungs worse?
 We got about five minutes till Pinto gets back.  Give me a hand with this.
 Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment.  (He looks at the chair then back at Park) I am a cripple, in need of assistance.
 It's mine.  And it's your job.
 This chair will help me do that.
 Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.
 But… maybe the problem isn't a heavy metal from outside.  It's inside.  But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to.  It's stuck.  Iron.  The donor had hemosiderosis.
 Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.
 I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.
 Pinto.
 Enter.
 Ah, explains the hole in this chair.
  God, I missed doors.  And air freshener.
 Now go away.  I'm waiting for some test results.
 It's not my fault you can't handle your patient.
 And what's after respect?  You find another angle.  You hold her hand, get the sister to beg,  (he throws the magazine onto the side table) stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear.  You do whatever it takes.
 Infection was right, after all.
 Fresh fruit in prison is usually chicken.
 (yelling) Aahh, she's dying!  (speaking normally again) Were you able to figure out what was wrong while I was screaming?
 Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open.  If they're hiding inside the lung cells… I'm thinking brucella.  And to wipe that out, you need special ops.  (Park looks confused) An intact immune system.
 They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry.  But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above.  (Park still does not understand)
 (explaining) Antibiotics and IVIG.
 No, they were stupid too.
 (lifting his head to look at Wilson) Case is under control.  It's me time.
 So we're good?
 I like you.  (WiIson stops and looks back at House) I have fun with you.  (House pushes up to a sitting postion) And, if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me, I can accept that.  But, just do whatever you have to do to get over this.  You can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.  Either/or.  Both seems excessive.
 When did the discoloration start?
 Means we're wrong about infection.
 Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues…  Increase peep.
 I need… I need ideas.
 That's already ruled out.
 (frustrated) No--o.
 We're out of time when we're out of time.  When they die or she dies.  Keep them stable as long as you can.  I need to think.  (He leaves)
 The lungs are a smoker.  (speaking to the lungs) You of all people should know better.
 He played poker.  Who plays poker without cigars?  Even if he didn't light up himself…  It was a rainy night.  The windows were closed.
 All parents think their kids are special.  And these ones were right.  At least his white blood cells were special.  They had an on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off.  When he inhaled small amounts of smoke, he had small problems.  No one even noticed.  Big amounts of smoke, that's enough to trash a lung.  As soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke, he was a dead man.  The motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.
 I was right.  Not about anything medical, but my metaphors were perfect.  We need to hit it harder.  We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg.  We need the nuclear option.
 See, the metaphors work.
 Won't be fast enough.  Wilson needs these lungs.
 Well, that sucks.  Where are Chase, Taub, and Thirteen gonna sit?
 Oof!
 (still lying on the floor and rubbing his jaw) I heard about a good new vegetarian place.
If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up.
New life, new look.
If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.
You are. Tell me why.
E.R. found nothing wrong, then I decided I should test his wallet.
No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich.
Dr. Adams. (To Park) Give her the file.
My M.O. depends upon the use of a team. Definitionally, that involves… more than one person. So I really have no choice. Give her the file.
Adams is free. And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag (Adams gives him a look). New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.
Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee. Wait… did you think I was referring to sex? (To Park) Would you shut the blinds on your way out?
In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town — ladling kittens, spaying soup…
Well, think of this as today's free clinic. Only with fewer bums with herpes.
What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?
You saved a life.
That's right, all those babies with AIDS, they're just using us.
(Pointing to Adams) Rebuttal.
I object to your cynicism.
That's what I object to. The new Dean of Medicine has an ethical obligation to come in with a completely open mind about all employees, thus letting me blithely run roughshod for at least four weeks.
(Sarcastically) What?
[Shouts] What?
I talked to Chase and Taub. They're willing to come back.
Not a good choice. She's not long term because she has no long term.
She will.
Unexplained loss of consciousness could be cardiomyopathy, global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage—
(To Park) Send him home. And check with admitting for the net worth of all new patients.
Technically, you're back right now.
I'm putting the band back together.
(Showing her his monitor) Guilty as charged. Literally.
The job went away, but not the profession. You look healthy, so… that's not it. You met a boy. Or a girl. Fall in love, wanna be happy. You decided to… enjoy what time you have left. You're going to Thailand.
No, you wanna like boring. But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.
(As she leaves) No.
You showed up to tell me that you don't want to hear from me. That's a mixed signal. I will choose to listen to your actions rather than your words. They're more honest.
Which is awesome. Now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for.
Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.
If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement.
Racing heart: Medical condition. Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.
I'm told that some people are just nice. I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.
Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG. No, wait. I'll do the flushing. (To Adams) Take the damn $2.00. She hasn't even sipped the coffee. (Walks out)
I just got so angry. You know? So I made a terrible mistake. Now I'm trying to start my life over. To help people the way I always wanted. But my department got defunded, and… it's my fault. Just can't stand to think of all those patients going untreated because I don't have the resources to do my best work.
How do you mean?
Wow. I am an opportunistic ex-con who just gave you a two-minute sob story as step three in my master plan, and you've offered me a million dollars. Which is step 17.
Ethics are not my strong suit.
Hypothetical — if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline? Don't answer yet. Saying no will cause both of us pain. Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.
Could be wrong about the symptom. I'm wrong all the time.
What is this, Canada? All we do is take money from sick people.
I'm working!
20 dollars. (Wilson gesticulates) Well, what if it was? It's the same principle. 20 dollars, a million… What's the difference?
He came up with the figure, not me.
What?
It's all moot. Patient probably has long QT. Probably just a really, really decent person. They exist, right?
So… arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors. Plus, unfortunately, mental changes.
God bless you.
(To Park) She's not drinking the coffee either.
Yeah, why?
Your parents didn't love you enough. So you need to prove your superiority. Or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility. Or it's just rich guilt. I'm betting on the last one.
I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.
[Echoing] Virus, virus, virus, virus…
Start him on antivirals. And, Adams… when you treat, and he gets better, and doesn't give Bob Cratchit Christmas day off, you owe me a coffee. (He gets up and walks out)
Thank you. Appreciate your help.
No, not at all.
Yes, absolutely.
Great. See you tomorrow morning.
Afternoon? I can't think of another interpretation.
(Looking at his computer screen) Everything has gone blue. That's not supposed to happen, right?
No… you don't have to do that. Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a Szechuan beef.
Oh, okay, then. Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.
You're a peach.
Better. We're discharging him.
Hey, hey, hey. Why do you care? Specifically. Although I'm curious about a general answer too.
Did he meet your patient with renal failure?
I was wrong.
He's not better. His mental status is declining.
I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.
He's still sick.
Not all of them. Offering an organ to a stranger is a symptom.
Yeah, how many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?
You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument. If there's even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.
Yeah. If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden.
See? Crazy.
People with mental deficiency can be logical. Just like sane people can be illogical.
No, you won't. (Limps out to a bench where Park is sitting. She gets up and follows him)
We have time for one more test before we move him.
Whatever test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously.
Bad idea. There's no joint pain. Where's Adams?
'Cause I called her. Bigger question is why that worked.
We're too busy for rationalizations. Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life. He's probably not eating all that healthy.
Wait until they take him back to his room — draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile.
(To Park) You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.
Guilt. You feel guilty about leaving.
Not leaving me. Leaving humanity.
To have fun.
Oh… no one's unhappy in Greece.
Does it itch? Do anything different lately? You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?
It is in the water.
No… [Inhales deeply] He's allergic to summer lilac.
No, it's on the palms of his hands. In the pool is the neighbor's daughter. Or the neighbor's hot wife. Here's some lube. (Gives it to the kid) Sorry. Too late for your eyesight.
Found it in my office. Appears to be a gift. That can't be good. (Gives it to Park)
You got her the job interview.
Good for you! You loon.
So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you. Or it's your family, some kind of immigrant pride thing. I'm betting on the last one.
That's the reason? Ickiness? You never even tried to analyze this? It's even crazier than the gift thing.
Well… we did what we could.
Ah, Dr. Foreman. Perhaps you can help us. I can't decide whether to take out an "I told you so" ad in the New England Journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.
That seems like an overreaction.
Don't apologize. I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but I know she's right. Two lives are in the balance here.
And I was your boss for seven years. And I know what a suspicious, micromanaging hard-ass you are. Why would I do this now? Knowing you can send me right back to jail?
Nothing! You can't prove otherwise. So why don't you do the smart thing here?
[Sighs] He's the boss. And he's right.
I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job? [Paper crumpling] What's with you and Park?
I expect my people to lie better than that. Either you're getting her gifts because you want her to like you, in which case I don't like you, or you're getting her gifts to screw with her. In which case, I will be teaching you my secret homey handshake.
But now?
[Chuckles softly] What was in the box?
Nah, that's not gonna do it. You're up against a lifetime of training. If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciprocate. You gotta push her neuroses to the point where even she thinks that she's crazy.
One more favor. Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forever. Or I'm lying. Either way, it's more interesting than whatever you're doing now.
You know, the "down" vibe in here is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy. [Buzzing continues] (To Park) And that haircut isn't helping, either.
Or pericarditis.
It's unlikely… but it's possible. What else? (Nobody says a thing) I said what else?
Oh, for…
There. That's better. Now, what else? (Thirteen, Adams, and Park are all out of ideas.) Well, if there's nothing better than possible, then possible gets upgraded to probable.
So what's the answer? Are you now on the team? [Mocking Park] Like, forever?
'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.
So… guilt?
Obviously not.
How's your patient?
I have a gift. (Suddenly, it hits him. He gets one of his million-yard stares, those where he figures what’s the deal with his patient, typical when he’s with Wilson)
It was a con.
No, I was. I brought him in here under false pretenses. Just to get his money. I ordered a bunch of random tests to keep him here. One of them was a head CT, which uses… iodine contrast.
No, again. Just don't interrupt me. Thirteen was right. This is a thyroid issue. He has Plummer's disease. (He gets up) He has a nodule in his thyroid. It produces excess hormone. Not enough to test abnormal, just more than his brain is used to. Just enough to make him irrationally generous, make him vulnerable to overheating.
I said don't interrupt. But, yes, you're right. Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.
Two days, one surgery. I now accept that you’re all better. Where's my money?
You were already sick. I just made you much, much worse. Seriously… the money. You're not giving it to me, are you?
You love your family. You want them back. Your altruism was always a symptom.
Keep less? How much less? Just enough to spoil your kids?
But they need it more than people with TB or children in Indonesia with no eyes? Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?
I was an ass last week.
No. It makes you a healthy person. (Walks out)
Good work. Need a lift tomorrow? 'Cause your car is still in the shop.
Nothing is ever over. (Park leaves)
Thirteen. Wait a minute. (Thirteen walks towards House) You're fired.
I'm not joking. You're fired. Don't come in tomorrow.
I can work with people who've got nowhere else to go. People who got something to prove. People who just get off on weird cases. What I can't work with is someone who's here so she doesn't have to feel bad.
Yes… I think that little of you and that much of me.
This would totally suck.
Funduscopic exam was normal. If you don't let me read my email, then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff. From your ex-boss. [She opens the laptop back up.] Thank you. [reading the email] "Last month, I had an incident involving another P.P.T.H. employee. Though I can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, I want you to know that I have completed voluntary sexual harassment training. And on a personal note, if my actions caused anyone distress, I sincerely apologize." You are so fired.
What? Because he said he apologized? He's saying he's sorry that someone, namely you, overreacted — namely, by punching him.
Word is it was a celebratory slap after you completed your first-ever AVM embolization.
The classes make him sympathetic. Which, in turn, makes his unrepentant attacker… Evil. Which, in turn, in turn, makes you so fired.
Oh, you don't wanna bet me.
Oh, my.
You're fired.
But I thought—
If only—
I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole.
You're late.
Pearl earrings? Knee-length dress. That's not a very shameful walk of shame.
I hope it went terribly.
I am an equal opportunity exploiter. I only help those who can help myself. [Buzzing sound in the background. A cast is being sawed off in the Orthopedics room, House’s former Diagnostics room.] I have a department to re-fund.
Pupils are normal.
Not… a terrible idea. I'm gonna go give him P.T.U. and T.L.C. I have no idea what that second one stands for.
Well, then, these giant balls of medicine are not gonna work anymore. The change actually makes things simpler. Your occipital lobe is acting up, giving you a migraine.
I never joke. Good news is, it's treatable with medication. Bad news is… it can make you very, very late for very important dates. I sometimes joke.
I get it. Answer's no. Shouldn't have said anything. I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for China. [He hands Barton the prescription.] 'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there would be so optimistic, considering… [Speaking Mandarin] How they look down on mental illness.
Oh, just how different the two cultures are. For example, our opinions on mental illness. Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition. [Speaking Mandarin] There, it’s taboo enough to destroy a high profile business deal.
You're hired! Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub. [He grabs a chair and sits with them.] Keep your Nazi sentiments quiet around the little one.
Patient's a smart businessman.
Jobs are not being destroyed. They're being relocated. The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot. To put it another way, a patriot.
Iranian women. Drag Queens in Uganda. Patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate, real estate that's been conquered 800 times by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures. But each time, it's just the best. [House leans in and grabs the burger in Adams’s plate.] I claim this burger in the name of Queen Isabella of Spain.
He's never gonna know. He's actually in here right now.
I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome. Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide non-apology apology this morning, I assume that plagiarism is the new black.
Copying him makes you look pathetic. And I will pay you not to go to anger management classes.
It's possible. Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.
I heard about your conversation with the patient's daughter. You were hostile.
Yet you were never anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison. Those guys made decisions you supported?
I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.
You got to work at 9:15. Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away. It's not possible. My condolences.
That just leaves… everywhere but a job interview.
Who goes there? Reveal yourself!
Well, we would. But Orthopedics is still squatting in two thirds of my office, which is weird, 'cause you got a large check last night. [He points at the desk.]
Holding your ass. You really didn't know?
Just trying to help you out here. I figure for sure he'd punch me in the face, thus proving it's a natural response. My God, you have super-human discipline. And glutes.
We have a bet.
You two really need to do your homework with me. Treat the patient with activated protein c.
Exactly. It's a conclusive test. There's no actual risk. [The elevator doors open and House enters.] As long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here. [The doors close.]
Itching. Interesting.
Doubly interesting. Means we have to explain the arrival and the departure.
Different wavelengths are stimulating your autonomic nervous system. That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.
Oh ho ho! Cool.
Now, if I punched him in the face, that he could prove.
This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid.
French vanilla, yeah. To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression.
Dutch chocolate's not bad. Gotta give 'em that.
In other words, loyalty gave him cancer. I like it. Start him on radiation. [He leaves his office.]
The best Halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation. [Park comes in.] What took you so long? I already lost one of them.
No, I think I got palliative. Why don't you take preventative?
Which he started. Which means he's both irascible and stupid.
I can't comment on the drunk or the frat. But Chang and Eng were both, in fact, born in Siam. And they were, in fact, twins. If your name was Richard, it would be okay for me to call you a Dick. But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger management class might help keep this guy out of here the next time.
Okay, let's go.
No, I got everything I need.
Sometimes… [With playback] It's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who deserves it. Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.
Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities. Get him an echo to confirm. I need $200,000. [Adams looks shocked and amused.] His company's lost one third of its value since he was admitted.
It's not insider trading. Just betting on myself to solve the case. Once we cure him, share price goes up, I pay you back.
No, you don't say "no." You… make a counter offer.
Fine. I'll make you a counter. $100,000. $20,000. I'll buy options instead of shares. More risk, but more upside. But that's as low as I'm gonna go.
Really? No backsies.
So you want twice as many of them disrespected?
And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea.
Here's what I'm thinking. You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old patients was denied. Hence the attire, hence the tardiness. And, most important, hence the anger. You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here. More annoyingly, by having me do it. [Adams walks away.] And deal!
Of course, you know… this means war.
Nice idea. Even has a metaphor in it. Not worth more than my honor. But delightful, all the same.
You will be eloquent in your loss. This case boils down to he said, she said. He said, "I've been working at this hospital for 15 years and I'm taking self-improvement classes." She said, "I've been a fellow for two months, and I'm kind of weird."
Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not AA. That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking. Which means that Foreman signed off on it, which means that he set all the wheels in motion. Forget that. Wild speculation. Go do the EP study.
Seems healthy to me. Let's release him. My option to sell Barton Foods at $34 is about to expire. So they thought the patient would be better by now. Instead, I am going to lose $20,000.
Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson. Plus the ten I got on margin. You're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney. [He grabs the chocolate bar he paid for.] Unless… There is a way that you can get your money back. [They all star walking.] Give me the full $200,000.
It's your own fault. You forced me to go with the options here. Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances. Regular stock this time, nice and safe.
You refuse to bet on yourself. That means low self-esteem.
Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives. Nice clothes and anger… Classic symptoms. Family gathering. You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with Grammy Adams or Cousin Itt. And she was nagging you about finding a husband.
Ah, ah, ah, ah! [He stops her with his cane.] No spoilers. They ruin everything.
Our patient's lung problem is not a lung problem. It's a brain problem. We're consulting with Neurology.
I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.
Dr. Andrews. My associates. Doctors Adams and Park. [park seems very uncomfortable.]
You really wanna turn your back on this guy? Sorry. Carry on.
Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus going once. Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice…
Do you really believe in this diagnosis? Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a severe anatomical disadvantage.
No… it's normal pressure hydrocephalus. Do a spinal fluid test to confirm.
You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my patient is now in a coma.
At least I'm smart enough to know what I don't know. She went out of her way to defy me! She needs—[Screaming, out of sight] Damn it, you should just fire her!
Right back at ya. Our patient's dying. We need theories.
Yeah, but even a broken doctor's right twice a day. Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky. Coma had to be a lucky guess.
I didn't. I wanted you to do a tilt table test.
I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table. She listens to me, I waste an hour. If she defies me… Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks. [Holding his hand up] Up high.
You're angry.
No. What else would explain our symptoms and make our patient go into a coma during that test? How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?
Or his liver's so far gone it can't even produce enzymes.
We ruled that out three days ago.
Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.
God, but you're petty. Okay, so… two options. Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey.
Ah, shut it off!
Apparently we're allowed to do this now.
This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter "Y."
That's a side effect of not dying. Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy. Complexes of large, y-shaped antibodies were clogging up your blood vessels, causing your organs to shut down one by one. Now, usually with hyperviscosity syndrome, it's caused by an elevated blood count or protein count. Yours eluded us 'cause it was caused by antibodies from your rheumatoid arthritis. Now that they're being filtered out, the blood would be… a little less duck sauce and a little more soy sauce.
It's not all about you. Your stock price will be completely cured. Once you sign this. [He hands him the paper.] It's a press release. It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to China.
Ah, mm, yeah, actually… he does. 'Cause the market opens at 9:00 a.m. And this means a lot to me. You may remember me from the time I saved your life.
Morning.
Got lucky this time.
I sabotaged her hearing. You do read the school paper, don't you?
'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.
That's just hurtful. The fact is, winning $100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her. Here's your five grand. [House hands him a check and Wilson takes it, surprised.]
Just take it. Trust me.
Found her sleeping in the park. Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her. And that is exactly what happened… as far as you can prove.
Fine. Clinic hours. I'll double them.
No… Three times two equals six.
Call Chase and Taub. Get 'em in here. The boys are back.
I know.
Congratulations.
You caught your boyfriend cheating that morning. You had a big fight. That's why you were late. You re-pitched an S.T.D. You haven't gotten two consecutive minutes without using the word "loyalty," which explains the anger and the low self-esteem, and the desire to feel pretty… after having been rejected explains the clothes.
Wow. I missed the fact that you were married.
So… old news? No anger left? [He waits for her answer but she stays quiet. House grabs a baseball bat and hands it to Adams. He shows her all the equipment left around them.] It's all bought and paid for.
What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?
You're late.
Beard's a nice touch. Lets everyone know that you're not a teenage girl. [Chase takes a chair and sits next to Adams.] Oh, now, you two make a cute couple. [Taub prepares to sit next to Park who stands as he approaches.] And you two… [faux stammers] It's not important.
He's lying, not just Taub… the patient. These abrasions on his knees… they're minty fresh… about ten hours old.
Speaking of which, how are your two baby girls?
[making a big show of “oops — wrong thing to say”] Awkward! [normal voice] He knocked up two different women at the same time… At least he thinks he did. You have them DNA tested yet?
But they will grow. Find out what else he's lying about. Do an exercise test… see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.
Hopefully. Then we'll know what set it off.
The prodigal son has returned. [He hugs Chase and slaps his back. Chase stands there, impassive.] Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch.
[loudly] I spent a month in solitary. You don't think I can keep this up all day?
[loudly] Chase and Taub are back!
I also think that Taub has brought his little Taubettes into work with him today.
Because I didn't give him time to do anything else. Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?
What? I just came for a chat with a friend. What's that I smell, friend?
You should probably lie down and rest.
[at the door] Oh! There is one more thing.
[sticking his head in the door at just the right moment] Or I fire you. Look what I found… [He wheels in the Taubettes.] Kiddie-winkies! I wonder who they belong to.
No. I genuinely wonder who they belong to. I need a DNA sample. [He holds up a wrapped swab.]
Already did. This swab's for you. [Taub removes House’s cane from the stroller and trades it with House for the swab. He throws the swab away and wheels the girls to the far end of the room.] Fine. If you don't mind paying a fortune in child support for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek.
Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.
Oh, my God. Two prodigal sons. Come on. Let's hug it out. [He holds his arms wide.]
It's a stupid idea. We would have seen evidence of Brugada in the E.K.G. [He looks at Parks & Adams who are slumped on the couch.] You know, this is… this is just messing with my feng shui here. What about over there? [Points to the wall where the conference table used to be.]
Boring!
Would it hurt to do both? [flops over the couch back and lies down] Oh, this is much better! I said it was boring. I didn't say it was wrong.
Nope. You're wrong. Photic epilepsy… it's equally boring, but it has the advantage of possibly being right. Give him an E.E.G. to confirm.
A dream.
I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma.
You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first. That only takes a couple of hours. Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system is gonna take all night. Monitor his brain activity, start a continuous urine test and blood draws every two hours.
Chase and Adams can do the test.
For the massage bed. You and Park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.
Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night. So I chose night. [He spits into a mug.]
He's only guessing. I'm talking to Taub. He can't say "my kids" until he lets me test them. Tell me about the love shack where he cheated on his bride.
Probably want to boil the kids for a couple hours when you get home.
Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them. [He puts on his dress shirt and buttons it.]
The bulge in his neck. The bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus… Lemierre's Syndrome. Treat with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.
You have at least a trillion cells. You're gonna misplace one of them eventually.
But not his swollen lymph nodes.
I'm an ex-con, trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by. Stealing's all I know… that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our patient. Just wrong about what?
That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
[adding a toaster to his bag] And old team for the win! [Chase and Taub mildly pump their fists at each other.] Not that I'm keeping score. It's more of a grid where I assign numerical values to determine who gets raises, vacation time, and my respect.
Aw, that is cute. [drinking a martini] I'm talking about your breasts. [She puts a hand up to pull the neck of her dress closed.] They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest. Truth. It's uncomfortable, isn't it? More truth… I only noticed because Chase was staring at them. [He sits at the table and continues.] He'd never admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you. Same reason he'd never tell you that he's thought about having sex with you. Although, to be fair, every man you've ever met has thought about having sex with you. They'll lie, because if you knew… you probably wouldn't want to have sex with them. And that's just some of the lies from the last minute. And here's a bigger one… you already know this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized. Most people find it easier to ignore the truth. Ask Taub. Our patient can't wait for a transplant that's never gonna come. We need to get reckless and extreme. C.T. his liver, find the damaged area, and cut it out. Hopefully, what's left will be enough so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?
And scene. Now we're back to boring reality reality. His liver was in shock before. He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.
Or who. This all started when he cheated on his wife.
Or something she's wearing… makeup, perfume, birth control method, her "Hello Kitty" doll. Two of you go find her and find out what. Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.
I take it you're in the latter category.
[clicks his pen a few times] It fits. Case closed. Why don't you go home and get some sleep?
Because there isn't one. The aneurysm is just another symptom. It's not the cause. You add them all together, we get… [He waits, but the team doesn’t answer.] We get Kaw… Kawas… Kawas… [exasperated] It's Kawasaki's Disease. It's autoimmune.
Which you might have, by the way. Which is basically why we missed it. Rug burns… certain carpet-cleaning chemicals have been linked to it. Start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Monitor the aneurysm. If it doesn't resolve itself we'll have to repair it. [addressing Taub, Adams and Park on his way out] The rest of you… aren't surfing enough.
Really? You don't think I should have gone with rat? I've been second-guessing myself all day.
First admit that I was right.
Yeah, I'll admit to that. Now you admit that it was incredibly easy, because you can't cheat an honest man.
What about both? Could be. Haven't read these. Now say I was right.
You do, and I'll prove it. I will shred this. I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it. Or we'll go to the light box in the lab and know the truth once and for all.
New team, old team… I present… Phase one of Operation Outer Office 2.0.
Oh, everything has changed.
You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt. Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.
Wrinkle pattern's too varied. It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.
The tox screen was clean. I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on, not the ex-wife you cheated with. If the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.
Carotid duplex is normal. Who's better qualified to be the daddy? The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values like, not shtupping mommy after the divorce?
Makes sense. Park's tiger mom and dad were so insufferable, she has to measure their affection in hours. Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic mom were so indifferent, he has to believe it's a wash. (looking at Adams) Your turn. What did your screwed-up parents do to screw up your view of parenting?
That's an oxymoron. Chase is right. All parents screw up all children. He's also dreamy, but it's not relevant now.
Transesophageal echo to confirm. Screwed up is your best case. Bouncing between a philandering workaholic dad and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom, it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared.
There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.
Much as I'd like to kill you by dangerously lowering your blood sugar, murder violates my parole.
I am the test. The test is negative. The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass. That last insult was your cue to leave.
Fine. Wait right here.
(to a nurse) Sleep study. Please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.
No, no, no, no, no. Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us. The legendary night, on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.00.
Uh, no, thanks. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you.
Cameras are ringside too. If you want, I could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time.
Well, I'd take me if either of us could. See what a tough spot I'm in?
All right, I'll take the other ticket. Let me worry about logistics.
He has a heart problem but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.
Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart that says "birthday clown."
He's not immuno-compromised. (to Taub) And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.
Take your time. We'll continue with the medicine.
Sjogren's it is. IV immunosuppressants to treat. (looking at Taub) Anything?
"Her"? Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.
Ruby dropped her off. Seemed pretty upset. Apparently someone forgot that it was daddy's night. She wasn't even gonna leave her until I said that I was letting you off early.
She doesn't seem to like that idea. You're right. (speaking baby talk) He has no schistocytes in his smear. (Chase grins)
(to Taub) She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her. Maybe she likes the sound of my voice, which is weird because I have no genetic connection to her. (he stands) Could it be, she doesn't know the difference?
Good point. How could I comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby.
What if you're all right? Low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals…
Kid needs a bone marrow transplant. Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.
(to Adams) You started college a semester late because you left high school a semester late because (he pulls a small note our of his breast pocket and reads it) you had five incompletes in your junior year.
Did okay before that. Straight As after that.
Don't tell me. Mom and dad were at each other's throats and the academic crisis was a cry for help.
Sorry. Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting.
That's cool. I'll wait.
I hate conferences.
Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled and double the hooker budget that you recently halved. I think you refer to it as petty cash.
You said that 9:00 was the premium slot. I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers.
But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here.
Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.
No, but you're not a hypochondriac or you would have imagined some new disease after I shot down the first one. So whose urine is that? Diabetic girlfriend without health insurance?
The medical term is cankles. (sitting down on the stool) Is there some black market in insulin that I don't know about?
Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch.
(reading the file) If the kid's dad died young of melanoma, how come the overprotective mom never took him to a dermatologist?
Not diabetes. (turning back to Chase and Taub) Use cross-matched platelets. Try to find the patient some blood that's closer to his own. And get the real story on clown senior's death. Mom's hiding something. It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.
Apple juice. Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.
Nope. No realization whatsoever.
I was happy watching the fight on pay-per-view. You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.
You're trying to deflect.
My decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom. He probably would have taken other kids to the playground.
It's not my fault. Bad parenting. (House slides out of the booth and leaves)
(from the phone) Won't even trust a co-worker. What did your parents do to you?
Liver failure. Explains everything. The question is, what explains the liver failure?
More curiously, what explains the mom lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?
'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something. Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena. Almost anything works after "boxing," except the word "game."
Can you believe she used to work in the can? Nothing is tamper-proof.
You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens. You want to believe the mythical biological connection excuses being a man slut. Ow! (to the workman) I don't know why I'm starting to doubt your expertise. You do have a classified ad and a piece of metal.
Or she ripped off the band-aid too late. That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland. And I mean that metaphorically, of course.
(to the workman) This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.
I see why employers are reluctant to hire ex-cons.
Get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein. If it's a synthetic problem, more fluid will leak into his chest and his heart will fail. If it's hyperammonemic, toxins will overwhelm his body and he'll go into a coma.
There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk? (He hurries out of the office and down the hall)
(acting surprised) Oh, my God. The water. This is completely my fault. (Foreman looks extremely angry)
Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician with political contacts. I'm busy.
My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.
Since I have no intention of testing him, treating him, or cooking for him… (He looks up from his leg and sees the syringes)
The advantage of fake prescriptions is, you don't have to be a real doctor to write one.
Imaginary medicine is not my specialty. I do have an imaginary colleague who's just sent me an imaginary page. (He picks up his cane and gets up from the chair) Imagine how sorry I am. (House leaves the office)
(to Taub) Didn't answer your page last night.
And mom's determination to keep dad away, even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide.
You just lost my vote. You flip-flopped on parental rights.
Well, that very evolved of you. Don't usually see Darwinian changes over breakfast. You made nice-nice with Phil. You decided that he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all.
Hey, we're having a conversation here. No abdominal pain. (to Taub) So that must have been nice, having Ruby and the baby under one roof.
Just one life, until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you.
(to himself) Swelling. Cankles.
It's Burkitt's. Prep him for chemo.
Cankles.
If you double his placebo, he might drown. (Monroe looks at his wife) Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow.
The technical term is slow. Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat, do they contain bok choy?
Bok choy has glucosinolates, which inhibit thyroid function and account for all your symptoms.
You have a bad case of irony. The food that you're eating to stop making you sick is making you sick.
On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough to get diabetes even without ‘em. (House leaves the exam room)
No rush. ICU stands for take your time, in Latin.
That would mean that every symptom after his T.I.A. was a coincidence.
Bingo. Fits perfectly. Check the file, confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him and then completely forgot about it.
(to Mitchell) Wait. (approaching him) You sexually molested your son. Your walk, tabes dorsalis. You have late-stage syphilis, which you gave to our patient, presumably 12 years ago, which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.
After 12 years, the active infection would have died down. Everywhere except the arteries in his brain, where it could hide out from our tests. (As House talks there is flashback of the boy hitting Ben in the testicles, then a computer generated graphic of the series of events as House describes them) But when that six-year-old heckler punched him in his juggling pins, it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis. The immunosuppressant’s we gave him sent it into overdrive. The antibiotics we gave him actually started destroying the syphilis. But like pouring water on a fire, that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash, which made his immune system overcompensate. Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
Yes, Jarisch-Herxheimer is real. It sounds silly, but… Oh, you mean the… the… right.
So you made daddy go away and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.
IV penicillin and anti-TNF antibodies, he'll be fine. Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing.
No, we are not. Notify the dad's sexual partners. Notify his employer, his landlord. Notify the police.
To make him miserable or to forfeit your license?
I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make when the kid wakes up.
'Cause you're a dad. How could the rest of us possibly understand?
Evening.
How could that possibly work as a tactic? The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up. The details are just gravy.
Because you had lousy parents.
You envied their dysfunction.
That's when you started to excel. You were making it up to them. Your parents screwed you up by not screwing you up.
It's normal to be screwed up. It's really screwed up to romanticize it. I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.
It was a tactic. (he walks away)
"Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C. was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather." I'm thinking of going hang gliding.
I like their oranges and lint. What looks like kidney disease, but isn't? [hands them files] And where's Chase?
[not taking the file] Smells funny.
[picks up a red file] Patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys in less than a year. Stumped three internists and a department chair from Harvard.
Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.
I didn't say which side of the door he was on. [With a flourish, Foreman drops his file on House’s desk.] The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting. Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.
Death is a consequence, not a symptom. If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant. [He picks up one file in each hand, weighing them.]
[gets up] Right… save your asses.
I need to DDX a patient with you.
According to Foreman, they're only for DDXing people who are still alive.
Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers. I don't see creed, color, pulse.
Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case because I miss showering with Cro-Magnons than that I actually happen to find it interesting. Four-year-old kid. His kidneys died, they transfused. His lungs died. He died.
What if the chicken was the egg? What if the lung involvement came first?
Lupus.
Platitudes.
And I lose my temper when someone suggests that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal, intractable, and natural reaction to a dead child. [He turns to a man who is slumped forward in his chair, elbows on his knees.] Am I right, Emory?
They blew it, didn't they? They missed your son's rash. A faint one, on his cheek.
They're alive. Was he sensitive to sunlight?
Cold fingers and toes?
Wegener's granulomatosis. I need to examine your son.
With you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order. Find out what killed him.
You're angry because your kid died. More than that, because you don't have an answer. People need answers.
At this rate, I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself.
More like 13 minutes.
Have you ever heard of the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?
So you're taking bribes to plunder graves, and I need to show respect. [Milton doesn’t move.] I think they got the cause of death wrong. And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means I'm right.
Thank you, Igor.
[answering phone] You owe me a new pair of pants.
So… she lost the use of her arms and her innocence. A vengeful God? [He gets the lid off the sarcophagus with a clatter.] Or…
[peering through the gloom at the body] I gather from the silence that Chase isn't there.
"Nowhere"… he said cryptically. I assume you concur with the diagnosis.
Even though there are three diagnoses? And MS and vasculitis usually get better with pregnancy.
All over? [He inserts a metal tool in the corpse’s nose] I assume, from the silence, that Chase has had a Brazilian.
Question is… is this really about a woman? Or is it about something more profound?
[shining his flashlight along Drew’s body] I gather from the silence that either you all agree with Chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow. In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors. [looks at his watch] And check Chase for testosterone.
Boys, do a home search. Girls, do lab tests. I'm pretty sure that's not sexist.
Picking up dry cleaning. Filling up the tank. Violating the dead. If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company.
Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom, I'd have gone hang gliding.
There are Mees' lines on his fingernails, so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.
[burps loudly] Sorry. Vicodin repeating on me.
Working on a medical case is not a parole violation. It's my job description.
Never mind Bride of the Monster. You need to watch Norma Rae.
Before we get started, I just want to thank you all for agreeing to relocate. Um, I had an appointment in this part of town, and I obviously didn't want to miss this meeting. But, uh, thank you. I'm buying. Not literally. Hey, Emory, should we, uh, powder our noses?
Hey, did you know your ex-wife still lives right behind this place?
She finishes work at 4:00. Picks up her new kid at 4:15. Gives us about 20 minutes. I made some calls. It's amazing what people will tell you if you ask rudely enough. [points to a picnic table on the back patio] Was that table here? [Emory nods.] Some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.
We don't have a choice. This is the only way you're gonna get your answer. Does your ex leave a spare key anywhere?
Peaceful.
Made in the People's Republic of Lead Paint.
[grabbing his backpack] Let's get out of here first. We need to catch the end of our class.
Rubbing alcohol, vinegar. [He inspects the next bottle.] Not sure what this is.
Dead patients usually get a lower standard of care. Pink means lead. Orange means mercury. And rust means arsenic.
Scotch.
How does your ex-wife do it? How come she's not… angry and miserable?
Shh, shh, shh.
[pointing at the computer] He's enlightening us.
Question is, why did he want that? [looks at his watch] Clinic time.
MRA 4 TIA. ROFL.
Oh, you're right. [leaves anyway]
I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid. Losing a child… just breezed right through it.
Didn't even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.
You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.
Damn it.
I know. I deserved the slap. But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it. Apathetic hyperthyroidism. Could have kidney involvement. Could be genetic. Definitely causes apathy. I was hoping that your lack of emotion was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.
We belong to the same club.
So I heard.
So that's why you left him?
Who used to babysit Drew?
His place or yours?
So he has two types of people inside of him.
MRA was normal.
[to Iris] I found out where your boyfriend lives. When I paid him a visit, he took off. Ran in front of a car.
He's down in the E.R. right now.
How do you know I'm lying? How do you know your boyfriend's okay?
He's not an idiot.
[quietly] Okay.
Uh, y-yes, sir. I… yes, I know I told you that I had a chiropractor's appointment, but, uh, I got a flat. I know, right? So… [He reaches the porch and rings the doorbell.] …you know, don't send out the marines. I should be back on the road in a few minutes. Okay bye. [He hangs up. A man in his 60s opens the door.] Dr. James Wilson, County Coroner. I'd like to ask you about your grandson, Drew Lemaine.
What did he do when he was here? Where did he play? What did he eat?
Did you give him sidewalk chalk?
Finger paints?
A sandbox?
You expecting someone?
Temper trigger.
Which idiot did the pregnancy test?
I grabbed Park's ass. Exoplanets.
We can't actually see them… but we infer their existence because of the effect they have on the star they orbit.
Tell all the alters that they have cancer. [walks away]
Mom, dad, and mom's dad. The good news is, made me realize that you were right. I can't drop it. But now that I accept that, I feel much less conflicted. I've ruled out Wegener's, Berger's, heavy metal poison…
Feels like I'm missing something.
That is so fifth grade.
You're right.
That is ridiculous. You said, "blah blah blah blah blah, deaf ears, blah blah blah blah blah." Absolutely essential information. [He leaves.]
I asked him to meet me here for a family reunion.
I know what killed your son.
It's called Alport syndrome. It's a genetic condition characterized by kidney failure, bronchial myomas, Mees' lines, and deafness.
It's a genetic condition!
[gently] He has high-frequency hearing impairment. [Mickey looks down at her son who has not moved.] And so did Drew. That's why Drew made up his own words. 'Cause he couldn't hear properly. It's okay. Now that we know what it is, he'll need treatment, but he'll live. [to Ray, who finally lets go of House’s shirt] There are platitudes that can help you with that.
Ten clinic hours.
'Cause it's an anxiety attack. Probably because he just turned 40 and still goes by the name "Tommy". (Takes a bite)
Probably also believes that he thinks Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.
Because…
You lied?
Interesting.
What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?
(watching the coffee falling on his cup) Pain would be restricted to one dermatome. It wouldn't cross them.
No history of asthma.
(Sitting down) Which is why Arceus created a universe with 3 states of matter and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.
Look it up. And alkalinize his urine. Go search his home, talk to his wife, see if you can get her to tell us what she used.
Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it. And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.
You're right. Kids might be precocious. (Pointing Adams) You handle his house. (Pointing Chase) You handle him and his wife.
If you need help, you can take whoever you want.
Interesting.
That was fun.
(answering his phone) Don't tell me. The jealous wife in the dining room with bipyridyl herbicide.
Well, you obviously found something.
Cool.
Imperio absenti chaos regit. He's worried that "too big to fail" applies to our banks but not our government.
Because that's what every idiot with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of. (Calling) Heather Sweeney. (Heather Sweeney stands up) Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes till someone's ready to see you.
April Donaldson. (She raises her hand) Sorry. Misspoke.
Ouch.
You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.
(Simulating spitting tobacco, and talking in a Southern accent) Looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight.
Still there's only one way to settle this. Actually there's two, but we don't have enough Jell-O for the first. Mini-mental, CT, and get a hair sample to check for past cocaine use. Check his TSH levels and get a sleep study. (To Taub) Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her.
(To a busty lady waiting in the clinic) Uh, excuse me, miss, what is your name?
Huh. You don't look like a Mariel. You're up. (She smiles, and they walk to the clinic room. House shuts the blinds)
He's not paranoid. He's just stupid.
Our patient doesn't own a gun. He owns an arsenal. And I don't own a gun.
That is actually not one of the many reasons that I don't own a gun. Why would I need a gun? The only thing I own worth protecting a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.
Everyone loves fireworks.
I'm telling the truth.
If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary.
It's not resolved, is it?
You want to say it?
Yeah. It's med-speak for she's an idiot.
So it's either not sclerosis or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.
(To Adams) Now's your chance. She's leading with her chin.
No, you don't. Which means you're both idiots. Get to work. (The team exit Diagnostics, but Park follows House to his office)
[Reaching for his Vicodin. Drawer shuts] Does it matter?
If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here. But ability isn't always enough. Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.
No, this is me helping me. And amusing myself at your expense. Which brings us back to, why do you care?
People respect you. (Walks out) They just don't like you.
And yet your first thought was frostbite?
It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.
With some difficulty.
A sign that you need to take a long vacation. At least a month.
It's silver. I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.
Yeah, damn. [Pager beeps] It's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin. That normally happens every 30 days. (Starts walking out) So, I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin has got the world's largest beer can. (Exits)
I miss Claudine.
I thought that was Nadine. (Leaves the patient’s file on a desk)
Emergency page takes precedence. (Walks out)
Got your page.
Admit it.
After you admit it. (Wilson stays quiet) You know, I'm a little tired. I think I'm gonna—
Clever.
Because you're paranoid about paranoia.
Treat for GAD. Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin. (Walks away, Park follows him)
They tell you that?
It makes you feel better to think that.
There's only one way to find out. Actually, there's two but we're still waiting for that Jell-O delivery. Let me know how it goes. (Walks away)
You poor dumb bastard.
Touché.
Increase the steroid dose.
With neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way. If we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower, which means we were too late with the GAD, or death comes faster, which means we were too stupid with the infection.
Fine. But a shotgun is not gonna work. We need a sniper rifle. Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia, and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.
I changed my mind.
Do what Park says. (Hangs up. Wilson opens the bathroom door. He has a metal detector in his hand.)
Had to kill a mouse. It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.
Was there any money in it?
Can I go to bed now? Or do you want to do a cavity search? Lock up on your way out.
Unless he was still being poisoned.
Good question.
Wouldn't cause hallucinations.
Get a biopsy.
I think you should get a biopsy. (Walks to his office. Wilson is sitting there, and shows House a gun.)
That’s not a gun.
And that's not a bullet.
This proves nothing because it's not a gun. It's a prop. From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act. Look it up. She's the only woman to ever do the "Catch a Bullet" trick. I won this off her prop master in a poker game.
It's fake! It's plugged. (He takes a pencil from his desk and sticks it in the barrel. It goes about half-way.) Look for yourself. (Aims at Wilson)
It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.
Fine.
Pull the trigger.
They're blanks. You pull the trigger, I drool a little fake blood, and then I spit out the bullet that the audience thinks I caught in my teeth. Go ahead. Shoot me.
All right. I'll shoot you. (He turns the gun so it points at Wilson.)
It's not real. (He puts the pencil back in the barrel.) Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun. Which means you proved nothing. Admit it. Admit it.
All right, what?
And it feels good.
You were wrong. Don't feel too bad. We all were. His trachea wasn't swollen. It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it. It means he's not paranoid, he’s an idiot, and was poisoned. (Unplugs the device from Tommy’s throat)
Give me a Machida scope. (Park gets it) (To Chase) Hold his legs. He's not gonna like this. Because you're not gonna be able to breathe. But I need to see down your barrel. (He looks through the scope down Tommy’s throat) Good news is the poison didn't come from your wife. It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations. (Gets the scope out, plugs Tommy to the ventilator.) (To Park) Call the CDC. Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible.
We didn't guess it because nobody gets it. Instead of building bunkers, you should be getting boosters. As in routine vaccines against stuff that is actually scary.
So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?
How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?
The best dads wait two or more.
"Or something" is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree. When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?
You remember the antibiotic they gave you? Is it neomycin?
Sorry! Hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter. [to the father] Your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store. [to Jane Doe] And only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait. Which actually doesn't prove anything. The fact that you didn't burst into tears tells me that you never thought he was your dad.
Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around.
No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear. [She puts her hand to her right ear. There’s a stream of blood from it to her jaw line.] It's usually a sign of a skull fracture. Someone been using your head as a soccer ball?
Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it. [He runs his hands over her head.] No tenderness, no pain. Looks like you might actually be telling the truth about something. [He gets an otoscope from the drawer and looks in her ear.] Ear canal is fine. [checks her forehead with his hand] You don't have a fever. Pay the man. He's late for a trashcan fire.
I have no idea.
[picks up his right leg, plops it on the table and pulls up the pant leg to show his monitor-less ankle] Because I can. Also, Chris Christie's blog says the pancakes here are the best. So… what do we got on this 18-year-old with the ear bleed and the breathing problems?
Yes, she is. Says so in the file.
I cut a deal with the patient. We don't call, she doesn't bolt.
Oh, my goodness, it is! [waves his hand widely] Hi, Dean Foreman! [House picks up his phone and starts taking pictures. Anita heads for a table in another part of the restaurant. Foreman comes over.] Are you not gonna introduce us because we're married? Oh, no, wait — that's her.
In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.
Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.
Then don't believe her, and start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.
While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.
Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.
One of us is in the wrong time zone. And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.
It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor.
Yes, and your sanity. I'm multitasking.
Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their "elephant." [He gets a bottle of milk of magnesia or antacid from a cupboard and hands it to Sheldon who looks at it suspiciously.] I could add some mercury, if you want to make it more authentic.
So… What causes an ear bleed, breathing problems, and our runaway's inability to run away?
Not with normal posterior column function. [pumps the barrel] I've been waiting to do this for months. Pull! [The team members cover their ears. Someone from the range pushes a button and a clay pigeon flies from right to left in front of House. He shoots. He misses. He stares at the target as it sails away, then inspects the gun.] Sights seem to be off on this.
Well, how about the reason that there's no reason? This is working fine for me.  Pull! [A new target flies past as House shoots at it and misses again.] Well, now, that one clearly took evasive action.
Does anyone have a position on our patient's medical condition?
Pull! [another miss] [to Taub] I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss. There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.
No, I have not. But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.
[nods] Start treatment with steroids. She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again.
You wanna bet? [shows her a shotgun shell] One shot, one birdie. You hit, you make the call. You miss, never mention it again.
'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.
She took a bet that she knew she'd win. Frankly, I feel violated.
[giggles] Come on. "Poo holes."
I was giving you the gift of deniability.
[smug] No, you're not.
Uh… my phone? Oh, right. Yes, I-I did have some pictures on that. But… I also have these. [He pulls a small stack of glossy prints from his pocket and drops them on Foreman’s desk one at a time.] There's the two of you kissing over dinner. Busting a move in a night club. Is that your hand near her nether regions? Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.
Oh, of course not. There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip. But what about compromising it in a minor way? Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget. That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives. You can keep these. I got copies. [leaves]
How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the man.
[sniffs again] No, I was wrong. It's the stench of moralizing. I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.
I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned house with mold.
It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.
Go!
I paid Mr. Chips 5 bucks to take a dive.
You're on.
If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.
Franklin rules. Mr. Chips drools. [to Park] Mr. Chips's owner only feeds him on apples and bananas. Nowhere near enough vitamin A. Pay up. [Park hands over the cash.] And do an upper endoscopy to confirm for Zollinger-Ellison, after Mommie Dearest has given her permission.
Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter. Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter. Good thing you made it all official.
You didn't need to shoot yourself. I could have given you a Section 8.
It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.
Eh — compared to who? Rupert Murdoch?
Whereas you just dabble in crazy.
That's a very moving story. Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.
[joining them] If only it would explain why we've never seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.
Mildly elevated BP could put her at risk of a Berry aneurysm. Weak blood vessel in the brain gets pounded on by elevated BP, causes it to expand and contract. Causes the symptoms to come and go.
Did I mention they come and go? Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.
Why? We discussed it right here. Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to locate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair.
I pay you to think inside this room. Outside this room, I pay you to parrot.
It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers. You told the mom something you want to believe because you don't want to believe that this girl might be doing fine parent-free. Which also happens to be what the mom wants to believe.
That woman sees everything to do with her daughter through… guilt-colored glasses. It's all her fault. [He exhales loudly then starts to leave.]
Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.
I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid. Your daughter has a Berry aneurysm. She needs surgery. What she does not need is you making this or any other decision.
Then leave it up to me, and just leave.
She hates you. [long pause. Ellen finally nods, acknowledging the truth of that statement.] It's actually not such a big deal. There's plenty of kids who hate their parents. What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you. Playing the biology card doesn't change anything except where she lives. Your daughter is better off without you. So… let her be better off without you. I'm gonna do the surgery. I'll take the fallout from Social Services.
Morning!
Not for your reasons.
I'm protecting my diagnosis.
That was to show Adams that Mommie Dearest hadn't changed. I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.
Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.
I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her. Call me a softie. [They get off the elevator.] Or the mom agrees to an autopsy so I can prove it.
Which one of you is the cheap bastard? [Sheldon makes a “huh”-type grunt.] Your uniforms. They're not wool. They're polyester. Cheap polyester. Which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony. You wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, you get antimony poisoning, which caused your diarrhea and your numbness in your hands. And your collective vomiting.
Brother against brother. Now, that is authentic.
[on speaker from the observation deck] Check the ventricles.
Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst. Inject the dye.
Adams… with me.
No hypercalcemia, no elevated blood proteins.
Great ideas, if dengue fever or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly…
Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida? In a lake or a pond or an Everglade?
Family vacations kill. [He heads into the O.R.] Come with me. Don't want to explain this twice.
No, she doesn't. Your daughter has ascariasis. It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm found in feces. Animals use the canal as a potty, the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines when she went swimming… [CGI of Callie’s intestines] where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose. Maybe a dive in volleyball practice or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen. But once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs, her ear, the nerves in her legs. The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her, which started them on their journey to the esophagus and, ultimately, to the heart. A few pills of Mebendazole… She'll be fine.
Smart girl.
'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives. Now, I don't care if the people who work for me are screwed up. In fact, I even encourage it. But absolution? You do that on your own time. [pause] Or not at all. 'Cause… clearly, you suck at it.
Working late? Husband have her tonight?
Sure you are, buddy. You just lost interest once it stopped being an affair. That's why you're relieved. But don't worry — it's not gonna end here. You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else. [He opens the Vicodin bottle.] When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just… escalate things somehow. [swallows pills] At least, that's what I've been told.
True. No limp.
Yeah. Who the hell are you?
Cofield. [thinks] You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman. Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.
It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to judge the new one.
[interrupting] The facts are in the file. If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call. I'm going back to work.
The patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher. He collapsed while out jogging. He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans…
Put out an APB for a car with a man-shaped dent in the grill?
Transverse myelitis. Boring.
A little poetic license. [He takes some Vicodin.]
Taking my Vic-amins.
About a decade ago. My leg is no good at judging time.
Uhh… Yes. [takes another] And during about nine years of previous cases. [He tosses the empty pill bottle in a trash can.] My process is proven. Good things usually happen. Bad things sometimes happen.
So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen. It was nobody's fault.
Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach gym. Those who can't move their arms or legs teach us to laugh at others.
Oh, come on. Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot.
That's what I said.
No, you idiot. The patient had low opening pressure on his LP. Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.
That wasn't me. The chair squeaked.
I actually used the phrasing [enunciating clearly into the recorder] "unsquint your eyes."
But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on…
…steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.
Seriously? That's your follow-up? I eat a lot of Cheetos, I forget to wash my hands. Is my snacking really relevant to this case?
You're blaming me? You used Adams' shampoo.
It was a harmless prank. My team is made up of Type A personalities. They need something to break the tension every once in a while.
That's also true. Either way, I'm covered. If you want an accurate patient history, don't ever talk to the patient. Everybody lies. Except me. To you. Would never do that.
Don't forget the thumbscrews.
He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis… But when I was told the patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting.
Why, is that bad?
[muffled] Nobody move.
You can leave when I have an answer.
How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?
Sorry. My fault. Should have clarified. How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the patient?
Burn cream would drown him faster than water. [waves stink bomb] Well?
Me likey.
Not true.
Been used in sheep.
The guy was going downhill fast. We needed a treatment that was a… slope changer.
It was a team-building exercise.
You say pressure, I say inspire. The usual safe ideas were not gonna work. Aerosolized heparin might.
I run a diagnostic trial.
Start the patient on high-dose steroids. Multiple birds, single stone. If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured. If Adams is right, he'll spike a fever, get hypotensive, we can treat it. He can walk out of here cured. If Park is right, he goes all cuckoo's nest on us, we can cross "brain" off the list…
…diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.
What was making the patient worse was not having a diagnosis. This was the fastest way to get it. It was a perfect diagnostic moment.
Yes. My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes. [Cofield raises one eyebrow.] It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.
That's not what I said.
I don't blame either one.
My diagnostic test worked. It proved the patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.
The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.
How bad is it?
Oxygenation's at 100%. He's as ready as he's gonna be.
What was his heart rate?
Not Chase. The patient.
Park, come with me. Taub's got this.
I did listen to you. Chase didn't listen to me. At this point, being here makes you feel better. You're not helping Chase or our patient. [She turns back to the table.] Fine.
Lungs, rash, now excessive RR variability. Go.
And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing? If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dedicated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.
Would it make a difference? 'Cause I could knock her up. Autonomic dysregulation.
How about warmth? Can you feel the sheets on your skin?
No. [turns back] Forget the nerves.
Not necessarily. Think arteries. Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off. It's a clot in the radicular artery.
Prep a room for an embolectomy. Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.
Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.
Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation. There's blood in his urine bag. Kidneys are failing.
Got to be now. Foreman is transferring our guy to Princeton general as soon as there's a bed available. Says the doctors here can no longer be objective since the stabbing.
No.
We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?
I didn't do anything wrong.
He's a coworker.
Are you going to have me fired for bad manners?
[pulling a Vicodin bottle from his pocket] Could we go back on the record and get this over with?
My leg hurts.
Two explosions.
Hey, hold on.
Take him out of there.
Hey!
Wait. [catching up with her] Wait.
Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.
Yeah, well, not this time. [shot of the explosion followed by CGI of the lymph node activity.] The explosion in the classroom caused the cancer cells to break open. It's called tumor lysis syndrome. His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates, potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk. It explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, everything.
Turns out we caused that. [The elevator arrives. She gets in.] This is treatable. Okay? [He holds the elevator door open.] You have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.
Where's Cofield?
Well, I'm walking back. I'm not done testifying.
Well, I think we've heard enough.
Well, I think we've heard enough.
Coward.
You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there. You were expecting to bore us for at least half an hour. [He stands and snatches Cofield’s folder] You got my parole form in here. You were gonna send me back to prison.
Good things usually happen; Bad things sometimes happen. The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.
How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?
Your hair smelled like Adams. And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo. Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or, because there is no new girl, you were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo. So I found a way to let you know to not be late.
What fun would that be?
They decided that your being stabbed… was nobody's fault. [long pause. Chase is listening.] They're wrong. I'm sorry.
No. That was it.
 (seeing Cindy) If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.
 45 year-old truck driver, recurrent seizures.  No metabolic or structural…
 Sort of.  At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.
 I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.  (he pauses) You do work for me.  I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.
 (entering the room with Taub, Adams, and Park) Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?
 (to Wilson) You were cagey about where you were going.  And Chase being cagey in general.  Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage.  So I had Park follow you.
 (he has picked up the patient file) Patient's a nun?  You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?
 You got stabbed.  You blame me.
 But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?
 Or maybe the reverse is true.
 (leaning in close) Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.  Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.
 (calling out to Chase) Thanks for all my help.
 You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?
 Well, I'll tell you.  You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle.  Taub has decided…
 What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?
 You can do anything.  So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years.  Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.
 As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.
 Well, when you put it that way… Ascending colangitis.
 (grabbing up another soda balloon) Clinical signs can show up days before lab signs.
 This is great.  We should make this a regular thing.
 He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer.  You think his sexuality is normal?
 Let me start with an allegory.
 Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me even as you are drawn to me.  Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.
 Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.
 And the seventh?  And the eighth?  And the Nth?
 That unexpected things happen.  By definition, no class can teach you to expect them.  Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.
 (putting the paint gun down on the table) Blood clot.
 On the other hand…
 Calcium channel blocker to treat. (Chase takes up his crutches and leaves)
 Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie.  No wonder you're playing handsies with her.
 Or you're terrified of intimacy, which is why you're a serial slut.  But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft.  Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option.  That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.
 Twenty?  Thought she just got here.  (pulling back Chase’s shirt to look at the blood on his neck) That blood looks pretty dry.  Cut yourself shaving?  You know, that can happen when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you.
 Internal neck trauma, that's impressive.  It's happened to me a few times.  (raising his hand in the air) Up high.
 Do the surgery.
 He’s the better surgeon.
 Could mean lupus.
 Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up.  Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.
 And then…
 Two to the head.
 Quite a journey.  Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun.  What's the plan?
 Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game.  You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile.  You sure you want…
 Oh, my God.  Taub is interrogating the janitor.  He must think that I hired him to attack… actually, why didn't I do that?  Plaques could be confused for nodules.  Which would mean…
 Explains the shoulder and foot involvement.  Hope you practiced immaculate contraception.
 Lock and load.
 (loudly) Boo-yah!
 (sputtering as the water hits his face) Pfft!
 That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is, not surprisingly, wrong.  Abdominal ultrasound was negative.
 Wilson says it's not breast cancer.
 Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.  You're clearly not grasping at straws 'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.  I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.  It's not.  I'm sorry. (the team disperses, leaving Chase standing alone in the hallway)
 I'd say giant cell arteritis.  And I'd tell your former teammates to put her on steroids.
 Yeah.  And then what?  (Chase hurries out)
 (reading from the computer monitor) "Noradrenaline and near-death experiences."  Oh, dear.  You saw God?
 So now you're preparing a Powerpoint presentation to keep her in your garden of earthly delights.  You're an idiot.
 Because you're an idiot.  (House pops some Vicodin)  At least you two have that in common.
 You just slept with her.  Your brain is exploding with oxytocin.  You think that's gonna last through the ages?
 So are you!  She's found something she wants to build her life around.  It's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take a little ignorance with her bliss.  And you want to take that away?
 Because it's the truth, not because we're gonna live happily ever after.
 Either your relationship just blows up like every other non-magical romance, or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life.
 Anyone can screw up a life.  I never said that wasn't possible.
 If I wanted you to be like me… I would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.  You reassess your life when you've made mistakes.  You didn't.  You just got stabbed. (Chase leaves)
 … You said he worked in a sewer…
It pains me to interrupt the collegial banter, it pains me even more to listen to it continue. 38-year-old man. Spikes a fever and collapses during a speaking engagement. E.R. checks out blood volume, cardiac function, and autonomic reflexes, all normal.
The patient's philosophy makes perfect sense. Its only flaw is that it's impossible. Evolution does not work that way. You can't talk legs onto a fish. We're gonna go extinct, and we're gonna do it drinking scotch and driving muscle cars. Am I right? [He puts up both fists.] Am I— [After a long pause, Chase and Taub reluctantly do knuckle bumps with him.] Thank you.
Anyone in this room in a position to disprove that?
[reluctantly] Fine. [inhale] Now, I am hereby searching for a number two. So I'm eating a lot of bran. [fake laugh/snort] Also, I want a team leader. Someone to fill Foreman's old job.
You're right. We don't need any more structure. It's not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.
Well, if it isn't the old ball and Ukraine.
Dominika.
And you Atlantic City, where they also have gangs and pruno, but slightly less recidivism.
You're here, and I seem to remember throwing out a bunch of certified letters from immigration. I'm assuming there's a connection.
We've never taken a vacation, I don't like your family, and on top. I hear Kiev is lovely this time of year. And your mother, who may or may not be dead for all I know, misses you.
Well, I would say more not interested than afraid, but why quibble?
Need my apartment key back.
Maybe if you weren't all nag and no shag.
I'll get a copy made.
And that would be troubling if there was the slightest chance that we'd get caught.
This is what men do for the women they pretend to love. Also, she's paying me 30,000 bucks once we pass. Apparently knishes sell like hotcakes.
Afraid you're gonna have to finish your nag later.
One of those points is not absurd.
"Base" meaning foundational. Meaning things we are biologically programmed to do. Yes, perfectly natural that he stopped doing that stuff. [confidentially, to Adams] You know, that's the kind of lapse that could take you out of the running for team leader.
Comes with a 50-buck-a-week raise.
You didn't. And she could be on her way to living the dream unless the rest of you nut up and give her— [He stops and thinks.] This spiritual overhaul… did it come after a physical overhaul? A major injury of some kind?
Adams, come with me. [to Chase] You too. You guys… get a copy of that made. [He gives his key to Park.]
Did those dudes bend your ball sack like Beckham? Three years ago. The bar fight.
Oh, Dr. Adams, would you mind? [Adams turns to the door, bends over and picks up the pen. Marlene glances at her. Joe continues to stare at House.] I asked you a question. I assume you know the answer.
Wha — what has gotten into me? Dr. Chase. [Chase looks suspicious.] Just pick it up.
Nothing that The Golden Girls couldn't have handled in 23 hilarious minutes. You had a hot flash. Those guys kicked your guys hard enough to do lasting damage. You didn't even look when presented with two reasonably attractive tuchi. [loudly, to Chase and Adams] Yeah, I said it!
People generally listen with their ears, leaving their eyes free to wander. I'm guessing that your testosterone level is just below "Bieber." Do a blood test to confirm, and start hormone replacement. It's no wonder that you think women are so great. You've basically been one for the last three years.
And?
Uh… Volodymyr, Oleksiy, and… [frustrated] aaugf.
So his hose just happens to spring a leak at the same time he's in a hospital for a totally unrelated problem. [points to Chase, triumphantly] Fjodor.
I would, if it weren't redundant. Is Fedir the one who married Mykola?
'Cause I find it hard to remember things I don't give a crap about. Ergo, Dominika has one brother, and his name is Al.
Way to stay on point. It's that kind of leadership that's putting you at the head of the pack.
Well, that's settled, then. Have your underlings do an LP and get a cranio-spinal MRI to check for plaques associated with M.S. I will go tell Foreman about your promotion.
Your grandmother's kind of sexy.
Is he the guy behind "There once was a man from Kremenchuk"?
[helping] Well, then where will we have coffee? And by "coffee" I mean scotch.
I know. But there's a hot girl jumping up and down in my living room, so…
You brought a protractor?
[sits on the couch] Looks like someone is currying favor for the team leader position.
Morocco.
[hugging Dominika close] So what causes double vision on top of all the other symptoms?
Thyroid level was normal.
Quite the display of initiative and leadership.
Smooth. You let the rest of them compete, tear each other to pieces, then you swoop in with a save. Start the patient on IVIG and plasmapheresis.
Well, make it quick. We're doin' Memphis.
I was gonna go Dollywood, but I'm not sure I could pull off that wig.
That was impressive. You said that whole thing without once moving your lips. [Taub looks puzzled.] The ones you're not moving.
Actually, you won't play along with my stupid games because you're no longer a man. Still clever, though. Studies have shown that raising kids lowers testosterone levels in men. The more involved you are, the lower it gets.
Fedir is the brother she worries about the most. Ever since Luba passed. [Wilson enters.] Sorry. But this is the closest we could find to the cold, soulless offices of a government bureaucracy.
Uh, Vasyl, yes. Oksana, no. Not since she kissed Pavlo. 'Cause that bitch knew that Dominika liked him.
Can we hurry this up? I have a government to defraud at noon.
Though in fairness, the boobs were really, really helping.
It's true.
Lyme disease it is. Start the patient on antibiotics. Now I have to get home before my fake wife gets real annoyed.
Just one more thing. [He opens a box.] With this ring, I thee wedded. You left it here when you skipped town with your boyfriend.
Actually, I tried to trade them to a hooker for unspecified favors, but it turns out she doesn't accept zinc.
Yeah.
Welcome to our home.
Uh, let me see, that would be… August? No. No, July. 'Cause I remember it was right after our half-anniversary, and I forgot to put a gift in her suitcase. And… I've never heard the end of that one.
Honey, why do you do this to me? You know I'm watching my weight.
There's a simple explanation.
[on speaker phone] Oh, just chillin'. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration. Waiting on my fraud interview with my wife and my attorney. [Cut to USCIS. House, Dominika and Calvin Ayres, their attorney, sit on airport-style chairs.] No big.
I know, it sounds like a phone, but it's a timer to remind me to pee before our meeting. [He walks into the bathroom, looks and the screen and answers in a British accent.] Hello, old chap.
She'll be deported, permanently.
Tell my team to-to skip the biopsy and give the antibiotics more time.
[to Ayres] Way ahead of you.
[whispers to her] What you just said in there…
Is dance aerobics even a thing?
Do it.
Makes perfect sense. If you're the patient, and "pantywaist" is the symptom.
Now you're in here watching a motivational speech. Even your attempt to get your balls back lacks balls.
If only there was a good reason for a professional speaker to be hoarse.
It's not a good point. It's a decent point. You're doing it again. You have any other videos? Other seminars?
You bailed too early. Now I get all the credit.
Chronic hoarseness is a symptom of a condition called silent thyroiditis.
Exactly. But you were three years ago. Silent thyroiditis comes and goes. And it, in turn, is a symptom of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 3, which makes this a really bad idea. [He throws the ivermectin in the trash.] PAS 3 attacks the body's own endocrine system, moving from gland to gland. [CGI of Joe’s glands under attack.] It started in the thyroid, and probably helped along by your low testosterone, moved on to the gut.
This is incredibly relevant. Eventually, PAS 3 attacked your thymus gland. You developed myasthenia gravis, which landed you in here, and you started eating gluten, which only made things worse.
Kicked in the nuts is kicked in the nuts.
Over the past week, you've all had good moments and bad. No one candidate has prevailed. And so now, we embark upon a contest of medical strength, stamina, and skill.
If the competitor representing Australia would like to take a point deduction, he should, by all means, continue yapping.
Can I at least light the torch?
I declare open the games of the number one, number two competition. Je declare ouvert— [Chase gives him a look.] All right. Ready, set, suture!
Really, I'm just excited for the wheelchair race. You were smart not to enter. Never in, never lose. And since you no longer have stones.
Deal.
Honey, I'm home!
Kid's a blind diabetic. He's hyperglycemic hyperosmolar.
[voice] You lying sack of crap.
Not you. This time. My former BFF. [He looks over the balcony railing at the hospital lobby. Wilson and a woman are walking in.] He's S-M-I-T-B-A-W-S. Stabbing me in the back as we speak.
If anyone should happen to ask, I'm in an out-of-state medical conference until further notice.
Run an E.E.G. Blast his brain with harmonics to find out. Also, if anyone should further happen to ask, I spent the whole last year in Africa with Doctors Without Boundaries.
Evil. [He takes a Vicodin.]
[voice] Because he's handicapped. Women feel sorry for us. This cane is tail bait.
[voice] It's not environmental, it's periodontitis.
[voice] They're laughing because they know diabetes exacerbates the condition.
[voice] Like his brain. Start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics and book him an appointment with a periodontist.
Not in front of the kids, honey. [A girl hands him a picture she drew. He studies it.] Hey, add a couple of flies, toss in a dead goat or two, we might have a winner. [She nods and takes the picture back as Wilson approaches.] She gone?
Okay. [He puts down the video controller, stands and addresses the kids.] Crayons down. Line up if you wanna get paid. [The children, each carrying a drawing, move toward House who gives each one a dollar.] [to Wilson] It's the only time I ever successfully lie to my mom; is through the elaborate preparations and props.
Hey, hey, hey. I said no Transformers, Slick. [He grabs the dollar bill from the boy.] [to Dominika] Stay here until the coast is clear.
Just in case an I.N.S. guy comes in through the window.
Yeah, she didn't buy it either.
When I'm ready. Still need to get a fake passport, doctored photos, maybe a case of AIDS.
Did she say that?
Sorry I didn't call first. I just flew back from my conference.
I need your medical records and the name of your primary physician.
Well, if I didn't, I will now. [minor epiphany] You're not dying?
Having sex. Got it.
Until I hear something that takes my mind off the Jurassic schlong that I was traumatized by this afternoon.
Take your glasses off. Pupils dilated… Pulse elevated. Hallucinating?
Go back and find the drugs. You two, find out where he bought them, and then MRI his brain. Check for infections, masses, and plaques.
We'll get back to you on that.
[taking notes from his computer screen] She's not dying. She was having sex with my father. [Park snorts a laugh.] Ignore her. She's on acid.
Not the dead dad, the biological dad. The one I pointed out to you at fake father's funeral. [Thomas does look a bit like Sean Connery, if you squint.]
Well, now I've seen two. Good news is, I won't technically be a bastard much longer. We're gonna be one big, crappy family.
Yes, that is one option. [His tone says otherwise.]
I think you know the answer to that question.
If that was true, you'd have every reason to shut up. I avoid my mother because she's boring.
Even if I care what she thinks, why would I care what some sperm donor does?
Years ago. It took three times because it was so badly written.
Wilson's babysitting her. Talking about the fact that she could have permanent brain damage might bum her trip out a little bit.
A clot.
I said "a clot," not "or a clot." It's a clot. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
I counter your lupus with Behcet's syndrome.
Well, if he wasn't before, he would be by now. Confirm with an eye exam, start treatment with heparin for the clot. Interferon and steroids for the Behcet's.
How do you know about handling a bad acid trip? Friends in your gardening club been experimenting again?
You protested the war? When?
Penultimate.
If we don't do that, the next clot could cause a heart attack or a stroke. Park's way, he at least has a shot at living. CT his lungs to confirm, and up the dose.
Mother… Guy sleeping with my mother, this is Dominika, my wife.
James has persuaded me of the value of openness and honesty in relationships.
So… she gets the couch on the odd nights, and I get the bed on evens. In exchange for a federal felony, she gets a green card, and I get a live-in maid. [He smiles.]
I'm grateful you approve. [He hunches his shoulders slightly as he steels himself for this next one] You should also know that I was not in Africa the last year.
[uninterested] Uh-huh.
And… is there another secret that you want to share with me?
There's nothing you think might be relevant to my life?
I don't know. Just off the top of my head, something like I DNA-tested my dad and found that he was not my biological father — you are.
People lie. Birthmarks don't.
He's got you there, mom.
So, who's for dessert?
Let me see that image you took last night of the clot in his lung. [Taub turns a portable light box toward House and turns it on.] That's not a piece of the clot from his brain. That's the point of infection. Mucormycosis. He breathed in the spores, it's been growing and spreading ever since.
Kid's a diabetic. He already has a compromised immune system.
Treat with amphotericin B.
What else did she tell you to say?
I never liked your friend… my father.
But unlike you, I did respect him.
How long are you gonna wait until you tell me?
You don't think I saw you steal Thomas' fork from the restaurant?
For his DNA.
See, you're more me than you pretend. You had to know for sure. So you needed proof. The fact that you haven't told me can only mean…
You know what that means.
That… and… she's not as boring as I thought she was.
 No.  Don't do that.  Every time there's people in uniform in the cafeteria, they get served first.
 Do you need me to sign for this?
 Patient has no hair.  Probably means no lice.
 I think because they wanted to annoy you.  Any other conscientious objectors?
 Blowing the whistle is honorable precisely because it's not dutiful.  Sorry, you said blowing.  Maybe you were going somewhere else with that.
 Let's treat him with not medicine.
 Why?  You got 28.  You can share.
 (tossing the Tic Tacs onto the table) Pleading guilty is not honorable.  It's just stupid.
 What is honor?  Dying for your country?  Getting straight As?  Killing your daughter because she had the audacity to get raped?
 (getting up and going to the minifridge) People define honor as whatever makes them feel honorable.  It's a circle going nowhere.  Which I guess is what circles do.
 Didn't need an order for his last treatment.
 Forge it.
 Shh.  I'm with a patient.
 Sleep study.
 (looking at Wilson) I didn't say the study was voluntary.
 What, 'cause I'm sleeping in the clinic like I always do?
 Because I just woke up from sleeping in the clinic like I always do.
 Sorry.  What did you say?
 I didn't forget.  I was sleeping, in the clinic—
 For what?  Where's this coming from?
 While having you juggle my jewels sounds interesting, there's no such thing as friends with benefits. It always gets weird.
 You're forfeiting?  'Cause if you can't play the game and work…
 She's right.  You're an idiot.  Try again.
 Where's that?  Stickford-upon-anus?
 Don't interrupt Dr. Taub.
 They were clearly armed insurgents, and anyone who claims or proves otherwise is a traitor.  No rash or back pain.
 Adjectives matter.  Hate nurses, love naughty nurses.  Taub, pitch again.
 It's your turn.
 Taub, pitch again.  Now.
 Someone tell him he's wrong.
 (plopping down on the couch) Sarcoidosis it is.  Treat with steroids.  Then come right back here, 'cause I'm not gonna rest until I've made orphans of all your virtual children.
 Oh, good.  Taub's cured the patient.
 Bathroom's that way.  You just ran in from that way.
 I believe you.  I'm gonna fix it.
 Speaking of which…
 It'd be too hard to get the prednisone concentrations right.  No one fixes anything unless they have a compelling reason.
 Cholesterol embolization.
 That you pilfered my poo-poo?  Yeah, I was thinking, it would be less awkward for all of us if we could just pretend that never happened.
 Thank you for getting us back—
 What's the opposite of "thank you"?  I'm pretty sure it ends in "you".  I know my body.  I'm fine.  Methemoglobinemia.
 The test is accurate.  The diagnosis isn't.  Sample was obviously contaminated with other foods interacting with my liver enzymes.  Now could we talk about the sick patient?
 And the symptoms I'm not exhibiting?  Jaundice, ascites, fetor hepaticus.
 Park's right.  Treat the patient with Heparin.
 Blurry vision… headache, a bit of nausea, and dizziness.  I am com-pletely baffled.
 Hop on one foot and sing the iCarly theme song.  Like you don't know it.
 Damn it, man.  Can't you see I'm doctoring?
 If you want to talk to me, you can buy me a sandwich in an hour.
 Heard enough.  Just never could figure out the "breathe air" part.  Next year, stick to whiskey.  Or at least stay away from week-old green beers.  A lot less likely to contain tartrazine-laced green food dyes for which you apparently have an intolerance.  Once you break the seal, it'll be out of your system in 48 hours.
 What are my choices here?  If I tell you I'm fine, you won't believe me.
 If I ignore you, then you'll just ignore my ignoring.  Which is rude, frankly.
 If I tell you I think I'm sick and I need your help and we need to set up a time to talk about it, you'll just assume I'm lying.  Again, rude.  Also hurtful.
 I really don't have a choice here, do I?
 (to the MP) I'm on the list.  (referring to Wilson) But he's not.
 Well, if you're right, that's not gonna be all that long.
 (to the MP who is searching him) Do it slow.
 Well, considering the only people allowed in this room are your doctors and your family… I'm your long-lost cousin Ralph.  So glad to finally meet you.
 It's gonna be at least two hours until we can tell if the Heparin's working.
 You know, my father taught me that it's dishonorable to interrupt someone when they're reading.
 So was it worth it?  (He puts the magazine back on the table) Best case, you spend the rest of your life in Leavenworth.  Worst case, you spend the rest of your life here.
 They got justice?  Do they know that?  What if only ten people had died?  Four?
 What if they just maimed a few guys?  Would that have been worth it?
 Your hair turned gray in three days.
 Loss of hair color indicates an autoimmune condition, likely Grave's disease.  Hyperthyroidism leads to a hypercoagulable state, which causes thrombosis.  Start him on antithyroids.
 I want to reject our current diagnosis because I think we're wrong.  And treating for wrong diagnoses can result in side effects like death.
 I haven't read any journal articles proving that veterans have a higher incidence of depigmentation.  Of course, that could be the hepatic encephalopathy talking.
 So you all just want to ignore the new symptom?
 (to the cashier) Small soda.  Grave's it is.  Start him on antithyroids.
 Bold move.  You've gone from speculating I'm sick, to acting like I'm dead.
 Why don't you start by not trusting your own.
 Anything you have to say to me, you can say to them.  It's only fair.  Cause
 Well, I would say that that was an incredibly stupid mistake but apparently I'd have to clear that opinion through Foreman first.
 Taub.  Loyalty issues in his personal life.  Makes sense that they'd cross over into his professional one.
 The patient's infection is an inherently less interesting puzzle than the stab wound to my back.
 No.  I don't mean about dengue.   I have no idea.  Taub's only confessing because he wants us to focus on the patient.
 The next person to confess is fired.  Or Spartacus.
 And then… there's Park.  The only one who didn't confess.  The same cowardice that makes someone unable to move out of mommy and daddy's home might also make someone a tattletale.
 And it's malaria.
 And has done for ten years.  That's the equivalent of 5000 generations of the Afghan mosquito, anopheles gambiae.  That's plenty long enough to develop a resistance.  Anopheles, by the way, is Greek for "useless."
 (to Foreman) And was I also right that it was a stupid idea?
 I took St. John's Wort to alter the way my liver metabolized acetaminophen.  Then some n-acetylcysteine just to finish it off.
 I did it to save lives.  God, I wish I could rationalize that one.
 What makes you think I haven't already?
 To be continued.  I need to brilliantly cure a patient.
 No hair usually means no lice.  What we didn't account for was that it wasn't your hair.  Tea was not the only thing that your Afghani neighbors shared with you.  I'm sure they were generous enough to let you sit on their furniture, which was infested with rat lice.  You have typhus.  Caused the vasculitis and explains all your other symptoms.  But here's where it gets interesting.  One of those symptoms, a lawyer might argue, was leaking the tape.  There are psychiatric issues associated with typhus.  If you change your mind, plead not guilty, you've got a case.
 You're not doing this for honor.  You're doing this to please your father.  And the pathetic thing is that the man you're trying to please never existed.
 Traitor.  You've been avoiding me for two days.  'Cause, when I stranded you behind the barricades, you went straight to Foreman.
 I've been an ass my whole life, I can't get rid of you.
 Huh.  Your whiny righteousness has the stench of sincerity.  Fine.  I have to punish my whole team so that one of them will step forward.
 (sighing) Damn.  Now I'm gonna have to punish my whole team so that one of them will step forward.
 Yeah, but I meant it this time.  First time I was just testing you.  Either you were gonna genuinely confess or falsely confess or actually…
 His name's li'l Chase.  He's a rat.  You're a rat.  Get it?  Taub confessed to telling Foreman to protect the patient.  Adams confessed to protect Taub.  But your confession was just piling on.  There's no rational reason for you to have done it.
 If that were true, why are li'l Chase's li'l cousins scurrying through your apartment's floorboards right now?
Capacity crowd is on its feet. Five seconds on the clock. Ah. How is it possible for one man to be blessed with so much skill? Ahhh. [The imaginary crowd roars]
[distributing copies of the patient file] Birthday present for someone in pediatric oncology. 22-year-old enforcer with hemoptysis.
No, he's a superhero.
Nice conclusion to which the E.R. already jumped 18 hours ago. [he shoots] Short man equals bullied child.
Chase, CT the patient. Check for sarcoid. [He tosses Chase one of the hockey players from the game.] Adams, sputum cultures and serologies for psittacosis. Taub… I'd tell you why I think your theory is not just wrong but ill-conceived, but it's more fun to prove it by having you check the stool for blood. And while we wait for the stool fairy, I'm a man down, so you want to drop your pants and hit the ice.
Neighbor's baby again?
Hmm.
I just said, "hmm."
Which one of us is analyzing the word "hmm" here?
Apology accepted. However…
It's not the crying that's keeping you awake. The sound of a needy child is stirring your paternal juices.
Explain the stains on your shirt. You're lactating. The fact that you're the only fruit on your family tree is getting to you.
You're not supposed to feel bad when you dodge a bullet. It's like you got survivor's guilt.
 Remember the falconer?
You dated two falconers? Yes, Beth. The night the two of you split up, you came around to my place, wallowing in self-pity and tequila. You passed out. She called that night, asked me to give you a message. She said she was pregnant… Which, God and Planned Parenthood willing, means you are the father of an 11-year-old. [Long pause as Wilson takes in this information.] I told you the next morning… hypothetically. I asked you how you'd feel if Beth had gotten pregnant, and you said, and I quote, "It would be the worst mistake of my life."
Just as well.
[to Adams] Well, that was incredibly unprofessional. Well, it was really Taub's fault. [Taub stops smirking]  If you're not prepared to slam her into the boards, she's got no reason not to go after you. Might I suggest pulling her jersey over her head first?
Note that the person who wants to search the home didn't sleep in one last night. You have the imprint of a seatbelt buckle in your cheek.
She hit you with a seatbelt?
All we really know for sure is it was his evil job that caused the problems.
Maybe. Let's take a look at the instant replay. [He turns the computer around and plays a video of Szabo checking Wallace.] This is the hit that precipitated Booby Orr's fight. Dirty or clean?
Absolutely. Maybe she's as biased as you. Or maybe the entire league is. [He hands Taub a document.] After review, the league disciplinary commissioner ruled the hit illegal and dangerous and suspended the player for three games. Adams and Taub, run antibody titers for lepto. Chase and Park, check out the home, the locker room for booze, steroids, and Taub's objectivity.
Why don't we just assume that you're not the dad? [Wilson takes out his phone and shows House a picture. House studies it for a moment.] Either you're the dad, or she cheated on you with your dad.
He's bitter, not mentally handicapped. Who knows what Beth told him about you? At worst, you're a rapist. At best, you're a rapist.
Raised by a lunatic mother and abandoned by his father. Oh, I know! Squirrel handcuffs. You think he's gotten any of those?
Because you were pining for a kid, and you deserved to know that you already had one. But your parental cravings are more theoretical than applied. You want vicarious immortality more than you want a lifelong burden.
He's a kid. Best you can hope for is he's a nightmare.
So your theory is that his aggressive behavior caused his aggressive behavior. He's not depressed. He's just bummed because he knows he's a talentless moron who's only one lost fight away from being a barista. I understand that can get to a guy after a while.
You don't want to save his life. [joining them] You want to kill his career.
Yet.
Why? Are you trying to sleep with her? 'Cause the simpler technique is just to ask.
Mm, no. Th— mm. No, that doesn't fit.
Guilt?
So it's guilt. Chase convinced you to leave mommy, and now he feels responsible. No MRI. Do a psych eval. If he doesn't start weeping again, send him home.
[voice] Meaning you see what you want to see. [Taub turns on another monitor. House is getting the MRI.] Unless, of course, Chase is an idiot, and I do have brain damage.
Chase? Can you get me out of— Ohh… Hello?
The good news is, it's isolated ophthalmoplegia, which means you didn't have a stroke. [House replaces the eye patch.] Bad news is, Taub was right. You're still sick. [to Taub] I said "right," not "competent." Bursts your CTE bubble. You're going to need a whole new theory to keep Uncle Jesse and his Olsen twins on the bench.
So he was trash even before he was trash? You curious about what he wanted?
He was doing what he always does — sticking up for the little guy. He told me to apologize to you, or he would… excrete down my throat. I'm paraphrasing. [Taub looks puzzled.] So if he should ask, I was a gentleman, or I will excrete down your throat.
I think you're right. Thus confirming my objectivity. Start the treatment.
Miserable yet?
Which means he doesn't need you. So why don't you get out while the butterfly effect is still in the cocoon stage?
You don't make an 11-year-old dinner. You give him a jar of peanut butter.
'Cause he's a gutless placater, just like his dad.
This is a terrible idea.
Yes. 'Cause of the statement "we like each other." You've known him 25 minutes. All you know about him is that he'd lie about a quinoa salad, whatever the hell that is.
No target rash or cardiac involvement. [to Chase] Roomies with benefits keeping you up?
Is that two separate events?
Okay, yeah. Now this is interesting. We'll get back to the patient in a second. Your issue is the same as Wilson's, except… you're haunted by the pitter-patter of tiny skanks. You don't feel guilty about getting Park thrown out of her home. You feel guilty about all the women that you've screwed over. My mother needs 1,000 bucks for snow tires.
So it was something he ate. How innocuous. You've overcome your bias by reversing it. The only problem is that being in love with a patient is just as judgmental as being in hate. We didn't find any contaminated—
As if to prove my point, last time you said there wasn't enough time to test prior to a more dangerous treatment.
Different emotion. Give him the antitoxin.
Every little girl wants a pony till they have to clean up after it.
The only relationship you haven't quit on has been with me.
[stares at him, serious] That's not even close. This is the rest of your life. You screw this up, you don't get to run away. You get to ruin both your lives. This is a bigger responsibility than any you've ever taken on and screwed up.
I am now accepting long shots.
Pretty sure we can.
All of us? Those who love him, those who hate him, those who don't give a crap about him or you—
He's not your friend.
He never had your back. He didn't insist that I apologize to you. He asked me to take you off the case. [Taub takes in this information.] Biopsy his brain.
Agreed. So why shouldn't I take you off all my cases?
You work for me.
Pretty sure I am, dickwad.
Yeah, I get it. There's a long list of reasons not to like you.
You little Hebe. Here's some ideas for you. You screwed up. You kept on screwing up. Everything you said is true, except… it doesn't mean you walk away. You just learn to trust nothing. Everything you think you feel, everything you think you know. Question every call, play through every whistle.
You can trust light bulbs.
It was my metaphor that solved the case. Put him back on plasmapheresis. He'll be fine. Nice save. Didn't quite make up for being a sieve the rest of the game.
Ex-girlfriend's baby again?
Well, it's only six or seven years. Unless he can't get into college, in which case, it's more a matter of your life expectancy.
I have an idea… that can make this entire problem go away.
None of that is true.
You were regretting not having kids, so I gave you one… thereby rendering you regret-free. It's a priceless gift.
Well, it's not priceless 'cause he charges SAG minimum.
Can you do an Australian accent?
Found her on Facebook.
Nothing. She's still pissed at you.
Pass the bacon.
Nobody likes prosciutto.
35-year-old male cries blood, and he's not vampire Bill. Go!
What, her? [A red-haired voluptuous woman holds a cup and walks to House to give it to him.]
Yeah, my favorite companion is retiring from "companning." So I'm interviewing replacements. Thank you… Butterscotch. Is that a family name? [She stands beside him and waits. In the hallway, there is a lineup of similar women waiting.]
Sex and work? I'm not a savage. [He takes a sip of what is in the cup. He seems surprised.] I asked for a cappuccino.
No, cappuccinos got a nice, stiff foam on it. This is wetter than… oh… almost slipped there. Well, thank you, Ms. Scotch, but poor foaming's a deal breaker. Could you ask the next candidate to come in? [She exits. House is looking at his notes and some “resumes” and waits for the next one to come in.]
Take a seat, Fawn. And tell me, what's your favorite Woody Allen movie? [The team stares at House and the woman.]
Sex is a given. They're hookers. [He takes notes.] Defend your choice.
Rerun the patient's blood panel and get a CT venogram of his head. Let's see which one of you is right. [The team leaves and House turns to the next applicant.] How are you with small appliance repair?
This is the talent portion of the interview.
What if I'm busy? [He turns to the hooker behind him.] Have you got anything else?
Well, since you have nothing of relevance to report, I assume that you're here to toss your panties in the ring.
Can you repair a blender?
Uh, imagine a "vanilla Gonzalez," but from the other side.
I'm about to make a decision, but there's still time for you to sneak under the wire.
If you did, you'd probably talk to them more. Guy loves an imaginary being who's never going to respond to him. He's no crazier than millions of churchgoers.
You do understand the irony here? Every person in this room has a sex doll. At least the patient has the stones to be honest about it.
Your doll is your kids. Yours is your parents, yours is your charity. All excuses for not being in a relationship.
You don't go looking for the right person. You just shack up with whoever's in the room, and then you get surprised and/or divorced when it doesn't work out. I'm surprised you haven't asked Adams out yet.
You'll bail.
Can we stop trying to argue the premise and move onto figuring out why it is that you're all social morons?
You're right. That is stupid. [He gets up to leave.]
Dude's banging a sex doll. A festering cesspool of bodily fluids and associated bacteria. Swab her out and find out which one. [He leaves the office.]
I need you. Please don't quit. You're the only hooker I know who can tune a piano. If it's about the money, then I can up you to three nights a week.
No. He… If he accepted who you were, he would not be making you give up your career. Women need their own identities, their own livelihoods. Otherwise, why was I smoking all those Virginia Slims?
Oh, I get to play Solomon. Cut the doll open.
Exactly. Ask him for consent. If he says yes, then we get to go hunting bacteria. If he says no, there's no need because he's crazy, and we need a different theory. See ya. Gotta go build a temple.
All I need is to break up one marriage. You've broken up three of your own. You're like the Stephen Hawking of killing relationships. Actually, no, Stephen Hawking is the Stephen Hawking of—
Your computer is off.
Why do you assume that marriage is better than hooking? We don't know anything about the guy. He could be a serial killer.
You looking at the apartment with those or the transit of Mercury?
He's an accountant. How late do you think he's going to party?
Yeah.
Probably. But he's not the one we're after. [He is still holding the phone to his ear but not really paying attention to it.]
Oh! How rude of me not to situate you. I'm doing Emily a favor. We're going to track her fiancé until Dominika can seduce and expose him as the lying cheater I need him to be.
Oh, you know, the noblest gifts are the ones we give anonymously.
No neurological symptoms? I knew your bleeding heart would bring you around. Too bad it's also taking you off the market. And by market, I mean Chase. Come on, buck up, Chase. There's always Park. Unless… How did band practice go?
Does she look like she's lying?
You're terrified of dating because… a previous relationship ended because your latent rage made you vicious in arguments. Or—
Interesting. Taub feels confident enough to turn the spotlight on himself. It's almost as if he wants me to ask… what's her name?
Nice choice. Since you got two families to "therapize."
So it was just a one-night stand.
Mazel tov. Great relationships often start with snap decisions aimed at proving me wrong.
Silicone deposition. That could work. Start him on plasmapheresis. Now, turning to Adams, my theory is tripartite—
Want to hear my thesis? It's kind of interesting.
Yeah, if you want Adams to hear, you might want to not stand so conspicuously far away.
Unexpected. I actually thought you might agree with my theory. Because that would mean nothing's your fault. You fell into relationships based on proximity. Of course they failed. [Chase sits down at the table.] But I guess I was wrong. You picked perfect women. You just screwed it up.
Adams suggests that we all sleep together, and your issue is high prices?
Yes, I'm 99% sure that you're right, but I would never forgive myself—
I guess we don't need to ask how your dating life is going.
Fibrosis fits. Start the patient on steroids and find out how he pimped his ride.
Because I don't know the answer. [He gets up and heads for the elevator. Wilson happens to be walking by and stops to talk to House.]
Can't. Marriage to destroy.
"Okay" as in passive-aggressive reverse psychology? Or as in depressed resignation
Expand.
Contract.
So, passive-aggressive reverse psychology. Got it. [He enters the elevator and the doors close.]
Try not to come on too strong, okay? Just get to know him a little. Ease into it.
True. You could just walk up and stick your hand down his pants, but I heard there's a middle step.
Why, I hope you're speaking out of some deep kind of moral relativism because—
You're not Emily's fiancée.
So let me get this straight. I'm being dumped by a hooker… who's worried about my feelings?
Half your clients are married. And you're a hooker.
Oh, my God. The marriage, it's a sham. The only really thing about it is the green card she's going to get at the end of it. So, if you want to get the meter running…
It's not a marriage. It's a felony.
Like that?
Yes… if by "tea," you mean salted tap water. And by "drink," you mean poured up his nose. His girlfriend didn't just leave him with a broken heart. She left him with a neti pot. It's an Indian method of… clearing the sinuses during allergy season. Also known as now. [As House speaks, we see glimpses of the past: Henry is filling the pot with tap water and leaning over the sink, he puts water in his nose.] The distilled water can act as a snot flushing system. With tap water, it can act as an amoeba delivery system to the fluids around the brain. Start him on metronidazole. If he's lucky, he'll get to see his plastic children walk down the aisle. [Adams leaves the room.]
So I see.
Yeah, I thought I'd take a break from the whole hooker thing.
I'm… gonna go to bed. See you tomorrow.
I must've been in the shower. Then I had to moisturize.
Actually, I had to moisturize twice. Dominika made oysters Rockefeller last night.
Stress induced panic attack. Tell the parents to lay off the grades. The world needs fry cooks too.
Have you seen Wilson around?
SUNDS — sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome, aka BS name for “no one's figured out why they died.” Over 100 in the early '80s. Only male. Only Hmong. Healthy right up until the moment they died in their sleep.
Sleep apnea wouldn't have caused breathing problems after he woke up. What did you dream of?
But you're certain that they're insignificant. Defensively so.
You were defensively defending science.
Okay, Chase and Park, start IV antibiotics for pneumonia. Taub and Adams, go check the home for toxins.
Right… 'cause for a moment there, I thought you were uncomfortable around Chase because you'd had a nocturnal Australian. [She looks uncomfortable. Taub, Adams look at Chase who looks at Park.] You can go with whoever you want. But all of you, read all of these files.
I had a dream.
Relax, I'm a doctor. Your spectacular breasts mean nothing to me.
I had sex with Dominika.
It wasn't literally sex. Technically, it was flossing. You know, teeth, testicles. I think the symbolism is pretty clear.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, kid in V-tach. Tell me about the luau in his bedroom.
Hasn't he heard of Star-69?
How many of the other files showed malignant arrhythmias?
Forget the E.P.
How many of the other files—
[nods] Do an echo to check the pericardium. See if you can find any cardioactive toxins in the home samples.
No, no, please. No need to apologize for your earlier behavior. [He opens a bag and drops a plastic take-out container on the desk.] Floss was mint probably because of this green G-string she hangs up to dry in the bathroom.
You might want to forward your calls. You do not want the Reader's Digest version on this. There was a very tight hygienist's uniform, suggestive use of the water sprayer—
Yeah, sorry. Idiot delivery guy forgot them.
You've gotten to know me pretty well.
Yeah… that's actually why I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah.
No. [Long pause. House looks away and down before reestablishing eye contact.] Since we hadn't heard anything, I–I called, and they said it's gonna be a couple weeks, maybe a month till they finalize their decision.
Yeah, I know. It sucks.
And you will be. Absolutely. In the meantime…
Have you ever shot anyone?
I've got one. Dang tong lee twah. It means "you're a bunch of pathetic idiots" in Hmong. [He turns his laptop around so they can see the screen with the computer translator on it.] Or it doesn't. But you wouldn't know because none of you speak Hmong. Kid, on the other hand, is presumably fluent in gibberish.
He heard what he wanted to hear, 'cause if his grandson really is possessed, that means his son really is possessed, which is a giant step up from being a sledgehammering psychopath.
[nods slightly] Interesting.
Interesting that you keep falling for it when I say “interesting.” The scleroderma part was idiotic — we'd have seen skin involvement. The interesting part is that you and Park agree, but you're not able to look at each other.
Good, now lick your lips.
Cha mo tie mia boo chang. It's Hmong for “get an MRI to confirm.”
Apparently, there are some things about you I don't know.
And you're just telling your husband now?
Absence of evidence on an MRI, which my team has mistaken for evidence of absence.
You're a dead-eye shot and enjoy reading quantum physics on the crapper?
Better image. Thank you.
More likely — and by “likely,” I mean “rationally” — it's the other way around. His brain felt the pain in his neck and created the dream to explain it.
Well, short answer is—
Is that right, Dr. Park? Did you wake up this morning experiencing physical changes? It's medically relevant.
Sure. We could also start acting like walls don't mean anything, but then we'd hurt our noses. You've been taking the high road. You haven't been teasing in an obviously teasable situation because you know it does mean something. She hates the dream because it makes her feel vulnerable. You love the dream because it makes you feel superior. The poor lass who can't help but fall sway to your charms, and you're bestowing upon her the gift of illusory irrelevance.
That is so weird that you and I had the same dream. I assume yours also ends with me achieving ecstasy while simultaneously placing third in the New York City marathon.
I'm a realist. Liver failure can cause gibberish from encephalopathy, constipation, bruising, and breathing problems.
So let's hit his liver. Get a biopsy.
Cool. So the one thing we know for sure is he was not levitating.
So many questions… starting with why did Chase address his comment to someone who wasn't even in the room? Hocus pocus, on my feet you idiots must focus.
Uh… uh… extreme… drained…
Of course not. He's the lovely assistant. 'Cause grandpa pig sticker is waving the wand. Middling with… is Chase trying to avoid Taub, or is he trying to prove that he's not avoiding Park?
Tetanus wouldn't cause that kind of breathing difficulty. And ending with… if Chase is trying not to avoid Park, why is he doing this today and not yesterday?
It's a long shot, but at least it has the benefit of being rational. Go pump up his electrolytes and start beta-blockers. And good news for Park: I think Chase had a sex dream about you.
I agree. And since we're establishing a new policy of “What the hell, we'll try anything,” I'd like to hire Shakira to belly dance while singing Waka Waka.
True. But in the long run, I think you'll be happier having our lawyer declare her unfit. That way you won't be ratifying superstition over science, and I'll still be working here.
I'm sorry. I should've told you.
What's the letter?
That's too bad.
I could stay.
Who cares? Mom's given up, why shouldn't I?
All the more reason why we should shut down. We cure this kid now, crazy grandpa and his magic beads get all the credit.
Since when do I care about this kid? All I care about is sending mommy out into the world having faith in faith. Kid's better off dead. As soon as she's done appeasing the gods, let's talk.
It can't be Kawasaki. Echo would have shown it. But a patent ductus arteriosis—
Maybe he has. Maybe he had an infected ductus, which we inadvertently treated with antibiotics.
I'm just saying, it's consistent.
Which means there's seven people in the world who fit the diagnosis.
Well, maybe PDA is more common than we thought. With idiot doctors like you—
No, worst-case scenario is you piss me off—
I think I'll stick with the fluids tonight, thanks.
I'm not sulking.
Either religion is killing a kid, or I am. [She looks at him for a moment then slides over and straddles him.] What are you doing?
I'm not gonna answer that.
I'll get it.
I'm sorry.
Adams defied me. There's one more zealot in the world. [sits on the couch] And Dominika moved out. She was fun. She was hot. She fixed my blender. That is not a metaphor. You know any good fake divorce lawyers? I am surprisingly depressed by this.
You were a little short with me the other day. You do need an excuse. Cancer may be overplaying it.
 (entering the room) Is that our precious little bundle of tumor?  They grow up so fast, don't they?
 How do you think?
 Actually, that would have been easier.  No, I followed you.
 I'm not here as a doctor.  I'm here as a towering pillar of strength.
 No.  How many times have I told you I wanted to be alone and you've made yourself a pain in the ass?  I owe you.  My word, not a word.
 (mixing himself a drink) My best friend has cancer.  Cut me some slack.  Also, spring break.  I'm on vacation.  (House puts an umbrella in his drink and settles back on the couch) Although looking at you now, I can tell the wet t-shirt contest is probably gonna suck.
 I agree with Wilson.
 No, I meant about the ball-less part.  Explains the office.  (House leaves the office)
 B-9.
 (peeking around the pizza box lids) I sunk your battleship?
 Good. Now that you're sufficiently buzzed, what was the reason behind you freaking out on Kondo?  Are you scared?  In denial?
 Okay, well, here it is.  Kondo is right.  You should be in radiology right now.
 Every day you wait, our pal toomie is growing larger in your chest.  If you want to live, stop screwing around and do something about it.
 (coming into the office) We don't have to have sex.  Sometimes it's nice just to cuddle and talk.  Me first.  (He turns to face Wilson who is now paying attention) You don't want a second opinion.  You're already on your fifth.  You got Evans at Mercy, Shaw at County, Foster at Johns Hopkins.  And every one of them has given you the same advice.  You're nuts.  You don't just want chemo.  You want a dose so high, there's a one-in-three chance it'll kill you outright.  Question is, why didn't you tell me?  Because you knew I'd stop you.  Which means you've already found someone insane enough or desperate enough to give you what amounts to a death dose of chemicals.  (House wanders back behind Wilson’s desk) But who would be that stupid?  I'm thinking that the who, is you.
 (holding up the bag) Where exactly were you planning on killing yourself?  'Cause I don't think Foreman is gonna let you do it here.
 Statistically, this treatment has about the same chance of killing you as the thymoma does.  But a hell of a lot faster.
 (walking toward the door) You're an idiot.  And the odds say you're gonna die.
 We'll do it at my place. (He leaves, shutting the door behind him)
 (picking up his drink) To stupidity.
 (pausing) Mm, not quite done.  To muscle aches, spasms.  To your joints feeling like they're being ripped out and replaced with shards of broken glass.
 Your stomach fills with bile.  When you vomit, it feels like someone's forcing a white-hot hammer down your esophagus, tearing your flesh.  Blood's dripping down the back of your throat, choking and gagging you with the slick, coppery taste of burnt pennies.
 If you did, we wouldn't be sitting here.  Day two: Your white blood cells are gone, opening up your system to attack.  Your temperature skyrockets.  One second, your skin feels like it's on fire.  The next second, it's entombed in ice.  Every pain sensor in your body is firing at the same time until agony isn't even a word or a concept — it's your only reality.  You hallucinate.  You dream of death.  And then the race begins.  Can your body claw its way back in time before the hostile organisms and parasites claim you permanently?  Win, you live.  Lose, you die.  (He takes a sip of his martini) Now, what are we doing here, Wilson?
 Promise this'll taste just as good coming up as it did going down.
 If you're gonna say that you've always been secretly gay for me, everyone always just kind of assumed it.
 That's not gonna be an issue.
 Not me.  I've already identified a couple of spots to dump your body if this goes south.
 It does have a nice access to the lake.
 Muscle spasms already?
 Good news.  Takes most people two bags to get to that stage.  You're way ahead of schedule.
 That hasn't stopped you before.
 (coming out of the kitchen) And in this scenario, are your loving wife and kids holding the life support cord, or are they thumbing through your will?  (House stops behind the couch) I'm in it, right?
 You have everything you need right here.  We both do.
 Painkiller.  Industrial strength.  Level: Awesome.
 We're on vacation.
 Not yet.  It just feels that way.  Are you okay?  I mean, apart from the pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps?
 Here's another one.  You look good.
 It's down to 1,000, still dropping.
 We're out.  You've been using my personal supply of painkillers for the last eight hours.
 I've got enough stashed around here for a minyan.
 Just remember they're a gift.  So it's rude to keep throwing them up.  Found that out with those candlesticks you got me.
 You lost a contact?
 They're called adult diapers for a reason.  Use it.
 (trying again to help Wilson up) It's okay.  I'm a doctor.
 (gingerly sitting down on the floor beside Wilson) The universe doesn't care—
 Sound advice.
 You'd still have cancer.
 Okay, your heart rate's up, BP's tanking.  White blood count's
 I don't have the equipment or the meds to handle this.
 (clearly worried) That was the deal when there was an "or".  You can't win this.
 Okay, I promise.
 (nodding) Been fighting a cold lately.  Seven to ten days for the swelling to go down.  Then we rescan and schedule the surgery.
 You talked a lot.  I stopped listening after you confessed your fear of dolphins.  Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches?  My leg is killing me.
 Everybody lies.
 At least I don't have cancer.
"Staring death in the face has changed my life." What a cliché.
Your scan's in three days. Tell me this isn't just you killing time until you find out if your cancer's gonna kill it for you.
The years have not been kind to David Cassidy. [He pushes the button to call the elevator.]
Or you've made sure that your patients are well-covered, the car is a rental, and while waiting to get Julie Christie's autograph, you'll adopt a puppy.
Interesting. Cotard delusion. Also known as "walking corpse syndrome." Disconnect in the amygdala convinces you that you're secretly dead. Case solved. [He closes the file, hands it to Foreman and gets up to go to the coffee machine.] Rendering it… What's the past tense of "interesting?"
Wilson's scan is at the end of the week. If his kick-ass chemo shrunk the tumor to an operable size, he'll live. If it didn't, he'll die.
Other than the prayer circle, what is there?
I have a dental appointment. That I'm going to make now. [He reaches for the phone.]
Not worth listening to you whine about your feelings and fears for three days.
People don't change. You are a person, ergo, pass.
Stimulant psychosis. How many times do I have to solve this case?
I'm–I'm impressed. Not by that. But by your real effort to maintain the facade. It's been almost an hour, and there's been no mention of the elephant in the car.
Uh-huh. In three days, you're gonna find out if you live or die. You don't want to talk about it.
So, we're gonna talk about it, but because I want to.
You are hard-wired to talk about it. It's how you cope, it's who you are.
I thought your porn name was Rusty Packard.
Can Kyle drive stick?
If we had a phone, we could've found somewhere a little less charming.
This is not about you not wanting me to have a phone. You're weak. You knew that you'd backslide and spend your time talking to teary ex-wives and your parents, trying to make them feel better about you being sick. [The waitress approaches them.] Bacon burger with fries looks awful. I'll have that.
This place doesn't take credit cards.
Come on, you got this! You got this! Come on! [A look at the clock: 25 seconds left for Wilson to finish his meal.]
You've got this. Come on, home stretch, Kyle, home stretch!
Now, don't chew, just swallow. Just muscle it down!
Yes! Yes! Oh, you magnificent bastard! [He hugs Wilson.]
Must be nice to be puking for the old-fashioned reasons.
Shouldn't we try a twosome first?
Oh.
No, you don't.
Kyle's only one day old. He doesn't know what he wants. I don't want to think about consequences. I don't want to think about — I don't want to think about anything. I just want to… do. [House gives him a resigned look.]
okay. I need you to do exactly what I tell you.
Well, that is the cost of cowardice. Should've gone for the real thing.
A, it is only cheating if you don't have cancer, and B, it's Wednesday afternoon. Pickings are slim, and more importantly, sober. The cancer cut is the surest way to the pity pooty party. [He puts a baseball cap on Wilson’s head. Then he looks intensively at a young woman sitting at the bar.] One down, one to go.
She's empathetic.
Gave me a cancer rate.
You still haven't. It's my treat. It's either that, or you find two very open-minded women to fall in love with you in the next hour. [Wilson looks at his watch, then notices the bartender.]
Seems female.
My friend is dying of cancer.
He's pretty much resigned. Just wants to go out with a bang. And another pun, what time do you get off? [She smiles at them.]
So, how was it? Was the amateur as good as the pro?
Never mind.
Wallets go in the minibar freezer. If there's no minibar, the toilet tank. I've got exactly… [He counts his money.] $20 left.
No, we won't. I'm still on probation. Leaving the state without permission will really P.O. my P.O.
Just wondering how long this can last.
I'm actually hoping you won't. I like Kyle. [He puts his cap on backwards.]
Whoo!
This is Oubliette, Ohio. Buses don't run here after 1968.
Ina is living in Alzheimersville. [He looks at his watch.] Been here at least half an hour.
Cab.
Bus isn't coming, Ina. But this cab is going to Naples.
We'll tell the cabbie to call the cops. They'll come pick her up, take care of her.
Oh, God, here it comes.
I swear, I will jump out of this moving bus if you don't shut up.
Kyle would've ditched that sad, old woman from the bus stop. Probably would've ditched me too. I can live without Kyle. [They look at each other and give each other a small smile. No need to say anything else.] Snowball? [He has a couple of them with him!]
Not yet. You come here so I could talk you out of it?
It's been fun.
Sounded pithier than… "We've shared a variety of situations."
Legal loophole. 13th Amendment. Abraham Lincoln may have looked great in that hat, but his labor policies…ß [Suddenly, his eyes catch something on the monitor. He looks shocked.]
Come on in.
(coming back to his front door) Good plan. You'll be dead in five months.
With two weeks on, two weeks off of chemo, you'll have way more than a year, maybe two or three.
I'm not gonna let you just die.
(opening the envelope) First game is October 8th. That's about one month after Wilson's expiration date. This isn't an unstructured collaboration. You're trying to be the new Wilson.
Relax. I'm probably not gonna fall apart. (Foreman leaves)
(dumping his backpack on a chair) Put down the pom-poms. Step away from the computer.
46-year-old oncologist refuses treatment.
Wilson is dying. Chase is gone. How close to normal do you think we can come?
Wow. Cool. I just completely forgot that my best friend is dying. Wait. That just reminded me.
How can we turn Wilson from a terminal idiot into an interminable pain in the ass?
My best friend is trying to kill himself.
There's no such thing.
It's a midline granuloma. Get your patient a PET scan.
Foreman's trying to date me. I assume that's because you called him.
You know how you can be there for me five months from now? Don't be dead five months from now.
Just a little picker-downer. I assume this unwanted interruption means you're looking for me to discuss the latest development in the case I don't want to discuss.
Yeah. You really need me. Ultrasound his abdomen to check for schizophrenia.
Ultrasound his dorm.
And lo, he is risen.
No. All I did was temporarily kill you. How was it?
You're saying the end is not the end? I was expecting "nothing is better than something lousy," but not "the angels are waiting for me."
Why? 'Cause it doesn't make sense?
There is no heaven. There is no hell. Your soul is not gonna float out of your body and join some great unifying energy force. The fact that you're dying is not gonna change that.
(from behind him) Hey. Saved us a table.
I recently hacked into your old files. Found a six-year-old boy with bilateral retinoblastoma. Doctors wanted to take his eyes out before the cancer spread to his brain, and you fought them. Advocated for a new photon beam radiation. Saved the kid's vision. Probably saved his life.
Oh, yeah. This is our table.
(breaking the light mood with a stern look) He's going to be a doctor instead of being dead.
I wonder… (loudly, to the whole cafeteria) Hey! Is there anybody else here who's alive today because of Dr. James Wilson?
I did the math. 74 children are alive today because of you. 14 grandchildren.
They're somewhere. They're giving you a standing "O" somewhere. They exist. You saved their lives.
(calling out as Wilson leaves) Its actually more impressive that they're too busy to be here.
Your shoes are wet.
Hi, this is Greg House. Again. Third message, hopefully indicating how much I want you to call me back. I'd say that your son is dying to increase the urgency, but you probably already know that. (he ends the call) The fake people who care that Wilson stays alive didn't work, so I need the real people who care about him to tell him what an idiot he's being.
I just got paged to go to the bathroom. I don't know where the rest of you are going.
(pocketing the pill bottle and continuing down the hall) Let's assume… that all his symptoms are real symptoms.
I didn't say I had to go in.
You taking me up on my offer to off you? Think I've still got some leftover propofol.
He's angry because I want him to live longer. Who wouldn't be?
Loyalty is a tool to get people to do things they don't wanna do.
I surrender. (entering the office) I have been a disloyal… disrespectful jerk. I should have listened to what you wanted.
(sitting down across from Wilson) I made a reservation for two at Carmine's. Tonight. 8:00. No more tricks. No more manipulations.
Just… two friends enjoying the time they have left.
I'm not. I promise.
That depends on how much you have to drink.
Well, it cured her hiccups.
I didn't expect her to cry for quite so long.
(spotting the waiter as he approaches their table) Now, I know that the tiramisu is great here, but I actually ordered off-menu.
(following Wilson’s lead and picking up a cookie) It was a smart bear. I'm almost certain he untied my knots.
You hiked for 32 miles eating nothing but creamy filling.
(toasting with their Oreos) To climbing the hill.
Don't do that to me Wilson.
(carefully) I… I think that's reasonable. (He takes a sip of coffee)
Wha— just because you folded, that means it must be some evil plan?
That was real nostalgia. It was real emotion, a real decision.
I need you, okay? I want you to be around as long as possible. 'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.
Look at you. You don't wanna die.
Well, then fight.
One time.
You don't have to just accept this.
(with tears in his eyes) No. I'm not gonna tell you that unless you fight.
We got a case. Assume the status is, patient's getting worse. You guys are confused.
I got an airtight alibi, that I'm working on.
I'm done with Wilson.
It's in his hands now. Get any good pictures before the MRI drowned?
(motioning toward the team) Come with me.
(to Derrick) Hey.
So what do you think's gonna happen when I stick a needle into his eardrum?
Oh, this is a good quiz.
Don't listen to her. Very small needle, very steady hand.
Now, when I pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out?
Boy, that air sure is red. Persistent stapedial artery. It should disappear in the embryonic stage, but just like his dead brother, he really can't let go. An artery's been pressing against the temporal lobe of his brain, right above the ear canal. It explains the voices, the dizziness, everything. Now you guys can explain how we're gonna make him better.
(continuing to walk down the hallway) I just cured a patient. How 'bout you?
(shouting) Life is pain! I wake up every morning, I'm in pain. I go to work in pain. You know how many times I wanted to just give up? How many times I thought about ending it?
You here to yell at me or give me hockey tickets?
You can't wait to die?
Here, let me help you.
See? You wanna live!
You're resisting me because it's our human responsibility to stay alive!
(loudly) Not home.
Why?
No. You're the only one I listen to. The last couple of days, I didn't, and I almost killed my patient. So I think it's time for me to accept that… you're just smarter than I am.
No. But it's better than nothing.
I'm not gonna say "I love you."
You do realize that my leg situation has deteriorated a little since the last time we went hiking.
Yes. I have decided not to proceed with the sexual harassment case.
Gregory Danger House. It's… a very common name.
(standing up) Why don't you tell me how many hours of picking up trash you want me to do.
(swallowing hard) And that's… that's how long?
(demanding) How long?
[quietly] Hey.
You're dead too.
For all I know, I already am up. More interesting question is why would I hallucinate an ex-employee who I last saw with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, as opposed to someone more… busty? [Kutner takes his gum out of his mouth and looks around.] Care to explain why you're here?
I won a swimming trophy in high school. Your turn.
Take off your shirt. [puts down the patient file]
Orbital fracture means your face went into the windshield, which means your chest went into the steering wheel. Painkillers can suppress heart rate, so unless you want me to kill you, take off your shirt, let me do a heart exam.
I also wanted to see the ring of burns around your collarbone.
Cullen's sign. But the ultrasound showed air as well as blood. Now, I know what you're thinking. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis. But I also know what I'm thinking. Doesn't explain the pneuomoperitoneum.
I saw the chance to help someone in need, and I instinctively — Oh, no, wait, that was someone else's instinct.
Did you never see Dead Poets Society? Carpe diem.
Nobody cares about the medicine. It was a perforated ulcer. Laparotomy to find the hole in his tummy and close it up.
Which is weird, because normally, when I talk to my own employees, I'm under oath and hooked up to a lie detector.
Obviously I had a plan.
I need a meeting.
[reaching into his pocket] Yes… because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.
I need a meeting. [Foreman hangs up. House puts his cell phone back in his pocket.] Thanks for fitting me in. My team has eight urgent, life-or-death cases that they've been waiting for me to accept or reject.
Well, right now, for one. But tell my parole board that I'm taking all eight… that no one else can crack them; that you need me here for the next five months or eight people will die.
It's a tiny, white lie. No offense. Especially since, from what I hear, nothing black is tiny. Except your penis, I guess. [Foreman pushes for the elevator] You really think I wanted to cave in that ceiling? It was a prank that went wrong. Dock my pay, sue me—
[serious] I will go to jail, eventually. I will pay the price. I just rather that Wilson didn't. Come on, be a friend.
How many fingers am I holding up? [He puts his hand behind his back.] Of course you know it's three, because you know everything I know. Everything my smack-addled brain can remember, including that I actually said, "be a friend."
Well, here's a reason. I can't even get stoned without some annoying jerk deciding I need to be deeply analyzed. Isn't this just an incredibly simple calculation? I'm going to jail, losing my job, losing my best friend. Do I need more?
I'm also a tremendous baritone. Now go away.
Can I have Kutner back, please?
How are things in hell? Is the humidity the big issue?
Why?
There was a code.
Five… four… three… two…
Naloxone. We should've got suspicious when his visiting cousin signed in as "Mr. Tar H. Horse." Heroin caused the respiratory distress. The naloxone turned off the receptors, caused your distress.
You're saying I'm lying… to my subconscious?
He said every one of those things.
I compressed the story a little—
Feeling better?
You were a stockbroker. Son of a stockbroker. Married, children.
Well, you say you were miserable because you need to rationalize screwing it up.
But then you lost everything.
He's happy.
There's oxygen everywhere.
They weren't interesting.
Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to tell the parole board something else. Maybe that I was in the O.R. the entire day the ceiling collapsed, so I couldn't have caused the plumbing problem.
Not really. You were going to basically perjure yourself so that I could delay jail time. Doesn't it make more sense to actually perjure yourself so that I can actually avoid jail time?
There's no risk. I know you. You'll do the honest thing. You'll lie.
He's happy.
Of course I was worried. My plan fell through.
I noticed a slight twitch in his thenar eminence, which meant… [to Oliver] You're dying.
Plus the thinning in the muscle, plus that speech you gave at Yankee Stadium saying you were the luckiest man on the face of the earth. Add them up, it means ALS.
If it makes you feel any better, at this rate, it'll be fast. [As Oliver drops his head onto his pillow, House, standing on the right side of the bed, continues to observe him.] You're not symmetrical.
And lo, there was a miraculous wonder — I walked across the room.
He swore that he would live a better and more selfless life in his remaining time, blah, blah, blah. After two blahs, I'd heard enough. I moved to the door.
Do you smell smoke?
[to Oliver] You're not symmetrical. The veins on your right side are distended.
[examining Oliver’s neck] There's a bulge in your superclavicular notch. There's something in there.
Well, I'm not that good a doctor. [pulls over an ultrasound machine and checks Oliver’s neck] Good news: your case is fascinating. And good news for you: you're gonna live.
[voice over] You've inhaled a small branch, probably while you were realizing that it's all worth it, while you were passed out on a park bench. Anyone else would have coughed it up, but 'cause you're a junkie, your cough reflex is suppressed.
[voice over] Not unless you also inhaled a chunk of the sun and a drip-irrigation system, you idiot. It set off an auto-immune reaction, which — I can't help saying this — was the root of all your problems. [Taub holds up a small piece of a fir branch, including the needles.]
I was, and now I'm not. Because a moment's fun a few days ago does not trump a friend dying.
Every patient that I've had, 70 years from now, they'll all be as dead as Wilson. Everybody dies. It's meaningless.
Your theory is I'm not leaving, because I believe in God? What, he's calling me home?
No. Except that some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner is here telling me—
Pascal's wager is facile.
You can't live your life based on something you don't believe.
Foreman wouldn't help me, which means I need you to take the fall.
Which is you will never spend a day in jail. Fresh-faced, cancer-ridden. It's tough to do both, but you pull it off.
All you have to do is create reasonable doubt.
That is a risk you are willing to take.
[sincerely] Wilson… I don't want to lose this time with you.
Thanks. I knew I could count on you.
[stops, mouth full] You want the fries back?
Don't do this to me, Wilson. This is our only option.
Since you're here, and you are bailing me out, it seems like a pretty safe assumption.
How to act when you're gone? 'Cause if that's the lesson, we got a really great opportunity coming up.
So that's the great wisdom you're imparting? That I'll always be alone?
[pause, quietly] I thought there were two.
I always wondered why I photographed so poorly.
People don't change. Consciences don't spontaneously develop.
This is a reason to die. This is what my life could've been, not what it can be.
You're married. Cuddy's gone.
Why settle so easily? [The kiss with one of the identically clad cheerleaders surrounding him ends and he turns to the girl on the other side for a kiss.] These are just idiotic fantasies…
… at odds with every logical bone in my body.
Is this hell? An eternity of people trying to convince me to live?
You're the last one I thought would hate me.
And yet you think I deserve to die.
Like Wilson did?
I had a chance to avoid this.
No, this was different.
That moment with the patient… the chunk of the conversation I skipped over… I told him he was dying.
If it makes you feel any better, at this rate, it'll be fast.
[puzzled] You don't owe me anything.
I failed. Motives don't matter. Only actions.
Thank you. [stands and crosses to the door] And you're doing this because you're dying?
[thinking through this puzzle] So when you were living, you did nothing for anyone and you didn't care. Now that you're dying, you're willing to help a virtual stranger. Which means you're a better person dying than you ever were living, and the world is a better place because I didn't save you. Which makes me wonder why I'm about to tell you… you're not symmetrical.
If I kept it to myself, then it would just be a puzzle, but I opened my mouth because I thought it was more.
You're right. But I can change.
Hi.
I got out of the back of the building.
Just switched the dental records.
I'm dead, Wilson. How do you want to spend your last five months?
Cancer's boring.
