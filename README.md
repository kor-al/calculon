"Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail m–µ a sword with which to slay this wretched curse."

## What is this?
Calculon is a Generative Dialog System in that it tries to generate dialogs based on different TV-show charactes' scripts.
As now, Calculon only works with Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory and Dr. Gregory House from Dr. House.

## Why the name?
Calculon is an acting robot from the Futurama comedy series; since our project is aiming to reproduce characters' personalities, we thought that the name was well justified

## How does it work?
Calculon uses a markov-chain based model to generate text from context extracted from in previous sentences of the dialog. There are different evaluation metrics in place before accepting a generated dialog.

## Evaluation:
We evaluate generated sentences based on their syntax as well as semantics. We are using WordNet based algorithm to evaluate semantic similarity within conversations.

## Install instructions:
First of all, clone the repository from the current master:<br />
`$ git clone https://github.com/crybot/calculon`

Then move into the directory and install the requirements:<br />
`$ cd calculon` </br >
`$ python3 install requirements.txt`
(you may need to install cobe from this pull request https://github.com/pteichman/cobe/pull/26 to support python3)

Then if everything went well, you should be able to execute the program by: <br />
`$ cd main_package` </br >
`$ python3 calculon.py [generate | chat (sheldon|house)]`

### Example usage:
If you want to chat with Sheldon Cooper you will have to execute the following command: <br />
`$ python3 calculon.py chat sheldon`

If, on the other hand, you would like to generate a dialog between the two available characters (Sheldon and House): <br />
`$ python3 calculon.py generate > generated_dialog.txt`<br />
will save the dialog inside generated_dialog.txt.

## Example dialog:
This is one of the dialogs generated by the system:
> sheldon: Uh, can you identify our cricket? <br />
house: No, but I can t diagnose you.<br />
sheldon: : No, you re mad at me.<br />
house: Under New Jersey law, you re good.<br />
sheldon: Oh, Leonard, you may change your mind.<br />
house: Oh, do you want a reason?<br />
sheldon: Oh, you want to go to Jewish heaven?<br />
house: Oh he's going to have a life.<br />
sheldon: I m going, and you have to offer.<br />
house: So, what are you going to trust them?<br />
